SENTENCES AND THEIR PERPLEXITY


1. it exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much	the same criticisms.	8.728591527828165
2. the treatment seems unnecessarily loose-jointed	and complex largely because the method is lax and the analysis seems	never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point.	6.615961936568926
3. there are more stems per item in athabascan which expresses the fact	that the athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in	diverging from proto-athabascan than the yokuts languages from proto-yokuts.	6.185036032343352
4. this may be because the athabascan divergence began earlier;	or again because the athabascan languages spread over a very much	larger territory; or both.	8.631973106403073
5. the differentiation however is not very much greater as shown by	the fact that athabascan shows 3.	6.538213540886913
6. 46 stems per meaning slot as against	2.	9.060328853487057
7. 75 for yokuts with a slightly greater number of languages represented	in our sample: 24 as against 21.	5.502176915627405
8. 46 the stemitem rate becomes 3.	9.670406878971576
9. 75 in equivalent number	these general facts are mentioned to make clear	that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant	comparison.	5.179837570019059
10. the greatest difference in the two sets of figures	is due to differences in the two sets of lists used.	10.332046148128628
11. these differences	in turn result from the fact that my yokuts vocabularies were	built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of english meaning	between illiterate informants and myself within a compact and uniform	territorial area but that hoijer's vocabulary is based on swadesh's	second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating	all items which might be culturally or geographically determined.	5.028892733101507
12. swadesh	in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal;	i one that was specifically adapted to the san joaquin valley.	6.844087594098681
13. the	result is that i included 70 animal names but swadesh only 4;	and somewhat similarly for plants 16 as against 4.	5.087179511422533
14. swadesh and therefore	hoijer felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even	genera; their	classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or	recurrent parts.	6.046219493410928
15. the groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as	in size.	6.817408452020724
16. other classes are included only by myself	or only by swadesh and hoijer.	7.978194376184139
17. what we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes:	body parts and products which with a proportionally nearly	even representation come out with	nearly even ratios; 2.	6.12313065054314
18. 7; nature	ratios 3.	13.148092146312546
19. 1; ratios 3.	8.97651057505685
20. 7; ratios 4.	13.148092146312546
21. 4.	15.610129252044759
22. it will be seen that where the scope is similar the athabascan ratios	come out somewhat higher	except for verbs where alone the athabascan	ratio is lower.	9.045337757272964
23. this exception may be connected with hoijer's	use of a much higher percentage of verbs: 22% of his total	list as against 3.	5.98896769908699
24. or the exception may be due to a particular	durability peculiar to the athabascan verb.	8.61877755139381
25. more word class ratios	determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the	question.	7.5205271291023905
26. if word classes differ in their resistance or liability	to stem replacement within meaning slot it is conceivable that	individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually.	7.786097295641408
27. hoijer's athabascan and my yokuts share 71 identical meanings	allowance for several near-synonyms like stomach-belly big-large	.	5.427950274147271
28. for yokuts	i tabulated these 71 items in five columns according as they were expressed	by 1 2 3 4 and more than 4 stems.	7.595570160058267
29. the totals for these	five categories are not too uneven namely 20 15 11 16 9 respectively.	6.524770666309441
30. for athabascan with a greater range of stems the first two	of five corresponding columns were identical 1 and 2 stems; the three	others had to be spread somewhat and are headed respectively f;	f; and f stems.	6.550606834276504
31. while the particular limits of these groupings	may	seem artificially arbitrary; they do fairly express a corresponding	grouping of more variable material and they eventuate also in five	classes along a similar scale containing approximately equal numbers	of cases namely 19 14 15 11 12 in athabascan.	4.682836779562854
32. when now	we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing	in the same column or grade or one column or grade apart or	two or three or four we find these differences: f   this distribution	can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart:	f; which divided by f gives a mean of 1.	6.434128523283288
33. if	the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families	the distance would of course be 0.	6.513384599908015
34. if it were wholly random	and unrelated it would be 2.	16.735658098076957
35. 0 assuming the five classes were equal in	n which approximately they are.	5.825820622377272
36. the actual mean of 1.	14.473707740438117
37. 07 being	about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.	6.210871206873012
38. 0 of no correlation	it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity	in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning	as regards long-term stem displacement.	7.955102452449978
39. in 1960 david d	thomas published basic vocabulary in some mon-khmer languages	which compares 8 mon-khmer languages	with the i-e language data on which swadesh based the revised	retention	rate and his revised 100 word	basic	glottochronological list in towards greater accuracy h	.	5.149571480829994
40. thomas' findings are first that the individual	items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence;	but second that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying	in their average persistence	first conclusion on behavior of individual items is negative whereas	mine was partially positive.	5.624255452947053
41. his second	conclusion	on semantic word classes agrees with mine.	7.591810951946381
42. this second conclusion	independently arrived at by independent study of material from two	pairs of language families as different and remote from one another	as these four are cannot be ignored.	6.799513485470034
43. thomas also presents a	simple equation for deriving an index of persistence which weights not	only the number of stems per meaning but their relative	frequency.	5.4177742112174165
44. thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per	meaning is: stem identical in 8 languages 100%; stem frequencies	7 and 1 86%; stem frequencies 4 and 4 64%; stem frequencies	4 3 and 1 57%.	6.06372728998952
45. his formula will have to be weighed may be	altered or improved and it should be tested on additional bodies of	material.	7.322069196929417
46. but consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning	seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations	with diachronic and classificatory relevance; and gleason	presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area.	7.723310418697585
47. as to relative frequencies of competing roots	thomas with his 'weighting' seems to be the first to have considered	the significance this might have.	8.547756579228864
48. the problem needs further	exploration.	22.165869735070007
49. i was at least conscious of the distinction in my full	yokuts presentation that awaits publication in which in listing 'two-stem	meanings' i set off by asterisks those forms in which	n of stem b was f of stem a3 the unasterisked ones	standing for f; or under 'four stems' i set off by asterisks	cases where the combined n of stems f was f.	4.8797042156450265
50. these	findings and others which will in time be developed will affect	the method of glottochronological inquiry.	6.886249538313906
51. if adjectival meanings show	relatively low retentiveness of stems as i am confident will prove	to be the case in most languages of the world why should our basic	lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms but only 8 per cent	of animals and plants which replace much more slowly?	6.13463513531446
52.  had hoijer	substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items	his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of athabascan	language separation smaller.	7.298545742196723
53. and irrespective of the outcome	in centuries elapsed since splitting calculations obviously carry more	concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable	units	than with variously unstable ones.	5.767439297566063
54. it is evident that swadesh	has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages	but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior	of lexical items.	8.480552742907495
55. why then this urge to include unstable items	in his basic list?	7.68928528155087
56.  it is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical	and cultural conditioning as possible.	12.442278316468771
57. and why that insistence?	14.555411229397368
58. 	it is the hope of attaining a list of items of universal occurrence.	9.465001668613668
59. but it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is	a snare.	12.424296328749232
60. not that such a list cannot be constructed; but the nearer	it comes to attaining universality the less significant will it be	linguistically.	7.844105784047764
61. its terms will tend to be labile or vague and they	will fit actual languages more and more badly.	6.42576203557217
62. the practical operational	problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic	list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms	of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison.	7.290353792070676
63. the most important	quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as	possible.	9.832938595357035
64. in proportion as meanings are concrete we can better rely	on their being insulated and distinctive.	8.437918402470649
65. an elephant or a fox or a swan	or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality	of obvious common-sense indubitable identity as do an eye	or tooth or nail.	4.78159956739805
66. they isolate out easily naturally and unambiguously	from the continuum of nature and existence; and they should be	given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these	qualities.	7.5163949304143935
67. with the universal list as his weapon swadesh	has	extended his march of conquest farther and farther into the past eight	ten twelve millennia back.	6.230423970274787
68. and he has proclaimed greater or less	affiliation between all western hemisphere languages.	11.58297419486788
69. some of this	may prove to be true or even considerable of it whether by genetic	ramification or by diffusion and coalescence.	6.794930051879173
70. but the farther out he	moves the thinner will be his hold on conclusive evidence and the larger	the speculative component in his inferences.	7.749359232300311
71. he has traversed provinces	and kingdoms but he has not consolidated them behind him nor	does he control them.	7.8177381748128925
72. he has announced results on hokan penutian	uto-aztecan and almost all other american families and phyla and	has diagrammed their degree of interrelation; but he has not worked	out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of	even a single family other than salish.	6.98735958858241
73. the	remote cloudy possible has values of its own- values of scope	stimulus potential and imagination.	5.542917982132687
74. but there is also a firm aspect	to lexicostatistics: the aspect of learning the internal organization	of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well as their more	remote and elusive external links; of classification first with elapsed	age merely a by-product; of acquiring evidential knowledge of	what happened in athabascan in yokuts in uto-aztecan in the last	few thousand years as well as forecasting what more anciently may have	happened between them.	6.996827000608089
75. this involves step-by-step progress and such	will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing	body of scientific inquiry.	6.66389881289832
76. if of the founders of glottochronology	swadesh has escaped our steady plodding and lees has repudiated his	own share in the founding that is no reason why we should swerve.	8.503651134789727
77. there is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by swadesh's	rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown	so vast.	7.69902962183697
78. it seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures	for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble solid and limited basis.	9.248917704121226
79. i would propose first an abandonment of attempts at a	universal lexical list as intrinsically unachievable and operationally	inadequate in proportion as it is achieved.	7.014494436854544
80. i would propose	next as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists	items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible.	7.607930874954649
81. there would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme	of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable.	8.693824794246563
82. an attempted	middle course might lead to devices like a 5000-word alphabetized dictionary	from which every fiftieth word was selected.	7.03398687827998
83. doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should	arise about the methods for applying these policies.	5.708822330446606
84. it was nevertheless	almost incredible that four years after yalta there should be a	complete split over germany with hot heads on both sides planning to	use the germans against their former allies and with nazi-minded germans	expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the	other.	7.473001118686811
85. when the yalta conference	opened the american policy of postponing all discussion of russia's	western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down.	6.126432428280739
86. starting	in great force late in december from a line stretching from	east prussia to budapest the red armies had swept two hundred miles	across poland to the oder thirty miles from berlin and the upper	danube region was being rapidly overrun while the western allies	had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the rhine.	5.657925738234017
87. the long	delay in opening the second front was now working to russia's advantage.	6.916450125045957
88. the west was now glad to propose the 1919 curzon line	which was substantially russia's 1941 border as the boundary between	russia and poland.	7.762277199031083
89. when this proposal was made stalin spoke	with stronger emotion than at any other time during the conference.	8.106352765305958
90. he stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject.	10.302529178852147
91. the bitter	memory of russia's exclusion from the paris peace conference	and of the west's effort to stamp out bolshevism at its birth boiled	up within him.	5.377873882341562
92. you would drive us into shame he declared.	13.406219579674467
93. the white russians and the ukrainians would say that stalin and molotov	were far less reliable defenders of russia than curzon and clemenceau.	6.075272924218582
94. yet after long and earnest discussion stalin accepted	the curzon line and even agreed voluntarily that there should be	digressions from that line of five to eight kilometers in favor of poland	in some regions.	7.306409119000506
95. he did not mind the line itself which churchill	declared in the house of commons on february 27 1945 he had	always believed to be just and right but he did not want it called	by a hated name.	7.4257187932759035
96. the west had long since forgotten the events	of 1919 but it was not so easy for the red leaders who felt that they	had suffered great injustice in that period.	8.618551205849084
97. in the dunn-atherton	memorandum of february 4 1942 the state department had expected	to be able to hold russia in check by withholding agreement to	her 1941 boundaries.	6.832600518618727
98. now stalin made it clear that he meant to move	poland's western borders deep into germany back to the western	neisse-oder river lines taking not only east prussia and all of	silesia but pomerania and the tip of brandenburg back to and including	stettin.	6.832171002716006
99. from six to nine million additional germans would be	evicted though most would have fled and poland would receive far more	from germany than the poor territories including the great pripet	marshes which she lost to russia.	4.827482875085593
100. stalin declared that he preferred	to continue the war a little longer although it costs us blood	in order to give poland compensation in the west at the expense	of the germans.	6.819269873304742
101. by this time churchill was not so cordial toward	moving poland westward as he had been at teheran where he and	eden had both heartily approved the idea.	6.969062989540919
102. after a prolonged study	of the oder line on a map at teheran churchill liked the	picture.	8.74814951941821
103. he would tell the poles he said that they had been given	a fine place to live in more than three hundred miles each way.	9.564420203776912
104. at yalta he thought more about the six million germans who would	have to leave trying to find work in germany and roosevelt objected	to the western neisse river being chosen in the south instead	of the eastern neisse both of which flow into the oder.	6.906432085468935
105. the	issue was left in abeyance presumably for the peace conference.	6.210871206873012
106. however	there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong	poland both industrially and agriculturally and one unplagued by large	minorities of germans or russians.	7.364264802002414
107. the moving of millions of the	german master-race from the very heart of junkerdom to make room	for the polish slavs whom they had enslaved and openly planned to exterminate	was a drastic operation but there was little doubt that it	was historically justified.	5.895075327715992
108. of more importance to	the west than poland's boundaries was the character of her government.	9.827207519900966
109. at yalta the west still believed that eastern europe could	be kept in its orbit in spite of the onrushing soviet armies.	6.91362909063379
110. though	little democracy had ever been practised in this region and much of	it was still ruled by feudalistic means it was taken for granted that	at least the forms of western democracy would be established in this	area and western capitalism preserved within it.	5.801716268605972
111. believing devoutly	as they did in anglo-saxon institutions it was important to both	roosevelt and churchill that the poles should have them.	5.582660386211355
112. the	issue was acute because the exiled polish government in london supported	in the main by britain was still competing with the new lublin	government formed behind the red army.	6.285623209801457
113. more time was spent in	trying to marry these imcompatibles than over any subject discussed at	yalta.	6.613882986952077
114. the result was an agreement that the lublin government should	be reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion	of democratic leaders from poland itself and from the poles abroad	and pledged to hold free and unfettered elections as soon as possible	on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot.	7.171389008449886
115. all	democratic and anti-nazi parties were to have the right to campaign.	8.60017061892347
116. roosevelt acted as moderator of the long debate on this	issue.	9.002912367916855
117. it was a matter of principle with churchill since britain had	declared war in behalf of poland.	10.710732658326823
118. to stalin it was a matter of	life and death.	12.691818152519138
119. he made this completely clear.	15.6592618679761
120. speaking with great	earnestness he said: for the russian people the question	of poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security.	7.851115675798787
121. throughout history poland has been the corridor through which	the enemy has passed into russia.	7.19285726202354
122. twice in the last thirty years our	enemies the germans have passed through this corridor.	8.642096335028143
123. it is in	russia's interest that poland should be strong and powerful in a	position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force h.	6.663715531423359
124. it	is necessary that poland should be free independent in power.	8.859844267374644
125. therefore	it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the	soviet state.	7.570220816879001
126. in other words the soviet union was determined	to create a poland so strong as to be a powerful bulwark against	germany and so closely tied to russia that there would never be any	question of her serving as a cordon sanitaire against the soviets	or posing as an independent balancing power in between russia and	germany.	8.268957984674692
127. byrnes says that invariably thereafter the soviets used	the same security argument to justify their course in poland.	5.236383152695367
128. this reasoning	was also as inevitable as anything could be.	10.192728591488759
129. any free elections	that were to be held in poland would have to produce a government	in which moscow had complete confidence and all pressure from the west	for free voting by anti-soviet elements in poland would be met	by	restrictions on voting by these elements.	5.717477385890362
130. in even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of eastern	europe where the upper classes had generally collaborated with	the nazis even to the extent of sending millions of their peasants into	russia as a part of hitler's armies.	8.489818451404345
131. but at yalta the conflicting	expectations of east and west were merged into an agreement by	the big three to assist all liberated countries in europe to	create	democratic institutions of their own choice.	6.531336251593324
132. in any case where	in their judgment conditions require italics added they	would form interim governmental authorities broadly representative	of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the earliest	possible establishment through free elections of governments responsive	to the will of the people.	7.450455915064485
133. other similar affirmations in the	declaration on liberated europe seemed to assure democratic institutions	on the western model.	5.662445231778413
134. later it developed that the soviets had	a very different interpretation of democracy which will be discussed	later and their judgment never told them that the big three should	unite in establishing democratic conditions as we understand them	within their zone of influence.	6.299738400638366
135. professor mcneill thinks that	at yalta stalin did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him	that he thought the exclusion of the anti-soviet voters from east	european	elections would not be greatly resented by his allies while	neither roosevelt nor churchill frankly faced the fact that in poland	at least genuinely free democratic elections would return governments	unfriendly to russia by any definition of international friendliness.	4.7797399001735625
136. also war-time propaganda and cooperation had obscured	the differences between russian and western ideas of democracy	and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal formulae than to imperil	the military victories over germany and japan.	6.468543815099058
137. the application	of these formulae could not please both sides for they really	attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable.	5.670580783382225
138. while obliged	to concede governments in east europe allied with the soviet union	instead of opposed to it we thought we had preserved our social and	economic system in east europe.	6.6370135465677
139. this illusion was described	in a far-sighted editorial in the new york herald tribune on	march 5 1947 in connection with the submission of the satellite peace	treaties to the senate.	6.4527692069919995
140. in doing so marshall and byrnes were asking	for the ratification of a grim lesson in the facts of international	life.	10.507985048394366
141. we had entertained exaggerated ideas about our victory	automatically establishing our system throughout the world.	7.374608544721289
142. we	were troubled about the fate of the baltic states.	9.474622358488796
143. yalta left us with	comforting illusions of a western capitalist-democratic political	economy reigning supreme up to the curzon line and the borders of bessarabia.	5.2837367373482085
144. this is a penetrating description	of our post-war illusion which applied to other areas than east	europe.	11.495982403811642
145. the same editorial continued that we expected to democratize	japan and korea and to see a new china pattern itself easily	on our institutions.	6.715385273756662
146. we expected in short that most of the world	would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple	from such a position to deal with the localized aberrations of	the soviet union.	10.20258988595082
147. yet actually the image corresponded in no	way to the actualities of the post-war world.	6.243154353761418
148. neither our military our	economic nor our ideological power reached far enough to determine	the fate of east europe.	7.3017019872740265
149. then the editorial added prophetically:	how far they may reach in asia is yet undetermined but they fall	far short of our dreams of the war conferences.	5.965493587431165
150. here is	the best short explanation of the origins of the cold war that has been	written.	11.13548449334414
151. failing to heed the lesson so clearly contained in the satellite	treaties president truman re-declared the cold war on march	12 1947 in the truman doctrine exactly one week after the herald	tribune editorial was written and a year after the cold war	had been announced by churchill at fulton missouri in truman's	presence.	5.090988947246331
152. then china promptly went communist and mr truman	had to fight the interminable korean war for the democratization of	korea before we learned how far our writ did reach in asia.	6.751343930133445
153. years of war strain and hatred; of heavy arms expenditures	and constant danger of another world war had to ensue before the united	states could bring itself to accept the two chief results of world	a	while the cold war raged it was easy to blame	it all on yalta.	5.2738299689048365
154. yet in summarizing a series of careful essays	on the yalta conference forrest pogue could find no basis for yalta	becoming a symbol for betrayal and a shibboleth for the opponents	of roosevelt and international cooperation.	6.809470125442189
155. when the yalta papers	were finally published with great fanfare they had revealed no betrayal	by anyone.	7.170514433846036
156. an analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts.	11.553411397498767
157. first	is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation planning	and discussion.	6.128169709851021
158. preparation began slightly more than a year after	independence with the first steps to organize rural communes.	10.417059200410714
159. all	political interests supported electoral planning although there are some	signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to	some procrastination.	5.0176589645046334
160. the second major aspect of the election is the	actual procedure of registration nomination and voting.	10.818179727270726
161. considerable	technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was	generally above reproach.	5.84660975948877
162. however the regionally differentiated results	which appear below in tables are interesting evidence of the problems	of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances.	7.920384203407302
163. a third aspect and probably the one open to most controversy	is the results of the election.	7.434516341352785
164. the electoral procedure prevented	the ready identification of party affiliation but all vitally interested	parties including the government itself were busily engaged in	determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the	month following the elections.	6.179445157832027
165. the fourth and concluding point will	be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they	figure in the current pattern of internal politics.	6.493803891370578
166. elections	have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official	address since independence.	7.391013650626644
167. they were stressed in the speeches	of si mubarak bekkai when the first council of ministers was formed	and again when the istiqlal took a leading role in the second council.	6.460546636110325
168. king muhammad 5 was known to be most sympathetic to the formation	of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections	on may day 1957.	6.44427897715385
169. there followed a long and sometimes bitter	discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 in	which it appears that the minister of the interior took the most pessimistic	view and that the istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic.	6.971495133471284
170. since the complicated process of establishing new communes and	reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the french did not even begin	until the fall of 1957 this goal appears somewhat ambitious.	7.806823074982413
171. from	the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues	in moroccan politics precisely the type of questions that were	most difficult to resolve in the new government.	5.572619663971186
172. until the charter	of liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 there were no guarantees	of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes.	10.450011052027602
173. the	istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 but the pdi	the most important minor	party at the time objected to the istiqlal's predominance in the	civil service and influence in radio maroc.	5.324532912262023
174. there were rumors that	the ministry of the interior favored an arbitrary non-political	process which were indirectly affirmed when the king personally intervened	in the planned meetings.	9.044077619414496
175. the day following his intervention	the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that h the	possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral	lists lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation	itself h would be supported by the king himself.	5.603841582805194
176. the ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration	of elections but french consultants were called in and notices of further	investigation appeared from time to time.	8.332206283466284
177. in january 1958 the	minister of the interior announced that an election law was ready	to be submitted to the king the rumors of election dates appeared once	again first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer.	5.693624332868143
178. although	the government was probably prepared for elections by mid-1958 the	first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied.	6.75533681256156
179. in late 1957 the mp appeared	and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the istiqlal was	revealed when the third council of government under balafrej was formed	without support from progressive elements in the party.	5.47237080781401
180. the parties	were on the whole unprepared for elections while the people were	still experiencing post-independence let-down and suffering the after	effects of poor harvests in 1957.	6.960659823226256
181. despite the internal and international	crises that harassed morocco the elections remained a central	issue.	7.285415757130493
182. they figured prominently in the balafrej government of may	1958 which the king was reportedly determined to keep in office until	elections could be held.	7.160570987016448
183. but the eagerly sought homogeneity	of the balafrej council of government was never achieved as the istiqlal	quarreled over foreign policy labor politics and economic development.	6.2507085193849115
184. by december 1958 when 'abdallah ibrahim became president	of the council elections had even greater importance.	7.642968805460743
185. they were	increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural	communes as the focus of a new constructive national effort.	7.522357603930598
186. to minimize	the chances of repeating the balafrej debacle the ibrahim government	was formed a titre personnel and a special office was created	in the ministry of the interior to plan and to conduct the elections.	6.586829808117976
187. by this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete.	10.547210313821306
188. there remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws	through the labyrinth of palace politics and making a small number	of	policy decisions.	7.929122625251148
189. from the rather tortuous history of electoral	planning in morocco an important point emerges concerning the first	elections in a developing country and evaluating their results.	5.6528382033448725
190. in	the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving	fundamental and sometimes bitter differences among leaders and	also as a source of policy guidance.	7.733390038209328
191. in the absence of a reservoir	of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections	will give them new prominence but in a system where there is	as yet no place for the less prominent.	7.159295084139272
192. lacking the respected and effective	institutions that consensus helps provide minority parties such	as the pdi in 1957 and the progressive istiqlal faction	in 1958 clamor for elections when out of power but are not at all	certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power.	6.1144830332333
193. those	in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral	process.	6.421517266114742
194. the tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest	rather than an instrument of national interest had two important	effects	on electoral planning in morocco.	7.069970374159982
195. at the central level	the scrutin uninominal voting system was selected over some form	of the scrutin de liste system even though the latter had been	recommended by duverger and favored by all political parties.	5.664062217885678
196. the	choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent	by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas	of the country but it also served to minimize the national political	value of the elections.	6.779453048484888
197. although the elections were for local officials	it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties	from publicly identifying their candidates.	6.153451869080469
198. with multiple member	districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have	operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to	state their positions more clearly.	7.173925272810416
199. both parties and the ministry of	the interior were busily at work after the elections trying to unearth	the political affiliations of the successful candidates and thereby	give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political	significance.	4.656320187142996
200. since a national interpretation cannot be avoided	it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize	party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation.	7.6280419081543185
201. the general setting of the moroccan election may	also encourage the deterioration of local party organization.	6.705619410468181
202. the concentration	of effective power in rabat leads not only to party bickering	but to distraction from local activity that might have had many	auxiliary benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections.	7.65517873809112
203. interesting evidence can be found in the results of the chamber	of commerce elections which took place three weeks before national	elections.	7.557053315604683
204. the istiqlal sponsored umcia	was opposed by candidates of the new unfp	in nearly all urban centers.	8.650464179651754
205. as the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy	businessmen the umcia was generally favored	against the more progressive labor-based unfp the	newer party campaigned heavily while the older more confident party	expected the moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them	as they had done for many years.	4.90027381963194
206. the local istiqlal and umcia	offices did not campaign and lost heavily.	9.727669392792654
207. the	value of the elections was lost both as an experiment in increased political	participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest	as shown in table 1.	5.55005866464757
208. the chamber of commerce elections	were of course an important event in the preparation for rural commune	elections.	9.362885930093052
209. the unfp learned that its urban organization	which depends heavily on umt support was most	effective.	6.374057384651866
210. the istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of	the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete	precise problems of internal politics.	7.808143956091679
211. the overall effect was probably	to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than	might have otherwise taken place.	5.780140237098333
212. a second major point of this	essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections.	9.19430332653682
213. although	a somewhat technical subject it has important political implications	as the above discussion of the voting system indicated.	5.799606327587134
214. furthermore	the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of	the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential	to evaluating election results.	6.157942065974489
215. the sine qua non of the elections	was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure.	6.578982329721101
216. as the	background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts	that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer	elections.	7.96197378631388
217. the pdi and later the popular movement protected	the istiqlal's privileged position until the fall of	balafrej and then the istiqlal used the same argument which it had	previously ignored against the pro-unfp tendencies	of the ibrahim government.	5.0312598380920734
218. the bulk of the preparation had	of course proceeded under the supervision of the ministry of the interior	whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally	disinterested in party politics.	7.226742745149268
219. apart from some areas of recurring	trouble like bani mellal where inexperienced officials had	been appointed there is little evidence that local officials intervened	in the electoral process.	6.201134422297981
220. centrally however the administrative	problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely	an unfair advantage.	6.54093796655646
221. the king decided to remove ibrahim a week	before elections and to institute a non-party council of government	under his personal direction.	6.061378810538841
222. although the monarch had frequently asserted	that the elections were to be without party significance his action	was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor.	7.472194433683841
223. the new council was itself inescapably of political meaning which	was most clearly revealed in the absence of any unfp	members and the presence of several istiqlal leaders.	7.031624960549305
224. since the	details of the elections were settled the change of government had no	direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections and may have	been	more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the unfp	voting preparations began in the fall of 1959	although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes	was completed in 1958.	6.860370799387775
225. there were three major administrative tasks:	the fixing of electoral districts the registration of voters and the	registration of candidates.	7.427087748900928
226. voter registration began in late november	1959 and continued until early january 1960.	7.391013650626644
227. the government was	most anxious that there be a respectable response.	9.147792072951319
228. periodic bulletins	of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process	into a kind of competition among provincial officials.	7.11028347841323
229. a goal was fixed	as given in table 2 and attention focused on its fulfillment.	6.211372457527363
230. the	qualifications to vote were kept very simple.	9.060328853487057
231. both men and women of	twenty-one years of age could register and vote upon presenting proof	of residence and identification.	6.954838211613299
232. there were liberal provisions for	dispensation where documents or records were lacking.	12.647783970494853
233. the police were	disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens criminals	and those punished for protectorate activities.	6.25259031312998
234. the	registration figures given in table 2 must be interpreted with caution	since the estimate for eligible electors were made without the benefit	of a reliable census.	6.09983039226678
235. unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment	in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to	secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future.	5.525808084284512
236. some	vocational training schools provide such training but the current	need exceeds the facilities.	7.391013650626644
237. the present federal	program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of	the smith-hughes act which provided a continuing annual appropriation	of $7 million to support on a matching basis state-administered	programs of vocational education in agriculture trades industrial skills	and home economics.	4.97195427074235
238. since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related	acts have extended this federal program.	8.57071945525527
239. the george-barden	act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to	$29 million in addition to the $7 million under the smith act.	6.475410319417189
240. the	health amendment act of 1956 added $5 million for practical nurse	training.	7.615092762846159
241. the latest major change in this program was introduced	by the national defense education act of 1958 title 8 of	which amended the george-barden act.	5.982898979100701
242. annual authorizations of $15	million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national	defense needs for highly skilled technicians.	6.44893033609597
243. the federal	program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage	the establishment of vocational education programs in public	schools.	5.780140237098333
244. the initiative administration and control remain primarily	with the local school districts.	9.877011301938534
245. even the states remain primarily in	an assisting role providing leadership and teacher training.	7.476792668086445
246. federal	assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure and the	state or local districts must pay at least half.	7.518150023141355
247. the state may decide	to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost or the state	may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it.	6.029373672957233
248. throughout the history of the program state government expenditures	in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the federal expenditures	while local districts all together have spent more than either	federal or state governments.	7.780590094788678
249. today federal funds account for only	one-fifth of the nation's expenditures for vocational education.	4.5794101963355365
250. the	greatest impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially	encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough	to obtain their full allocation of outside funds.	6.437696359584778
251. national defense	considerations have been the major reason behind most federal	training expenditures in recent decades.	6.507151094831106
252. during world war 2 about	7.	36.920297895012354
253. 5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special	programs administered by state and local school authorities:	vocational education for national defense and war production	training.	5.8915823609906806
254. the total cost of the five-year program was $297 million.	14.603880195401237
255. for the smith-hughes george-barden and national defense	act of 1958 the cumulative total of federal expenditures in 42 years	was only about $740 million.	6.000644291935016
256. no comparable measures are available	of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education	training.	8.520487136832335
257. there are a great number and variety of private commercial	schools trade schools and technical schools.	12.51215102780817
258. in addition many large	corporations operate their own formal training programs.	12.83380860212309
259. a recent study	indicated that 85 per cent of the nation's largest corporations	conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and examinations.	5.9315641004059865
260. most skilled industrial workers nevertheless still	acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions.	8.31406676878408
261. the national	manpower council of columbia university has estimated that	three out of five skilled workers and one out of five technicians have	not been formally trained.	5.762388837961701
262. there is little doubt that the students	benefit from vocational education.	30.214403434210066
263. employers prefer to hire youth	with such training rather than those without and most graduates of	vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training.	5.214865723259551
264. vocational	educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled	workers but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills.	6.44893033609597
265. in most states trade and industrial training is provided	in a minority of the high schools usually located in the larger cities.	7.121024978053326
266. in arkansas fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade	and industrial courses.	12.277591760098682
267. in illinois about 13 per cent of the schools	have programs and in pennsylvania 11 per cent.	8.81879744124936
268. an important	recent trend is the development of area vocational schools.	10.293697780295807
269. for	a number of years kentucky louisiana and several other states have	been building state-sponsored vocational education schools that serve	nearby school districts in several counties.	5.563219782861777
270. these schools are intended	to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not	be possible for very small school districts.	6.94999607377895
271. transportation may be	provided from nearby school districts.	7.14162538120728
272. courses are provided mainly for	post high school day programs; but sometimes arrangements also are	made for high school students to attend and evening extension courses	also may be conducted.	6.254431446250755
273. the title 8 program of the national	defense education act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward	area schools.	7.563651808746753
274. by 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states.	10.065628120255884
275. they were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor	surplus and in 10 of the minor areas.	0.0
276. an extension of this program into	relation to new	some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been	related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their	desire to attract new industry.	7.288072978192694
277. the major training need of a new	industrial plant is a short period of pre-employment training for a	large number of semi-skilled machine operators.	6.230206927876231
278. a few key skilled workers	experienced in the company's type of work usually must be brought	in with the plant manager or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere.	7.260278226014195
279. a prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run	advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers	and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees.	6.00098756648431
280. the existence of a public school vocational training program in	trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled.	7.25963014279634
281. additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs	worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities staff	and program are in being.	4.958578086944874
282. thus besides the training provided to youth	in school the existence of the school program can have supplementary	benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development	efforts.	7.3763097529501325
283. few states make effective use of their existing vocational	education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new	industry.	6.847167845290544
284. the opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their	vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis	to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that my be quickly	local focus	the major weakness of vocational training programs in	labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands.	5.668668216581743
285. this weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas for it is inherent	in the system of local school districts in this country.	6.30692726820347
286. planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to	local employer needs for trained workers.	6.886249538313906
287. all the manuals for setting	up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local	survey of skill needs of estimating the growth of local jobs	and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and	their content.	5.436987076064887
288. furthermore there is a cautious conservatism	on the part of those making local skill surveys.	10.804211971164948
289. local jobs can be seen	and counted while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical.	5.863668339877186
290. while the u s department of labor has a	program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and	publishing current outlook statements there is little tangible evidence	that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum	planning.	9.282266892317814
291. the u s office of education continues to stress	local surveys rather than national surveys.	9.744313100969636
292. this procedure is	extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history	of declining employment.	8.406814643643322
293. elaborate studies have been made in labor	surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job	vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify	training programs for those skills.	5.622877135680528
294. no effort is made in the same studies	to present information on regional or national demand trends in these	skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other	skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be	trained.	7.09195751232876
295. moreover the current information on what types of training	are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary.	6.385929246976759
296. there	simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that	are in demand and the types of training programs that are required	or most suitable.	6.69198329848934
297. much of the available information comes not from the	federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states.	7.691756325801561
298. state and local agencies in the vocational education	field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities.	8.431595530622063
299. there is a need for an expanded federal effort to provide	research and information to help guide state education departments and	local school boards in existing programs.	7.130769618740224
300. a related question	is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided.	8.67520113331406
301. there is little evidence that existing public or private training	programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in	their programs even though they must pay tuition receive no subsistence	payments and are not guaranteed a job.	6.4594915644075535
302. however there always is	some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire	training.	10.920109084842016
303. again one major difficulty is the local focus.	7.976437652631501
304. a	training program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there	is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards	and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely	at jobs in the local community.	6.019102548364887
305. if there is adequate information on job	opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere many more workers can be	expected to respond.	9.105654181468427
306. another problem is who will pay for the training.	10.394523248337816
307. local school districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic	about vocational training.	6.421632332635154
308. programs usually are expanded only	when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand	it.	7.032105024464237
309. even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support	for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it.	5.797532452103437
310. state	governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational	schools but their focus is still on area job opportunities.	7.6506071880084425
311. only	the federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and	nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower	needs.	7.792996899626661
312. if only state funds were used to pay for the vocational	education it could be argued that the state should not have to	bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in	other states.	10.367933526462098
313. however if federal funds are used it would be entirely	appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere	as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment.	6.48539357835391
314. such training	would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find	jobs in other localities.	9.205662875528139
315. a further possibility is suggested	by the example of the g i bills and also by some recent trends	in attitudes toward improving college education: that is to provide	financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local	facilities are inadequate.	5.460036246397947
316. this probably would require some support	for subsistence as well as for tuition but the total would be no	greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a youth	conservation corps.	7.675429495858721
317. a maximum of $600 per year per student would	enable many to take training away from home.	6.923526321492968
318. a program of financial	assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest	in training highly skilled labor.	9.91907292171144
319. instead of being limited to the poor	training facilities in remote areas the student would be able to	move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training.	6.191809541506003
320. such	specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly	growing industries where the equipment and job experience exist	and	where the future employment opportunities are located.	6.823307612024259
321. this would heighten	possibilities for part-time cooperative on-the-job and extension	training.	9.774596814044259
322. personal financial assistance would enable more	emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual.	10.587179626961042
323. his aptitudes	and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper	training.	6.352670641660905
324. but briefly the topping configuration must be examined for its	inferences.	10.422895192819478
325. then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had	further forecasting significance.	9.429982292559522
326. and then the application of the	count rules to the width of the configuration give us an	intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline.	8.749681059546296
327. the very idea	of their being count rules implies that there is some sort of proportion	to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and	the extent of the breakaway movement.	7.346821920906662
328. this expectation	is what really sold point and figure.	10.867675364171879
329. but there is no positive	and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense.	13.741100841700375
330. experience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply and	in fine these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations	and intensities of events.	7.1988137228760145
331. after all too much does not happen too	suddenly nor does very little take long.	7.321889212829819
332. the advantages and disadvantages	of these two types of charting bar charting and point and	figure charting remain the subject of fairly good natured litigation	among their respective professional advocates with both methods enjoying	in common one irrevocable merit.	6.340239890013639
333. they are both trend-following	methods.	16.67249252416214
334. even if we strip their respective claims to the barest minimum	the odds still favor them both for the trend in effect is	always	more likely to continue than to reverse.	7.296276724163929
335. of course many	more things are charted besides prices.	10.983520213806544
336. the foregoing have been methods	of charting prices but now let us look at some of the other indices	that are customarily charted and which are looked to for their forecasting	abilities.	8.207265050410127
337. the search for forecasting	formulae is ceaseless.	11.647719625067843
338. correlations have been worked up between	the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price.	7.573088559200683
339. the theory	behind this is of course fundamentalist in character.	9.11334529037023
340. as the number	of reported freight car loadings increased this was taken to indicate	increased industrial activity and consequently increased stock earnings	implying fatter dividends and implying therefore increased stock	market prices.	7.5604248182385145
341. we now know that things rarely ever work out in such	cut-and-dried fashion and that car loadings while perhaps interesting	enough are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn	before stock prices turn.	5.268257814628907
342. but the quest for such an index	goes on ceaselessly with all manner of investors and speculators participating	ranging from the sedate institutional type virtually to the	proverbial shoe-string operator all seeking doggedly studiously daily-	and often nightly- for the enchanting index that will foretell	the eternal secret: which way will the market move; up or down?	6.208221292396618
343. 	it recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of youth	a quest heavily invested in during the days of wooden ships.	5.525835323295882
344. just	as heavily invested are the endeavors of multitudes of modern men who	carry on the quest for the enchanting index.	6.765292791664436
345. much of this goes on in offices high up in wall street's lofty	wind-swept towers.	8.799700606863594
346. there sit men who make moving averages of	weekly volume monthly averages of price-earnings ratios ratios of	the number of advances to the number of declines ratios of an individual	stock's performance to overall market performance ratios of rising	price volume to falling price volume odd-lot indices and what not.	6.5329568239833335
347. they are concerned with all things traded in securities bonds cocao	coffee soybeans cotton tin oats etc.	7.130610841418014
348. and along	chicago's	west jackson boulevard la salle street and around the	merchandise mart plaza there sit men who chart crop reports who divide	the number of reported lady-bugs by the number of reported green-bugs	and the number of hogs by the amount of corn.	7.039949895619303
349. they plot the open	interest curves rainfall curves and they even divide democratic	congressmen by republican congressmen.	6.376876511860498
350. all these things and countless	more enter into their calculations and yet the enchanting index remains	non-forthcoming.	9.672559394096337
351. not at any rate in the fuller sense of the word.	10.41961614256415
352. the markets are far too subtle and the last word in these	endeavors will doubtless never be written for the enchanting index	is about as nebulous as the fountain of youth.	6.7869342764888
353. but whereas civilized	men no longer pursue the fountain they never abandoned their pursuit	of the enchanting index.	6.478669021782826
354. we mentioned odd-lot indices a	few paragraphs ago.	12.350455461918722
355. in the stock market the normal trading package	is a hundred shares just as 5000 bushels is the standard grain contract	package.	7.363529915575263
356. a stock transaction for less than a hundred shares is executed	via a special odd-lot broker on the floor of the exchange.	10.899283628510071
357. this	results in a separate record being made distinguishing these trades	from the overall volume of trading.	5.427950274147271
358. according to the theory underlying	odd-lot indices the trader who trades odd lots is most likely	a small trader one who can't afford to trade round lots.	7.525890903229159
359. or to	use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index enthusiast they represent	a sampling of the least sophisticated echelon of traders.	5.747675891275695
360. falling	most easily prey to an adverse market movement for this rank of traders	can least afford to lose virtually anything the odd-lot traders	do marketwise is taken to exemplify the wrong thing to do.	5.841774192096529
361. figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales	are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers.	6.04791021375758
362. odd-lot index observers then make graphs of the data according to their	particular statistical recipe.	7.315499381373
363. they might for example plot it exactly	as is or they might make ten day moving averages of it or longer	moving averages or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases	to odd-lot sales.	5.151054311774119
364. the particular recipe is a matter of individual	taste.	14.083858705166973
365. the data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price	chart usually of a popular stock average.	6.5934285901583936
366. towards the end of	an intermediate or major rise while the top is forming on the price	chart it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply.	5.996607848305864
367. this warns the chartist that the formation in progress is quite	likely to be a top.	6.881506374313357
368. similarly at the opposite end of the market cycle	towards the end of an intermediate or major decline usually while	the bottom is being formed on the price chart it is characteristic	that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again alerting the chartist	that a bottom is becoming a greater likelihood.	6.539445720418356
369. thus in the aggregate	the odd-lot trader is one who buys at the tops and sells at the	bottoms notwithstanding occasional individual exceptions.	6.675713120289759
370. while	it had long been known in general that the public is always wrong	the use of odd-lot indices now puts the adage on a statistical	basis.	6.884772243478044
371. one might well wonder why the public is always wrong	and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned	with the chicken and the egg.	6.666574571708565
372. which came first?	16.656679898684356
373.  is it really that	the public buys at the tops and not that the market tops out when	the public buys?	7.238285181774791
374.  and the converse at bottoms.	18.014471815902706
375. does the public	usually sell at bottoms or does the market usually bottom	out when the public sells?	7.466065862594832
376.    we have been using the word	public in quotation marks that is in its vernacular connotation	with reference to the odd-lot index theory.	10.599296140579101
377. obviously someone has	to sell in order for someone to buy and vice versa.	6.456554449617568
378. and while all concerned	are members of the literal public somewhat less than all concerned	although still a majority form the quotation marked public.	8.221542909854108
379. and the public minus the public leaves the so-called sophisticated	element- the element on the other end of the public's	transactions.	8.880868923355205
380. this element is often called strong	hands.	12.83916464908928
381. strong hands differ from weak hands in that their operations	are the primary movers.	5.739601853441883
382. they initiate campaigns so to speak	even if this initiation is diffused among them and their concerted action	only psychologically organized.	7.832937789961806
383. strong hands act; weak hands	react.	8.43480713758077
384. strong hands move first; weak hands ask what is going on?	8.419867058553036
385. 	when strong hands buy they are able to buy more and they do it even	in the face of bearish news reports.	6.309614669264672
386. they are able to sit more patiently	with what they have bought.	15.915680586605463
387. needless to say strong hands are	not eager to be joined by weak hands for this increases the risk that	they will have to absorb what these weak hands unload on the way up	at higher prices during the run-up phase of the campaign.	5.445008461773956
388. certain	badly disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel that there	is something somehow unfair dirty or even thoroughly criminal about	this interplay of competitive forces.	6.54618033837685
389. but after all can anyone imagine	a market wherein the reverse of these things were true?	7.87671515556022
390.  try to	imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose and	the majority would make consistent profits.	7.060411495153203
391. how much and how many profits	could a majority take out of the losses of a few?	8.22178944124042
392.    moreover	the taunt concerning the sophisticated echelon and its alleged	erudition is put to test during every campaign and accrues only	upon results; not before.	6.221143152558621
393. it quite often happens that campaigns go	askew resulting in a most unflattering deterioration of strong hands	into played-out hands just as a member of a former campaign's public	may emerge flatteringly right the next time.	6.194083601421998
394. membership	in the echelons fluctuates too.	10.472119682746735
395. the study of odd-lot indices	is somehow akin to the spectacle of a man trying to outfox his own shadow	what with all observers trying to get on the side of the few	at the same time.	9.078367714240208
396. the usefulness of this study and of configuration	analysis as well declines in direct proportion to the dissemination	of its use.	8.133535426154651
397. it has to by virtue of the very dictionary definition of	the word few.	13.770067478850558
398. diametric opposition must persist as to	the future course of prices if there is to persist a market at all.	8.438543613793158
399. and	the few must win what the many lose for the opposite arrangement	would not support markets as we know them at all and is in fact unimaginable.	6.459068959620058
400. there need be no squeamishness about admitting this.	13.901817684052416
401. anyone	still doubting that this is the only way markets can be is invited	to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently wins what	the minority loses.	6.724189709273033
402. mr john magee whose work has been discussed	in this chapter was quoted in a new yorker magazine profile	as saying- h of course you have to remember it's a good thing	for us chartists that there aren't more of us.	6.557999302866857
403. if you got too	many people investing by this method their operations would begin to	affect stock prices and thus throw the charts off.	6.525936975929947
404. the method would	become self-defeating.	17.638591467701175
405. mr alexander h wheelan's	study helps in point and figure technique tells the readers- we	assure you that the total number of people using this method of	market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating	in the securities and commodities markets.	5.331899125577266
406. what with	traders trading for so many different objectives and what with there	being so many unique and individualized market theories and trading	techniques in use and more coming into use all the time it is hard to	imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough	fans to invalidate itself.	6.987452068829289
407. nevertheless all theories and techniques	lead but to one of two possible modes of expression if they lead	to a market committment at all.	6.851743272883243
408. in the final analysis then the user	becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance notwithstanding	any amount of forethought and calculation however elaborate.	8.421820595988144
409. thus	while his theory or technique may not be oversubscribed it is commonplace	for bullish and bearish positions to become temporarily over-subscribed.	5.369386226541101
410. though the methods of deciding may be profound and diverse the	possible conclusions remain but two.	9.507926812550991
411. the purpose set forth at the beginning of this book	was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge	of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods already	in use so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself	the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that	is to follow and to appraise the forecast that its interpretation suggests	for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead.	5.43952840341129
412. in assessing the outlook for interest rates in 1961 the	question as always is the prospect for general business activity.	8.24710587069603
413. by	and large what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship	between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and	will thus determine interest rates.	5.244379598405574
414. moreover the trend of general business	activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal monetary	and other federal policies which affect interest rates.	7.531462277246944
415. nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business	activity.	6.6694398589597395
416. during much of the year the general level of business	activity has moved along on a record-high plateau but there have been	persistent signs of slack in the economy.	8.725150371275522
417. the tendency for general	business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident.	7.451621278813451
418. although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year	has thus far been quite modest it is hard to escape the conclusion	that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961	and possibly somewhat longer.	7.821415672237971
419. it is difficult to see any powerful	sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the	economy a new upward thrust.	8.75020937187674
420. the rate of plant and equipment spending	by business and industry now seems to be topping out and facing some	decline.	9.573802181444474
421. in earlier business cycles when this occurred the country usually	experienced a sharp upturn in residential construction as mortgage	financing became easier to obtain.	6.000282688333569
422. at this time however there are	signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with	the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction.	8.270766653029934
423. these signs are the inventories of unsold houses in some areas of	the country and the moderate rise in vacancy rates for apartments	.	6.244699261799836
424. on the other hand in a more favorable vein general	business activity should receive some stimulus from rising federal	spending and the reduction in business inventories has probably	run a good part of its course.	8.458842730812647
425. the 2% increase in retail sales in october	to a 4-month high is encouraging in this connection as well	as the most recent consumer survey by the national industrial conference	board which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans.	5.434321296452985
426. the pattern of general business activity which probably lies	ahead of us is a further moderate softening through the spring of 1961	before a new rise in economic activity gets under way.	7.496129545834734
427. the recovery	will probably be sparked by a rising rate of housing starts next spring	in response to more readily available mortgage credit as well as by	an expansion of government spending well sustained consumer spending	and some rebuilding of business inventories.	4.975946076298156
428. what does the general business outlook suggest about the trend	of long-term rates in 1961?	9.757317843788147
429.  it suggests that during the next several	months through the spring of 1961 the demand for long-term capital	funds may be moderately lower and that interest rates may tend to	move a little lower especially the rates on federal state and local	bonds as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds.	5.408762142994459
430. however	as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present as well	as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by voters the	over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high so that	any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great.	5.7067947172278215
431. it seems likely	moreover that with an increase in the rate of	saving in mortgage lending institutions interest rates on residential	mortgages may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year although	the increased ease in residential mortgage lending may occur primarily	in other terms than interest rate eg easier downpayment	and amortization terms.	5.580339947440587
432. if the trend of general business activity	follows the pattern suggested here we are likely to see additional	steps by the federal reserve authorities to ease the availability	of credit.	8.502918719811868
433. certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would	be a strong possibility as well as an easier reserve position for the	banking system.	6.092132771284809
434. however the monetary authorities will continue to	be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with	respect to our international balance of payments position and the outflow	of gold as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive	liquidity in the economy which would delay the effectiveness of	monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle.	7.485287906641234
435. one of the most intriguing questions is	whether the recent departures of the federal reserve authorities from	confining their open market operations to treasury bills will spread	into longer-term government securities in the next few months.	7.402659368120394
436. to	the extent that the new administration has its wishes the federal	reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire	maturity range of government securities and aggressively seek to force	down long-term interest rates.	6.452321895656389
437. the principle of bills only	or bills preferably seems so strongly accepted by the federal	reserve that it is difficult to envision conditions which would persuade	the authorities to depart radically from it by extending their open	market purchases regularly into long-term government securities.	5.792661700918284
438. however to the extent that the monetary authorities in their effort	to ease credit in the next several months conduct their open market	operations in longer-term government bonds they will certainly act to	accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result	of market forces.	6.381625829586266
439. by the end of the spring of 1961 assuming	that a general business recovery gets under way interest rates should	begin to edge upward again depending upon the vigor of the recovery	and the determination with which the monetary authorities move to	restrain credit availability.	6.34045141029453
440. my guess would be that interest rates will	decline moderately into the spring of 1961 and during the second half	of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during	the downturn.	6.930971193989854
441. it is pertinent to ask the question: has the	long upswing of interest rates during the past 15 years just about	run its course and are we now entering a period in which both capital	market forces and federal policies will produce a prolonged decline	of interest rates?	5.477701607027739
442.  my answer is in the negative because i believe	that total capital demands during the sixties will continue to press	against available supplies and interest rates will generally tend to	be firm at high levels.	6.7256118001885685
443. this view is based upon	several basic economic forces which i believe will be operating in	recent events in the general	assembly of the united nations confirm that the cold war will remain	with us and probably intensify for the foreseeable future.	6.094420265583059
444. this makes	it certain that federal expenditures for military preparedness and	foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several	years.	8.463292341995245
445. we are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the	friendship of the new african nations against the ruthless competition	of the communist bloc.	6.733054333342714
446. our efforts to overcome the lead of the	russians in space are bound to mean accelerated federal spending.	7.190743401679699
447. moreover	it is likely that federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster	rate of economic growth of the country to keep ahead of the communist	countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better	than theirs will lead to rising federal spending in certain areas	such as education housing medical aid and the like.	5.044728134389956
448. there are	serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising federal expenditures	of which i take a dim view but it seems very likely to occur.	8.337015751988256
449. during the sixties we have the prospect of a significant stepping	up in the rate of household formations which should contribute	to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building.	6.9996797657686125
450. according	to the latest	projections of the bureau of the census the annual	rate of household formations will increase for the next 20 years.	7.769677834544098
451. under	the most favorable assumptions for increase the bureau of the	census projects that the annual rate of household formations will rise	from about 883000 in the last two years of the fifties to an annual	rate of about 1018000 in the first five years of the sixties and	to a slightly higher annual rate of 1083000 in the second half of the	decade.	6.287100115120962
452. during the seventies the projections show a more pronounced	rise to an annual rate of 1338000 in the second half of that decade.	10.48537513600651
453. accordingly the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing	occasioned by the higher rate of household formation should enhance the	general economic prospects of the sixties.	5.058678593975553
454. however the impact of	a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated.	9.367180306331889
455. the average annual rate of 1083000 in the second half of the	sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of 1525000 in	with	the expansion of family formation in the sixties a continued substantial	rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems	to be indicated.	0.0
456. this is an area in which there is still a large backlog	of demand.	29.83503936838319
457. state and local expenditures increased	persistently from $26.	11.045118697824805
458. 5-billion in 1949 to $44.	10.472119682746735
459. 3-billion in 1959 and	it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this	decade which would carry them to the neighborhood of $75-billion	by 1970.	5.544515918176757
460. here would be a powerful force for raising business activity.	11.196526552036076
461. the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures	should continue to move upward from the levels of the fifties.	6.491403764578628
462. spurred	by keen competition in our industrial system and still further	increases in the funds devoted to industrial research plant and equipment	expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade.	6.261354008608648
463. i suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and housing	which was dammed-up during the thirties and world war 2 is finally	in the process of running dry.	6.396998882318591
464. there is some clear-cut evidence	of this.	29.657441313011308
465. for example the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans	for housing under the va home loan guaranty program seems to have	largely exhausted itself.	7.899503569053473
466. indeed the failure of home-building as a	whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage	financing and the increasing reports of pockets of unsold homes and	rising vacancy rates in apartment buildings may also signal in part	that the lush days of big backlog demand for housing are reaching an	end.	5.978533333968285
467. in a way we may be witnessing the same thing in the sales of automobiles	today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car	coming on the market but is more insistent on compact cars free of	the frills which were accepted in the fifties.	6.329886548599659
468. the huge backlog of demand	which was evident in the first decade and a half after the war	was fed by liquid assets accumulated by the public during the war and	even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and	home loan fields.	7.301164534361352
469. the consuming public has used up a good part of these	liquid assets or they have been drained by the rising price level	and we have apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer	or home mortgage terms easier.	6.265151968676248
470. this is not to say that the level	of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the sixties.	17.389249975965875
471. i	am confident that it will but consumer spending in the sixties will	not be fortified by the great backlog of wants and desires which characterized	most of the fifties.	0.0
472. markets should become more competitive	as consumers become more selective.	8.196044167676531
473. accordingly during the sixties our national economy is likely	to grow at as fast a rate as in the fifties and in the process to	require enormous amounts of capital funds.	6.7066642067806415
474. wage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of	forces- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases.	8.355571022862344
475. the purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which	has not been treated in the literature but which we believe makes a	significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few	very important industries.	5.109450006460001
476. while there may be several such industries	to which the model of this paper is applicable the authors make particular	claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages	and prices in the steel industry of the united states since world	war 2.	8.264657241765676
477. indeed the apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude	in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the	model here presented.	6.298799455806308
478. the model of this paper considers an industry	which is not characterized by vigorous price competition but	which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous	critical public scrutiny.	6.403496419865711
479. where the industry's product price	has been kept below the profit-maximizing and entry-limiting	prices due to fears of public reaction the profit seeking producers	have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands.	5.387003401415467
480. the contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition	and an exploration of some of its implications.	9.568470387705613
481. in order	to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force which we may call	the effect of public-limit pricing on key wage bargains	we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces	such as union power which may be relevant in an actual situation.	5.396800420302613
482. for	expository purposes this is best treated as a model which spells	out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the	public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence	of union pressures for higher wages.	5.898567685259947
483. part 1 below describes	this abstract model by spelling out its assumptions.	9.402241878138415
484. part 2	discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant	conclusions.	17.646198622485493
485. part 3 discusses the empirical relevance and policy	implications of the conclusions.	9.402241878138415
486. part 4 is a brief summary.	18.958301390356997
487. the	mathematical appendix presents the rigorous argument but is best read	after part 1 in order that the assumptions underlying the equations	may be explicit.	5.2588932223382265
488. the industry with which this model is concerned is a	basic industry producing a substantial share of gross national product.	7.680547411047537
489. for the purposes of setting the product	price the industry behaves as a single entity.	7.419583361482161
490. the demand	we are concerned with aggregate	demand for the industry's product.	10.132857641369208
491. the manner in which this is shared	among firms is taken as given.	8.391406901283968
492. in any given time period the aggregate	demand for the industry's product is determined by two things:	the price charged by the industry and the level of gnp.	8.284700927658132
493. for	the purposes of this discussion the problem of relative prices is encompassed	in these two variables since gnp includes other prices.	5.851710758842571
494. the form of	the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary	inversely with the product price and vary directly with the level of	gnp.	7.914375602143917
495. the industry of	this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected	with a public interest.	6.445889539651649
496. because of its importance and because the	lack of price competition is well recognized the industry is under considerable	public pressure not to raise its price any more than could	be justified by cost increases.	7.9186265889259735
497. the threat of effective anti-trust action	provoked by gouging the public through price increases not	justified by cost increases and fears of endangering relations with	customers congress the general public and the press all operate	to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases.	5.211515995650729
498. for the	industry of this model the effect of such public pressures in the	past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit-maximizing	price and even	below the entry-limited price.	7.882008790015473
499. for	such an industry it is only safe to raise its price if such an	increase is manifestly justified by rising costs	.	5.419285728287116
500. thus if public pressure sets the effective limit to	the price that the industry may charge this pressure is itself a function	of the wage rate.	7.278809401750381
501. in this model we abstract from all non-wage	sources of cost changes so that the public-limit price only	rises as the wage rate rises.	6.675706588318595
502. in such circumstances it may well be	to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage	rate.	11.601488072081608
503. since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises the	profit-maximizing price also rises when the public-limit price is elevated	and is likely to remain well above the latter.	5.436345134758126
504. the entry-limiting	price will also be raised for potential domestic competition but	unless general inflation permits profit margins to increase proportionately	throughout the economy we might expect the public-limit price	to approach the entry-limit price.	6.515077759849179
505. the foreign-entry-limit price would	be approached more rapidly since domestic wage-rates do not enter foreign	costs directly.	6.196120048044738
506. where this approach becomes critical the industry	can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its	sincerity in resisting the wage pressures of a powerful union	requesting	tariff relief after it has reluctantly acceded to the union	pressure.	6.856003628414112
507. whether or not it is in the industry's interest	to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent	to which the public-limit price rises in response to a basic wage	increase and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying	the wage increase.	6.519434087516143
508. the extent to which the public-limit price	is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a	function of three things: the passage of time the level of gnp	and the size of the wage increase.	9.57946891104516
509. we are abstracting from	the fact of strikes here but it should be obvious that the extent to	which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic	wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the	industry.	6.171101474222841
510. the industry may deliberately take a strike not to put pressure	on the union but in order to educate the government and	the customers of the industry.	7.363291223855055
511. as a strike continues these parties increase	their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement.	8.59397126627422
512. they become	increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry	claims the wage bargain would entail.	8.586863099314062
513. public indignation and	resistance to wage-price increases is obviously much less when the increases	are on the order of 3% per annum than when the increases are	on the order of 3% per month.	5.770461951725361
514. the simple passage of an additional	eleven months' time makes the second 3% boost more acceptable.	8.510875472925726
515. thus	the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage increase	the longer it has been since the previous price increase.	5.560711424636097
516. notice however	that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices	per se without an accompanying wage increase.	7.964328543437645
517. similarly higher	levels of gnp do not in themselves provide grounds for raising	prices but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that	it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase.	6.355777933746499
518. this is not	extended to anticipated levels of gnp however- only the current	level of gnp affects the public pressure against wage-price increases.	8.291928358643258
519. finally since the public requires some restraint on the part	of the companies larger wage increases call for less than proportionately	larger price increases	a price increase of 7% a wage increase of 10% allows a price	.	4.794951715532896
520. we	assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation	is constant with respect to quantity produced		and is the same for every firm.	7.175602276588529
521. the level of this average cost is determined by factor prices technology	and so forth.	7.413864179236019
522. as we have noted however we are abstracting	from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in	the wage rate.	9.210511820020196
523. the level of average cost is	e.	11.903366396315082
524. union policies and collective	the single union which faces the industry	does not restrict its membership and there is an adequate supply	of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate.	6.962842864600112
525. the union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter	of concern when setting its own wage policy- its concern with employment	makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain	full employment.	5.555803646439296
526. the union vigorously demands wage increases from	productivity increases and wage increases to offset cost-of-living	increases but we abstract from these forces here.	7.210955619203047
527. for our present	purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage	rate	and it is this basic wage rate which determines the	level of costs.	6.343945375272807
528. productivity is something of an amorphous concept and	the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even	well known to the industry much less to the union or to the public.	6.8484665797081865
529. disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the	problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a productivity	increase should be shared.	5.796116151346321
530. the existence of conflict and of	vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict	the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living	and productivity-share increases as distinct from a cost-raising increase	in the basic wage rate.	7.328733749567969
531. we assume further that the union	recognizes the possibility that price-level increases may offset wage-rate	increases and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price	increases arising from its own wage increases upon the real	wage rate.	5.465702329130352
532. for internal political reasons the union asks for	increases in the basic wage rate and would vigorously oppose	a reduction in this rate but the adjustment of the basic wage rate	upwards is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry.	6.776597605551481
533. changes in the basic wage rate are cost-raising and	they constitute an argument for raising prices.	6.174387796979883
534. however it is not known	to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase	is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate although the	companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude.	8.131445400735494
535. in this model then the industry is presumed to realize that	they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate but since	such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may	in circumstances to be spelled out in part 2 below find it to	their advantage to allow the wage rise.	5.529126206527752
536. thus for non-negative changes	in the basic wage rate the industry becomes the active wage-setter	since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason	of industry acquiescence.	6.748795274769756
537. the presumption in the literature would appear	to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case on	the grounds that it is clearly not in the interest of the industry	to raise wages gratuitously.	6.588114579360091
538. from this presumption it is an easy	step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate	must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed	in our model.	7.314295058018685
539. it is this conclusion that we challenge; we do	so by disproving the presumption on which it is based.	9.319725633419784
540. of the model	it is convenient to assume that the union-industry	contract is of one year's duration.	10.944772266895875
541. in the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international	law.	9.931625484358362
542. several factors contributed to this change.	11.107336869440822
543. the	congress of vienna is a convenient starting point because it both	epitomized and symbolized what was to follow.	5.236383152695367
544. here in 1815 the great	nations assembled to legislate not merely for europe but for the world.	10.59089513322992
545. thus the congress marks a formal recognition of the political system	that was central to world politics for a century.	7.076798287833172
546. international	law had to fit the conditions of europe and nothing that could not	fit this	system or the interests of the great european nations collectively	could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense.	7.649294764530398
547. essentially	this imposed two conditions: first international law had to recognize	and be compatible with an international political system in which	a number of states were competitive suspicious and opportunistic	in their political alignments with one another; second it had to	be compatible with the value system that they shared.	4.433462393909312
548. in both respects	international law was europeanized.	16.97769984606414
549. it was not always easy	to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions.	9.265494440764135
550. on the one hand the major european nations had to maintain vis-a-vis	each other an emphasis upon sovereignty independence formal equality-	thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of	action to maintain the flexibility of alignment that the system	required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous	napoleonic experience.	7.368190119787844
551. but there was no pressing need to maintain	these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world.	14.057053281171957
552. thus theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the	smaller european states did not really comfortably fit less developed	and less powerful societies elsewhere.	6.5712493751857
553. political interference in africa	and asia and even in latin america	by the special interest of the united states as expressed in	the monroe doctrine itself from the outset related to european politics	was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values	and the european balance itself.	6.141119012741397
554. a nation such as switzerland	could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect	its neutrality; more doubtful but possible	was the neutralization of the latin american countries;	out of the question was the neutralization of asia and africa.	6.45528978557147
555. this europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of	19th century scholars.	7.336738903232112
556. more emphasis was put upon the fact that international	law was the law of civilized nations; kent and story	the great early american scholars repeatedly made use of this phrase	or of christian nations which is a substantial equivalent.	8.09091364691852
557. wheaton stated that the public law was essentially limited to the	civilized and christian peoples of europe or to those of european	origin.	5.5870627374518325
558. of course it had always been of european origin in fact	but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory.	9.497917051732287
559. now with virtually every writer not only was the european origin	of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon but the rules	thus established by the advanced civilizations of europe were to be imposed	on others.	5.516751111784525
560. the european customs on which international law was	based were to become by force and fiat the customs that others were	to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states.	6.8287946646636275
561. hall for example was quite explicit on this point when he said	states outside european civilization must formally enter into the	circle of law-governed countries.	5.031061973382939
562. they must do something with the	acquiescence of the latter or some of them which amounts to an acceptance	of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction.	8.547440744412572
563. during the nineteenth century these views were protested by	virtually all the latin american writers though ineffectively just	as the new nations of africa and asia protest them with more effect	today.	6.633074813899798
564. a number of other nineteenth-century developments	contributed	to the transmutation of the law of nations into international	law; that is from aspects of a universal system of justice into	particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states.	8.96969692551629
565. the difference	is important for although the older law of nations did cover	relationships among sovereigns this was by no means its exclusive domain.	5.800747303873487
566. the law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to	their own citizens to foreigners and to each other in a conceptually	unified system.	10.579873523647176
567. the theory of international law which in the nineteenth	century became common to virtually all writers in europe and america	broke this unity and this universality.	6.413080507903362
568. it lost sight of the	individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise	of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice	or morality save as these values might affect international relations.	6.869095168730342
569. no longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine	what he ought to do; his search was merely for rules that might limit	his freedom of action.	5.806997634055077
570. to appreciate this development we	must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy.	8.985884733762152
571. first	and most obvious was the growing nationalism and the tendency to	regard the state and the individual's identification with the state	as transcending other ties of social solidarity.	5.662242888225814
572. national identification	was not new but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout	europe as new unifications occurred.	7.758550376765831
573. it reached its ultimate	philosophical statement in notions of state will put forward by	the germans especially by hegel although political philosophers will	recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of hobbes.	5.437096434310103
574. national	identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law theories which	incorporated this hegelian abstraction and saw law domestic and international	simply as its formal reflection.	6.290129093830134
575. in the international community	this reduced law to jellinek's auto-limitation.	10.466002073342645
576. a state the	highest form of human organization in fact and theory could be subjected	to law only by a manifestation of self-will or consent.	7.110216203716876
577. according	to the new theories the nineteenth century corporate sovereign	was sovereign in a quite new and different sense from his historical	predecessors.	6.598466918976268
578. he no longer sought to find the law; he made it;	he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be.	8.50328803992675
579. there was	no law domestic or international except that willed by acknowledged	by or consented to by states.	7.114600149770193
580. hidden behind hegelian abstractions	were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence.	7.615092762846159
581. related	to but distinguishable from nationalism was the growth of democracy	in one form or another.	6.2553469477383485
582. increased participation in politics and	the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic	effects upon law institutions.	6.54093796655646
583. the efforts of various interest groups	to control or influence governmental decisions particularly when	taken in conjunction with the impact of industralization led to a concentration	of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby	policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions.	5.736287051074467
584. law became a conscious process something more than simply	doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for	applicable norms.	6.559337496133126
585. particularly was this true when the norms previously	applied were no longer satisfactory to many when customs were rapidly	changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed.	5.491981963951048
586. the	old way of doing things which depended on a relatively stable community	with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations was no longer	adequate to the task.	6.09983039226678
587. first was the period of codification of existing	law: the code napoleon in france and the peculiar codification	that in fact resulted from austin's restatement and ordering of	the common law in england.	5.906828534379776
588. codification was followed in all countries	by a growing amount of legislation some changing and adjusting	the older law much dealing with entirely new situations.	6.157942065974489
589. the legislative	mills have been grinding ever since and when its cumbersome processes	were no longer adequate to the task a limited legislative authority	was delegated in one form or another to the executive.	4.908401855518352
590. whereas	the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice the	nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied	with law.	7.448313248280783
591. indeed with developed positivism the separation of law	from justice or from morality generally became quite specific.	5.8021300063904535
592. in municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as	fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power	of parliament- the elected representatives- at the expense of the	more conservative judiciary.	7.306761231795977
593. when the power of the latter was made	both limited and explicit- when norms were clarified and made more precise	and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary	hands- two purposes were served: government was made subservient	to an institutionalized popular will and law became a rational	system for implementing that will for serving conscious goals for embodying	the public policy.	5.440480453301142
594. it is true that initially the task	was to remove restrictions that it was thought inhibited the free	flow of money goods and labor; but even laissez-faire was a conscious	policy.	9.614481769026716
595. law was seen as an emanation of the sovereign will.	6.661604752959209
596. however the sovereign was not hobbes' absolute monarch but rather	the parliamentary sovereign of austin.	8.890041874635154
597. it was too an optimistic	philosophy and though it separated law from morality it was by no means	an immoral or amoral one.	7.01808663325341
598. man through democratic institutions	of government and economic freedom was master of his destiny.	8.582490004035838
599. the theory	did not require though it unfortunately might acquire a hegelian	mystique.	7.098087065137257
600. it was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions	of popular government.	12.325109250313941
601. it was not opposed to either justice	or morality; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials	who wielded public authority.	7.6621748616035825
602. particularly was this true as	laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of western society.	7.810415301301886
603. to free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising	bourgeoisie and this objective required that governmental authority-	administrative officials and judges- be limited as precisely	and explicitly as possible; that old customs which inhibited trade be	abrogated; that business be free from governmental supervision and	notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the	free market; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with	the new politics and the new economics be done away with.	4.452182971540685
604. contract-	conceived as the free bargain of formal equals- replaced the implied	obligations of a more static and status-conscious society.	7.233605218877253
605. indeed	contract was the dominant legal theme of the century the touchstone	of the free society.	6.873767108287194
606. government itself was based upon contract; business	organization- the corporation- was analyzed in contractual terms;	trade was based on freedom of contract and money was lent and	borrowed on contractual terms; even marriage and the family was seen	as a contractual arrangement.	6.363875850014182
607. it is not surprising that the international	obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract.	10.588561735085145
608. in	fact some- anzilotti is the principle example- went so far as	to say that all international law could be traced to the single legal	norm pacta sunt servanda.	6.9957381580628155
609. the displacement	of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth	and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international law	theory and doctrine.	5.780140237098333
610. in the first place the new doctrine brought	a	formal separation of international from municipal law rejecting the earlier	view that both were parts of a universal legal system.	8.808409683008206
611. one result	was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations.	9.620783781909985
612. admiralty law the law merchant and the host of problems which arise	in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country	were all severed from the older law of nations and made dependent	on the several national laws.	5.981212406117234
613. private international law	was thus segregated from international	law proper or as it is often called public international law.	6.885184906384749
614. states were free to enact within broad though determinate	limits their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their	courts to vary the law merchant and to enact legislation with regard	to many claims arising on the high seas.	6.285259729134857
615. the change was not quite	so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be	invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation	and then largely in marginal situations.	4.983969984190278
616. mr justice black was one of the minority that rested on the article	1 power.	11.318938631307228
617. in this view supported by only three members of the	court a power denied by the specific provisions of article 3	was granted by the generality of article 1.	6.596696470822481
618. if this seems arbitrary	its effect was to treat citizens of the district of columbia equally	with citizens of the states- at the expense of expanding a troublesome	jurisdiction.	8.649624649458028
619. for almost	a hundred years we relied upon state courts	for the protection of most rights arising under national	law.	6.062694230526357
620. then in 1875 apparently in response to the nationalizing	influence of the civil war congress first gave the lower federal courts	general authority- concurrently with state tribunals- to decide	cases involving federal-right questions.	8.091251517131603
621. one purpose of the change	was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the civil	war amendments against state interference.	6.4441271001144615
622. serious difficulty arose	with the advent of substantive due process.	8.843367331156275
623. an amendment presumably	designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves became	a laissez-faire limitation upon state economic policy.	6.9640844673372415
624. a flood	of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the processes of	local government.	8.40106343233402
625. congress reacted with a series of measures modifying	in various ways what it had granted in 1875.	6.2016166993573245
626. in 1910 it required the	convening of a special three-judge court for the issuance of certain	injunctions and allowed direct appeals to the supreme court.	8.160106390452345
627. such	legislation was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter.	7.795383746932392
628. in 1913 an abortive provision was made for the stay of federal injunction	proceedings upon institution of state court test cases.	8.482212948039292
629. the essential	ineffectiveness of these measures resulted in 1934 in substantial	elimination of federal jurisdiction to enjoin state public utility rate	orders.	5.670580783382225
630. three years later similar restraints were imposed upon injunctions	against collection of state taxes.	8.371670676500804
631. this saved for state adjudication	in the first instance the two major areas where federal injunctions	had been most obnoxious but other areas remained vulnerable.	5.736786668550141
632. meanwhile the supreme court like congress showed misgivings	concerning this aspect of government by injunction.	9.061818430428321
633. drawing upon	the traditional discretion of the chancellor mr justice holmes	introduced a series of self-imposed judicial restraints that culminated	in mr justice frankfurter's famous doctrine of abstention.	5.076847533455262
634. whereas the earlier cases turned rather narrowly upon the availability	of adequate state remedies the new emphasis is upon the nature of	the state policy at issue.	6.458755637005268
635. the classic case is railroad commission	v pullman.	9.377114209797627
636. the commission had issued an administrative order	which was challenged as discriminatory against negroes.	9.45273821686523
637. its enforcement	was enjoined by a federal trial court.	7.432382072063545
638. on review the supreme	court via mr justice frankfurter found southern racial problems	a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal courts ought	not to enter unless no alternative to h adjudication is open.	6.757773177684674
639. an alternative was found in the vagueness of state law as to whether	the offending order had in fact been authorized.	6.135225267642463
640. reluctant as usual	to interpret state legislation- such interpretation can only be	a forecast rather than a determination- mr justice frankfurter	led a unanimous court to vacate the injunction.	6.324432667118434
641. but it is crucial	that here unlike burford the trial court was ordered to retain	the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity	to settle the state-law question.	6.834754824926213
642. the resources of equity are equal	to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as	well as the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication.	6.830397971433521
643. temporary abstention ie postponement is one thing;	refusal to adjudicate is another.	6.002446559592496
644. to the extent that the jurisdictional	principle of 1875 stands unmodified by subsequent legislation federal	equitable relief against state action must be available- or so	it seems to mr justice frankfurter.	7.40347327650156
645. in alabama public service	commission v southern ry co the commission had	refused to permit abandonment of certain uneconomic train facilities.	6.012361463777105
646. the railroad claiming deprivation of property without due process	of law sought injunctive relief.	8.346523409839932
647. the court held that federal	jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state	be obstructed; this in the name of equitable discretion.	9.128661418672582
648. justices frankfurter and jackson concurred in the court's result	for they found no merit in the railroad's claim.	6.643215071337043
649. but they objected	vigorously to the proposition that federal courts may refuse to exercise	jurisdiction conferred in a valid act of congress:   by	one fell swoop the court now finds that congress indulged in needless	legislation in the acts of 1910 1913 1925 1934 and 1937.	4.948211519546795
650. by	these measures congress so the court in effect now decides gave	not only needless but inadequate relief since it now appears that	the federal courts have inherent power to sterilize the act of 1875 against	all proceedings challenging local regulation.	5.746588852777003
651. a most	revealing recent case is textile workers union v lincoln	mills.	7.190017756155806
652. the taft-hartley act gave the federal courts jurisdiction	over suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a	labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce.	6.605761073447593
653. on its face this merely provides a federal forum; it does	not establish any law for the federal judges to enforce.	5.84258359218675
654. how	can judges exercise jurisdiction to enforce national rights when congress	has created none?	7.391013650626644
655.  the court held that congress had intended	the federal judiciary to fashion an appropriate law of labor-management	contracts.	7.930088552995078
656. in short congressional power to grant federal-question	authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that congress	need not create or specify the right to be enforced.	7.729890560022165
657. the lincoln mills decision authorizes a whole new body of federal	common law which as mr justice frankfurter pointed out	in dissent leads to one of the following incongruities:	conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective	bargaining agreements; displacement of state law by federal law	in state courts h in all actions regarding collective bargaining agreements;	or exclusion of state court jurisdiction over these matters.	4.986091856538282
658. the justice's elaborate examination of the legislative history	of the provision in question suggests that congress' purpose	was merely to make unions suable.	6.955804554600195
659. with a few exceptions the lawmakers	seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction	involved- to say nothing of the delegation of lawmaking power to judges.	6.38148884954061
660. to avoid these constitutional difficulties mr justice frankfurter	was prepared to read the taft-hartley provision as concerned	with diversity rather than federal question jurisdiction.	7.526093915719312
661. this	would satisfy what presumably was congress' major purpose- the suability	of unions.	6.002446559592496
662. it would also leave intact the states' traditional	authority in the realm of contract law.	13.670035913708034
663. and york decisions require federal courts in diversity cases	here again mr justice frankfurter	could not lightly accept the principle of wholesale judicial	legislation.	5.998727237315507
664. if congress wants to displace the states from areas	which they have customarily occupied let it do so knowingly and explicitly.	7.547626412291326
665. and let it do its own lawmaking and not leave that to federal	judges.	7.195806614831201
666. does lincoln mills suggest that if congress granted jurisdiction	over interstate divorce cases the federal courts would be	authorized to fashion a national law for the dissolution of marriages?	7.009568153780609
667. 	there is a common problem behind most of these federal question	and diversity cases.	6.308942906593172
668. congress has not clearly defined the bounds	between state and federal court competence.	8.55795084636185
669. it has the power to do	so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on	a case-by-case basis.	9.768059765417965
670. a careful student has suggested that in any	new revision of the judicial code the legislators would do well	to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should	be limited to those matters in which their expertise in federal law	might be used leaving to the state judiciaries the primary obligation	of pronouncing state law.	6.1626295077968525
671. obviously the goal here proposed is the	guiding principle in mr justice frankfurter's opinions- to	the extent that congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion.	5.439876757492909
672. the same rule of specialization and division of labor guides him in	the fela certiorari cases in the administrative law area	and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review.	7.471042682756322
673. mr justice black	no doubt concurs in principle but is more apt to make exceptions to	achieve a generous and just result.	5.475825608292139
674. he will not be fooled	by technicalities.	22.184678737871383
675. with few	exceptions congress has not given federal courts exclusive authority	to enforce rights arising under federal law.	6.21477470017956
676. to put it differently	state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with respect	to most claims of federal right.	9.318478032457165
677. to insure uniformity in the meaning	of national law however state interpretations are subject to supreme	court review.	6.093144786683763
678. it may be noted parenthetically that to evade	desegregation	an ex-justice and former southern governor has urged	congress to abolish this reviewing authority.	9.768417744115498
679. the result of course	would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in	different states.	8.53640913803731
680. it would also probably mean different things within	the same state- depending upon what court rendered	decision.	11.022160136999576
681. we consider here only a few of many problems involved	in this crucial federal-state relationship.	8.937712413973937
682. the first is that enforcement	of national law in state litigation raises in reverse the old	diversity puzzle of the relation of procedure to substance.	7.427227232736106
683. subject to	certain constitutional restraints in favor of fair trials each level	of government is free to devise its own judicial procedures.	5.688768559615062
684. litigants	who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that	court subject to its rules of procedure.	6.703888492474915
685. a similar canon applies to those	who press state claims in federal tribunals eg in diversity	cases.	6.20469847978654
686. in an fela	controversy the state court followed established state procedure	by construing a vague complaint most strongly against the complainant.	8.144935308854754
687. in other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon	the pleader by state law.	10.806022916250093
688. the result was that the plaintiff's case	was dismissed.	17.557469861921223
689. mr justice black led a reversing majority: strict	local rules of pleading cannot be used to impose unnecessary burdens	upon rights of recovery authorized by federal law.	5.50077428060064
690. here as	in the byrd case another element of state procedure was subsumed	to federal judge-made law.	8.168656102496268
691. justices frankfurter and jackson dissented:	one state may cherish formalities more than another one	state may be more responsive than another to procedural reforms.	4.903693293796623
692. if	a litigant chooses to enforce a federal right in a state court he	cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are plaintiffs who	press like claims arising under state law with regard to the form	in which the claim must be stated- the particularity for instance	with which a cause of action must be described.	6.0787118207407165
693. federal law though invoked	in a state court delimits the federal claim- defines what	gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove it.	5.321182526784233
694. but the form in	which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the state	exacts in the enforcement of like obligations created by it so long	as a requirement does not add to or diminish the right as defined	by federal law nor burden the realization of this right in the actualities	of litigation.	6.640919829430761
695. another problem in the area of federal-state	relationships is this: what constitutes reversible error in	a state decision?	7.618675711827995
696.  terminiello v chicago involved a conviction	for disorderly conduct under a local ordinance.	7.391013650626644
697. the conduct	in question was a speech.	9.802060557618772
698. the accused did not object to the trial court's	charge to the jury that discourse may constitute a breach of	the peace if it stirs the public to anger invites dispute brings about	a condition of unrest h.	6.678516632233705
699. for present purposes it may be assumed	that this charge so narrowly limited speech as to violate the federal	constitution.	6.650938479010989
700. though the accused raised many other objections he	did not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings.	7.621359693134935
701. that is he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his	case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal right.	7.581696088016995
702. how else can one explain for example allowing the survival of the right	to amortize bond discount and premium but not	the right to amortize bond issue expenses; or allowing a deduction	for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization	but not a deduction for theft losses	sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered	after it; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depeciation	but not allowing rapid amortization of	emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization; or allowing survival	of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company	381 but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes?	5.430461447675593
703. 	these items and most of the others listed above seem	quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section	381.	6.634885315513075
704. there does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction	either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of	tax-avoidance possibilities.	14.753173423342616
705. with respect to items such as these the	provisions of section 381 viewed in historical perspective suggest	a rule requiring survival whether the items are beneficial or detrimental	to the surviving corporation.	5.559283008340014
706. to this extent some stretching	of the literal meaning of the committee report seems justified since	the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication if not the	language of the statute.	7.652542745764144
707. it is not contended that section	381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes.	11.727342546857113
708. such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction	of the statute alone; it would certainly violate the intention of	congress as expressed in the committee report; and in at least	one instance involving refund claims it might be contrary to another	provision of the united states code.	8.522585692541186
709. section	203 of the united states code voids an assignment of a claim against	the government unless made after it has been allowed the amount due	has been ascertained and a warrant for its payment has been issued.	5.642704308197593
710. if it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions this	section would prohibit a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for	taxes paid by a transferor corporation even though the reorganization	meets the requirements of section 381.	7.498761370764141
711. a clearly recognized	exception is a statutory merger or consolidation.	7.563545188002981
712. the leading case	seaboard air line railway v united states held that	the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor	and it has been consistently followed.	7.138324771884965
713. the court said the purpose	of the section was principally to spare the government the embarrassment	and trouble of dealing with several parties one of them a stranger	to the claim and to prevent traffic in claims particularly tenuous	claims against the government.	5.5722779872812565
714. neither reason said the court applied	to the case at hand; furthermore congress could not be presumed	to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states.	7.262193183316376
715. other	exceptions are assignments for the benefit of creditors corporate dissolutions	transfers by descent or transfers by subrogation.	6.441787998303965
716. exceptions	are often classified as transfers by operation of law.	8.196044167676531
717. a tax-free reorganization not complying with the merger or consolidation	statutes of the states involved is difficult to fit into an operation	of law mold.	6.428042594137934
718. although it is in some ways comparable to	a voluntary sale of assets for cash to which section 203 quite clearly	applies the courts and treasury have held that acquiring corporations	in several types of non-taxable reorganizations may sue for refund	of taxes paid by transferors.	7.1967541645501045
719. a recent case in point is mitchell	canneries v united states in which a claim against the government	was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership whose	partners were former stockholders and then to another corporation formed	by the partners.	0.0
720. holding the final corporation entitled to sue on	the claim the court cited the seaboard novo trading and roomberg	cases for the proposition that h transfers by operation	of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not	assignments prohibited by the statute.	5.757453938655412
721. in an earlier case	kingan + co v united states an american corporation	was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a british corporation	in exchange for its own stock and then liquidating the british	corporation.	5.968420493411964
722. the anti-assignment statute was held not to prevent the	american corporation from suing for a refund of taxes paid by the british	corporation.	7.500466656432886
723. the transaction presumably would have qualified under	section 368 as a contractual reorganization followed	by a section 332 liquidation but not under section 368	as a statutory merger of consolidation.	5.086785850344256
724. the court nevertheless relied	on the seaboard case and also mentioned that the shareholders	of the two corporations were the same.	7.710501149062964
725. in substance said the court	there was no transfer of equitable title.	7.8924097041785695
726. the treasury arrives	at substantially the same conclusion but skirts the problem of section	203 of the united states code.	12.00857468294896
727. revenue ruling 54-17 provides	that if the corporation against which a tax was assessed has since been	liquidated by merger with a successor corporation a claim for refund	should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the	corporation which paid the tax followed by the name of the successor	corporation.	5.483503900639054
728. proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also	be filed.	8.574928159153368
729. if the succession is a matter of public record certificates	of the secretaries of state or other public officials having custody	of the documents will suffice; if the succession is not of record	all documents relating to such succession properly certified are	required.	5.583164282154521
730. the former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger	or consolidation the latter to a contractual acquisition.	8.185228423961119
731. the ruling	would not however apply to an acquisition of assets for cash.	6.817408452020724
732. a recent	ruling although rather confusing cites and follows rev rul	54-17.	9.12172255696927
733. the ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory	or contractual reorganization.	6.88426636131984
734. hence a successor corporation	in a c reorganization appears entitled to sue for a refund of taxes	paid by the merged corporation despite section 203.	6.8750612108477425
735. in a b	reorganization followed by a section 332 liquidation those cases	which hold that section 203 is inapplicable to transfers in liquidation	appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of taxes	paid by the transferor.	5.534405781745756
736. in fact a cash purchase of a corporation's	stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer	a claim for refund if the kimbell-diamond doctrine is not	applied to eliminate the intermediate step.	7.081106674528976
737. as stated in seaboard and numerous other cases the two	primary reasons for the enactment of section 203 of the united states	code were to prevent the government from having to deal with more	than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claims	on a contingent-fee basis.	6.198766535614133
738. the cases have allowed transfer of claims	if beneficial ownership is not changed.	8.988549970243525
739. the first reason would never	apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section	381 which is the only type presently under discussion.	6.84324716232423
740. section	381 applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a subsidiary	owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent a statutory merger or consolidation	an acquisition of substantially all a corporation's assets	solely in exchange for voting stock or a change of identity form	or place of organization.	6.7160766240447245
741. in virtually every case the transferor corporation	is liquidated and its former stockholders either own outright	or have a continuing stock interest in the assets which gave rise	to the tax.	5.623288987766043
742. in these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting	claims is exceedingly remote.	11.398853737876168
743. furthermore in a c reorganization	the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation	which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger	to which the statute is clearly inapplicable.	4.922682199475459
744. nor is it	at all likely that a desperate claim against the government will	be assigned on a contingent-fee basis in the guise of a tax-free reorganization.	7.022035670826433
745. if the transferor has substantial assets other than the	claim it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to	acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim	for refund of taxes.	6.175078871902545
746. if such an unlikely transaction were to take place	it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase followed	by the prosecution of the claim by the wholly-owned subsidiary followed	by liquidation.	7.059689915203386
747. in the rare case where a corporation's only	substantial asset or its most important one is a claim for refund perhaps	its transfer should not be permitted whether the reorganization	takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets	for stock.	6.127724970658562
748. it appears then that although the matter is not	dealt with in section 381 a successor corporation in a reorganization	of a type specified in section 381 is entitled to sue for refund	of taxes paid by a transferor corporation.	7.584985073860341
749. section 203 of the united	states code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against	the government transferred in tax-free reorganizations.	5.26078977701207
750. the successor	corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims.	9.439803099895592
751. tax attributes of the transferor	there are certain tax attributes	of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts	of the particular reorganization involved.	5.365079544176685
752. for example property used	in the trade or business of a transferor corporation as defined	in section 1231 presumably would not retain its special status following	a non-taxable reorganization if it is not so used in the business	of the acquiring corporation.	8.056897812416711
753. the parent of a group filing consolidated	returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization	defined in section 368 but as a different corporation	for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation	which had not for example elected to file consolidated returns	with its own subsidiaries.	4.878634395791597
754. similar considerations presumably made	it difficult to prescribe a general rule where the acquired and acquiring	corporations have different methods of accounting	or depreciation.	6.551339090505491
755. other sections	of the 1954 internal revenue code provide for survival of certain of	a transferor's tax attributes following a tax-free reorganization.	5.280011632582226
756. section 362 requires carryover of the transferor corporation's basis	for property transferred and section 1223 provides for tacking on	the transferor's holding period for such property to that of the transferee.	6.943969103411335
757. section 169 permits a person acquiring grain-storage facilities	to elect to continue amortization over a 60-month period.	5.456921094434593
758. however	a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section 168 for	attributes similar to a loss	there may be certain items which are quite similar	to a net operating loss carryover or operating deficit and whose right	to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions	applicable to those items.	5.534995139681203
759. for example suppose another excess profits	tax similar to prior laws is enacted providing for carryover of	excess profits credits.	6.7758693690835
760. this carryover right has a number of things in	common with a net operating loss carryover.	9.765064975238827
761. it is an averaging device	intended to ease the tax burden of fluctuating income; it is a tax	benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expects	to have a high excess profits tax.	6.961470608139972
762. under the 1939 code this item	was permitted to survive a tax-free reorganization in the stanton	brewery case but only over the dissent of judge learned hand	who wrote the majority opinion in the sansome case a leading case	requiring carryover of earnings and profits in a non-taxable reorganization.	6.032286788469066
763. since this type of item was not in the statute when	section 381 was enacted in 1954 one cannot say with certainty what effect	the enactment of that section should have.	6.080643184489887
764. with respect to this	type of item one might properly apply the language of the committee	report quoted above which cautions against using section 381 as a	basis for treating other tax attributes not mentioned therein.	7.234953563956535
765. actually there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable	to a net operating loss carryover.	6.965778513435225
766. probably the primary reason	for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique	opportunity it presents for tax avoidance.	7.5340394207877655
767. there were two	methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the	resources available: interviews in depth with a few selected	companies and the more limited interrogation of a large number of	companies by means of a mail questionnaire.	8.253737241627519
768. while the method	of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the	opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and	circumstances of a company's practices and opinions it also involved	the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems	of just a few individual companies.	6.424744312601869
769. as a result it was decided that	a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more	effective in determining the general practices and opinions of	small	firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems	of defense procurement that concern both industry and government.	7.223953997092721
770. it was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest	fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more	detailed nature.	9.703149147297152
771. it is recognized that a mail questionnaire	has inherent limitations.	15.059863694715913
772. there is the danger that the questions will	mean different things to different respondents.	15.195843488785012
773. simple yes or	no answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the	various respondents may have.	5.236383152695367
774. a respondent may want to make alternative	answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed	in the question.	10.562918354367518
775. there is also the problem of the respondent's frame	of reference.	17.863316882716227
776. is the respondent making a recommendation for his own	benefit for the benefit of his industry for the benefit of a specific	government department or service for the benefit of the defense	program for the benefit of small business or for the benefit of the	taxpayers?	10.565841707775201
777.    there is also the question of whether the respondent	based his answers on factual information and carefully considered	judgment or whether his answers were casual guesses.	8.452075412352073
778. finally there	is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is held- whether	it is a firm opinion or one that the respondent favors only slightly	over the alternatives.	6.809880297573636
779. the research team was very mindful of	these dangers and limitations of a mail questionnaire.	7.15388948075286
780. under the circumstances	however the team considered it would provide the most useful	information at this point.	8.879663939865784
781. in the preparation of the questionnaire	the problems noted above were carefully considered and the structure	and phraseology used were designed to minimize the effects of these	limitations.	6.907676503538704
782. the questionnaire was	designed to elicit three types of information: the facts regarding	certain characteristics of the respondents including their experience	with and interest in securing defense business; the actual	selling and buying practices of the respondents; and the attitudes	and opinions of the respondents concerning bidding procedures and	the methods of awarding defense contracts.	5.776892081063983
783. it was hoped that the facts	concerning the characteristics and practices of the respondents would	offer clues to the reasons why they took the positions and made the	recommendations which they did.	6.225728200058096
784. the major sections of the questionnaire	are devoted to the following:	information for classifying respondents	characteristics of defense sales activities	respondents' practices in participating	in advertised bidding for defense business	respondents' practices in participating in	negotiated bidding for defense purposes	respondents' opinions regarding advertised bidding	respondents' opinions regarding	negotiated bidding	respondents' preferences regarding the methods of awarding defense	contracts   the questionnaire	provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification	of the respondent was optional.	6.305925741288328
785. the questionnaire also stated	that in any event all replies would be treated confidentially.	7.447004472385779
786. it is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the	questionnaire identified themselves.	16.91153336519083
787. the questionnaire	the research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire	over a period of six months.	6.839756460544422
788. in june 1960 an early draft	of the questionnaire along with a cover letter was mailed to fourteen	companies in the state of washington.	9.5893335865743
789. several days after the companies	had received the questionnaire members of the research team contacted	the presidents of eleven of these companies in person or by phone	to discuss any ambiguities or difficulties the addressees might have	experienced in completing the questionnaire.	5.256113899212793
790. this test resulted in	further revisions of the questionnaire.	11.814400607264279
791. the research team was	concerned that responses from firms in the state of washington might	not be typical of those throughout the country or that the results might	be different when no phone or personal follow-up was made.	5.683351152834546
792. accordingly	another test of the questionaire was made.	9.924684914768017
793. the revised draft	was mailed in july 1960 to 100 firms throughout the united states.	6.427949924727989
794. fifty of the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from 3500 names	submitted by member companies of the aerospace industries association	and fifty were selected in a similar manner from	a list of 1500 names compiled by the research team from the thomas	register.	6.276833382497373
795. the method of compiling the aia and	tr lists will be described later.	8.457169416997049
796. ten days after the questionnaires	were mailed follow-up airmail postcards were sent urging	those companies which had not yet returned their questionnaires to do	so at once.	7.243544023981133
797. twenty-eight returns in all were received.	7.622507342753323
798. the responses	were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions	that were apparently not understood by the respondent.	7.373312151862096
799. the cover	letter questionnaire and follow-up postcard were then revised into	final form	of mailing lists	the objective of the study was to determine the	opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs.	4.948504412373319
800. the	firms to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective	in mind.	8.54612616210626
801. three lists of companies were made and used in the	study.	6.860261309434493
802. the first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies	located in the state of washington which were personally known to	the research team to be active in defense work.	9.262072811263138
803. the primary consideration	in the compilation of this list was convenience in discussing the	questionnaire with company officers.	6.229494865611091
804. the second list was derived	from a group of approximately 8000 names supplied to the research	team by the aerospace industries association.	8.158622531805037
805. these names were secured	from member companies by the association from the forty-four sources	listed in appendix f.	6.563557301591768
806. each source selected from its approved	bidders list about 200 firms which it believed to be small businesses	that participated in the production of weapons and weapon support systems.	7.61028224925057
807. where possible the name of an executive was supplied along with	the company name and address.	6.783254518102284
808. the forty-four lists supplied	by the aia member companies were merged and duplicate names were	eliminated.	8.086542342015262
809. there was further elimination of all companies that were	not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive.	10.02397722600672
810. the	remaining names were then checked against the thomas register list	and duplicate names were removed from the aia lists.	7.104730996997934
811. by these steps the final aia list was reduced from 8000 to 3500.	6.3755586977207015
812. the third list was selected by the research team on a random	basis from the thomas register.	8.757421584114246
813. it was compiled as a control sample	to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the	lists	submitted by the members of the aerospace industries association	were materially different from those of other small firms selling to defense	programs.	7.184200545339284
814. such a difference might have resulted from:	the fact that the aerospace industries association members whose	lists were used did not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs.	7.26705123501818
815. the fact that companies on the aia lists were already	participating in the defense program because of the manner of their	selection.	8.888080866931421
816. accordingly as in-group they might have different	opinions	and practices than an out-group composed of those companies	not so participating but interested in defense business.	6.5710356015636435
817. the fact that aia lists might not have been selected on a random	basis.	11.4684985267224
818. the control sample was selected by taking the bottom	name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the alphabetical	listing of manufacturers in the thomas register.	7.047356150136758
819. if the bottom	name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified	the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was	substituted.	7.272045395288467
820. fifteen hundred names were selected in this fashion.	9.538254989242564
821. mailing the questionnaire	each questionnaire was mailed with a	cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive	of each firm.	5.399049522604094
822. the questionnaires were mailed in seattle washington	and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of idaho montana	oregon and washington.	7.993676812918697
823. airmail was used for the addresses outside	the pacific northwest.	8.680340325235223
824. each letter contained a postage-prepaid	return envelope by regular mail for addresses in the pacific	northwest and by airmail for those outside the pacific northwest.	6.559894907864099
825. approximately ten days after the questionnaire was mailed a	follow-up	airmail postcard was sent to each of the original names.	6.834648817376402
826. the	first test mailing was made in june 1960.	11.37892951050938
827. the second	test mailing was made in july 1960.	10.065313461484436
828. the final	mailing of the questionnaire was made late in august 1960 to 4900	firms consisting of 3450 from the aia list and 1450 from the	tr list.	6.593952525060604
829. returns received	over 1000 returns were received	within two weeks after the final mailing was made.	5.616354153675394
830. they continued	to arrive until the end of december 1960 by which time a total of	1343 returns were received representing 26.	8.392403624382913
831. 8 per cent of the 5014	questionnaires	sent out.	20.36367234640105
832. fifty-seven returns could not be used because	they were incomplete or received too late to be processed.	7.755142236734654
833. the remaining	1286 returns that were processed came from the categories in table	2.	7.638222000087766
834. each questionnaire was audited	for obvious mistakes and for comments and was identified by a serial	number by the source list from which the company name was selected	and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the postmark	on the return envelope.	6.600118210882239
835. all responses except comments were	numerically coded to permit use of data-processing equipment.	6.8100295407073
836. the codes	were key-punched	into ibm punch cards and verified.	10.582206877639416
837. each return	required three cards and involved key punching 228 digital columns.	6.726027084384736
838. in order to be able to properly relate the data for a single company	each of the three cards comprising the set for each firm was identified	with the appropriate serial number of the respondent.	9.216792185500433
839. the cards were	then processed using standard ibm punch card equipment including	an ibm 650 computer.	6.374057384651866
840. the first step in processing was	to analyze the returns from questions 1 2 and 3 to determine	whether the respondents were large businesses or small businesses in	accordance with the definitions contained in aspr section 1-701.	7.194966094567295
841. the results are shown in table 3.	10.90212423231241
842. the returns from companies classified as large businesses were set aside	and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions	and practices of small firms.	7.677450945120173
843. the second step in processing	was to compare the responses from companies on the aia list with	those from companies on the tr list in order to determine whether	it would be appropriate to merge the responses for the purposes of	the study.	5.232061254614165
844. the methods and results of this comparative analysis are	described in appendix h.	9.067595429414526
845. it was concluded that it would be appropriate	to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all	small businesses engaged in or wishing to sell to defense programs.	7.035277132077582
846. in the first place the two groups of firms when combined had characteristics	and practices that were more representative of companies	that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the aia	list alone.	8.18028471635713
847. the vast central valley of california is one of the most	productive agricultural areas in the world.	8.34274690420831
848. during the summer of 1960	it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle.	11.343015132391393
849. the contestants in this economic struggle are the agricultural	workers organizing committee of the afl-cio	and the agricultural employers of the state.	5.809607547793546
850. by virtue of	the legal responsibilities of the department of employment in the	farm placement program we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between	these two forces.	9.394732976370623
851. it is not a pleasant or easy position but one	we have endeavored to maintain.	11.168281659199216
852. we have sought to be strictly neutral	as between the parties but at the same time we have been required	frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose.	9.857649597648038
853. inevitably one side was pleased and the other displeased regardless	of how we ruled.	6.60424116319818
854. often the displeased parties interpreted our decision	as implying favoritism toward the other.	8.47193481424953
855. we have consoled ourselves	with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one	of the consequences of any decision in an adversary proceeding.	8.081065687929836
856. it	is disconcerting nevertheless to read in a labor weekly perluss	knuckles down to growers and then to be confronted with a growers'	publication which states perluss recognizes obviously phony and	trumped-up strikes as bona fide.	6.514631564022131
857. for a number of years	there have been sporadic attempts in california to organize farm workers.	9.251525457015324
858. these attempts met with little sucess for a variety of reasons.	9.665391441256943
859. they were inadequately financed without experienced leadership and	lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole.	6.749079213941157
860. this past	year the pattern has been different: the organizing program had the	full support of the afl-cio which supplied staff and money	to the awoc as well as moral support.	7.465787803596465
861. leadership was experienced	and skillful and financial resources were significant.	6.460370037324521
862. regardless	of where personal sympathies may lie as between the parties failure	to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts	of life.	6.723339753771885
863. as a result of these changed conditions the impact	of the organizational effort on agricultural labor-management relations	has been much greater than in the past.	8.277936850588098
864. the awoc has been able	to employ the traditional weapons of labor- the strike and the	picket	line- with considerable success particularly in the area of wages.	7.665853002647101
865. by the very nature of the situation it is the union which	has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management.	8.058587436719753
866. to date at least the strategy of the awoc has been	selective; that is to say to concentrate on a particular crop or activity	in a particular area at a strategic time rather than any broadside	engagement with management throughout an area or the state.	7.207160569149256
867. primarily we became involved in these disputes because of our referral	obligations under our farm placement program.	5.326519577128725
868. normally because	agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance we would	not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade	dispute provision of the unemployment insurance code although	such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility.	6.100526369167851
869. but the current	issues arose out of the wagner-peyser act concerning referrals	to an establishment where a labor dispute exists and out of public	law 78 and the migrant labor agreement if mexican nationals were	employed at the ranch.	5.942045425290292
870. most of us remember and think of the wagner-peyser	act in its historical sense as a major milestone in the	development of public placement services.	9.285243180456082
871. infrequently do we think	of it as a living continuing operating control over the system.	6.352983581404954
872. however	when labor disputes arise its provisions come clearly into play.	7.879513779734377
873. california has accepted the provisions of that act	by enacting into our code a provision that	the state of california accepts the provisions of the	wagner-peyser act h and will observe and comply with the requirements	of that act.	4.506734639447049
874. with respect to labor disputes the wagner-peyser	act states only   in carrying out the provisions	of this act the secretary is authorized and directed to provide for	the giving of notice of strikes or lock-outs to applicants before they	are referred to employment.	6.629365664168166
875. other provisions of the act empower	the secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its provisions	and he has done so.	6.049512904794806
876. the pertinent regulation for our purposes	is section 602.	10.582206877639416
877. 2 as follows:   referrals in labor	dispute situations.	9.148655398712318
878. no person shall be referred to a position the	filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which	is vacant because the former occupant is on strike or is being locked	out in the course of a labor dispute or the filling of which	is an issue in a labor dispute.	6.667599842844862
879. with respect to positions not covered	by subparagraph of this paragraph any individual may be	referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists provided	he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time	of his referral.	5.392521482661337
880. in analyzing this regulation let us take	the last sentence first.	10.680886366150174
881. it permits referrals under certain circumstances	even when there is a labor dispute provided the individual is	given written notice of such a dispute.	7.281563596698024
882. assume for example a situation	where a farm has a packing shed and fields.	7.8854260369698626
883. the packing shed workers	go on strike.	9.802060557618772
884. there is no dispute involving fieldwork.	31.247677617749154
885. we concluded	that we may refer workers to the fieldwork	provided we give them written notice of the packing shed dispute.	6.157602370458302
886. so far no troublesome cases have arisen under this provision.	12.07111099429687
887. it is the first part of the regulation that is currently at issue.	14.435980485479014
888. note that it prohibits referrals under either condition	or condition.	9.89936252589347
889. employer representatives have contended that the secretary	has gone beyond his authority by such a prohibition on the	grounds that the wagner-peyser act requires only written notice to	the prospective worker that a dispute exists.	4.5421746389230675
890. the matter	got into the courts this way: one of the early strikes called	by the awoc was at the digiorgio pear orchards in yuba county.	8.27132987741457
891. we found that a labor dispute existed and that the workers had left	their jobs which were then vacant because of the dispute.	7.42388720933535
892. accordingly	under clause of the secretary's regulation we suspended	referrals to the employer.	7.615092762846159
893. the employer seeking to continue his harvest challenged	our right to cease referrals to him and sought relief in the superior	court of yuba county.	5.707979950475336
894. the court issued a temporary restraining	order directing us to resume referrals.	10.015072012940244
895. we of course obeyed the court	order.	10.717432709549398
896. however the attorney general of california at the request	of the secretary of labor sought to have the jurisdiction over	the issue removed to the federal district court on grounds that	it was predominantly a federal issue since the validity of the secretary's	regulation was being challenged.	8.006703027421517
897. however the federal court	held that since the state had accepted the provisions of the wagner-peyser	act into its own code and presumably therefore also the	regulations it was now a state matter.	5.20300760161347
898. it accordingly refused to assume	jurisdiction whereupon the california superior court made the	restraining order permanent.	9.459368085401477
899. under that order we have continued referring	workers to the ranch.	7.609953496595128
900. a similar case arose at the bowers ranch	in butte county and the superior court of that county issued similar	restraining orders.	7.350730863883087
901. the growers have strenuously argued	that i should have accepted the superior court decisions as conclusive	and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision	in the secretary's regulation.	5.037374730288671
902. i cannot accept that view	either as a lawyer or as an administrator.	10.530755366033473
903. first let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved.	8.724519088073281
904. it is an accepted juridical principle in california that a superior	court decision does not constitute a binding legal precedent.	10.000235435545846
905. it	is conclusive unless appealed only upon the particular parties to	the particular action which was heard.	5.917806687549367
906. it is not binding upon another	superior court which could rule to the contrary.	13.711587323548112
907. only when a decision	is rendered by the district court of appeal	is a binding precedent established.	6.173037007079485
908. in that event	we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative interpretation	of the matter and one which we can follow statewide with confidence	that the policy will not be overthrown in other superior courts.	7.751317274788524
909. but over and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent	decision i am convinced that the decisions of the superior courts	which in effect nullify the secretary's regulation are not a	correct interpretation of the secretary's power under the federal	law.	5.6882979937125135
910. i believe i am in good company in this view.	12.027581026306956
911. the attorney general	of california concurs in this interpretation and has filed an appeal	from these decisions to the district court of appeal.	5.645494733601075
912. the attorney	general of the united states in considering the power of the	secretary to issue similar regulations under the wagner-peyser act	relating to the interstate recruitment of farm workers has rendered	an opinion sustaining his authority.	8.537841045544956
913. further and as an evidence of	legislative intent only the senate of the united states recently	defeated by a substantial majority the holland amendment to the	fair labor standards act which would have specifically limited	the regulatory authority of the secretary in these matters.	6.501144586839923
914. next	let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications	of a failure on our part to pursue our appeals.	8.389488563605939
915. there is far	too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter	hanging in midair.	10.924237391904724
916. the ramifications of the issue are enormous.	11.387658710676023
917. a	decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have	to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations and might in	effect place the public employment services in the position of acting	as strikebreakers.	5.203443827008611
918. the public interest is so dominant in such an issue	that i cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative	order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action	in one or two superior courts in the state.	6.816983349539488
919. it is an issue which	may well reach the supreme court of the united states before judicial	finality is achieved.	14.477019976595734
920. as an administrator i cannot place	the employment service in california in jeopardy of being out of compliance	with the federal laws by my failure to pursue the avenues of	appeal open to me.	7.088470361948485
921. to have applied statewide the decisions of the two	cases heard in superior court in my opinion would have placed us	clearly out of compliance with the wagner-peyser act and would have	immediately opened the way for the secretary of labor were he so	inclined to notify the governor of such noncompliance set a date for	hearing and issue his finding.	5.540270385491435
922. the impact of noncompliance under	the wagner-peyser act is clear: the withdrawal of some $11 million	a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service	program or as a corollary the taking over by the federal government	of its operation.	6.786623877757662
923. thus far the cases which have come before	the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is	vacant due to a strike- condition in the regulation of the secretary.	4.972167907959598
924. none has yet arisen under condition relating to referral	to jobs the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute.	8.234100177747301
925. here the problem is essentially one of defining the word filling.	9.505921215140184
926. should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements	as job specifications union membership union jurisdiction and	the like?	6.783435031846547
927.  or should it have a broader connotation of including wage	demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the	mechanics of filling the job.	5.261226014965208
928. because of the uncertainty	of this definition i solicited the interpretation of the secretary	of labor.	12.429249586316454
929. he has advised me that the narrower interpretation is the	proper one; that is that if wages for example is the only issue	in a labor dispute and no workers have left their jobs because of the	dispute we may continue to make referrals.	5.36872064862156
930. martin and stendler present evidence that infants and young	children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual	level simply by combining objects and counting them.	6.342503627803595
931. after they	have developed concepts they are free from the necessity of manipulating	objects; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely.	7.426019817682833
932. the ability to think seems to increase consistently with age.	10.842380275899938
933. one	experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between	the eleventh and twelfth years.	5.825820622377272
934. many studies indicate that	elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science;	that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes	and events; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities	change and broaden.	6.1052656878841915
935. how a child	feels about himself about other people and about the tasks confronting	him in school may have as much influence on his success in school	as his physical and intellectual characteristics.	5.230707060086062
936. a considerable amount	of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure child is not	likely to do well in school subjects.	7.7184905354990265
937. emotional maturity is the result	of many factors the principal ones being the experiences of the	first few years of the child's life.	5.036725221053489
938. however the teacher who understands	the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly influential	in helping pupils gain confidence security and satisfaction.	7.726515163157427
939. concerning this responsibility of the teacher suggestions for helping	children gain better control of the emotions are presented in chapter	11.	6.5063210612718665
940. the following generalizations about the emotional characteristics	of elementary-school children may be helpful.	9.919242564275502
941. typically	the young child's emotional reactions last for a relatively short	time as contrasted to those of an adult.	6.011680697138881
942. as the child grows	older his emotional reactions lead to moods or emotional states	drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly rather than in	short abrupt outbursts.	9.317683042739707
943. studies of the growth and decline	of children's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects noises	falling and unexpected movement decline during the preschool years	but that fears of the dark of being alone and of imaginary creatures	or robbers increase.	4.538216972561754
944. ridiculing a child for being afraid	or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing	with the problem; more effective solutions include explanations	the example of another child or conditioning by associating the feared	object place or person with something pleasant.	5.792963746401121
945. children	need help in learning to control their emotions.	6.764147616291221
946. the young child	learns from parents and teachers that temper tantrums screaming kicking	and hitting will not get him what he wants; the older child learns	that intense emotional outbursts will not win approval by his peers	and therefore makes a real effort to control his emotions.	6.0900286843600515
947. children differ widely in their emotional responses.	7.14162538120728
948. among infants	the patterns of emotional responses are similar; as the influence	of learning and environment are felt emotional behavior becomes individualized.	7.2700340562052705
949. although no national norms exist	for the social development of children the teacher can find a great	deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed	by children at various age levels.	5.465852293767151
950. the following summary will	give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school	children; the student will certainly want to explore more	deeply into the fascinating study of immature individuals struggling	to meet their developmental needs and at the same time trying to learn	the rules of the game in the ever-expanding number of groups in which	they hold membership.	7.123039924141235
951. during early childhood children	are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than	they are in the approval of other children; after they have been in	school a few years their interest in playmates of their own age increases	and their interest in adults decreases; the child who had once	considered it a treat to accompany his parents on picnics and family	gatherings now considers it a bore.	6.04756762603075
952. in late childhood the influence	of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase;	the group sets the styles in clothing the kind of play engaged in	and the ideals of right and wrong behavior.	0.0
953. in early childhood	the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his	own age or a year or two older who can do the things he likes to do;	such factors as sex intelligence and status in the group do not	influence his choice much at this time.	5.855979668935667
954. in later childhood	an interest in team games replaces individual play; loyalty to the group	a feeling of superiority over those who are not members and unwillingness	to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant traits.	7.983996165091388
955. during early childhood boys tease and bully on the average	more than girls; those who feel inferior or insecure engage in	these activities more than do well-adjusted children.	5.591812762439252
956. during	late childhood boys like to tease jostle and talk smart to girls;	girls who are more mature than boys frown upon the youthful antics	of boys of their own age.	6.221575167356117
957. by the time pupils reach the sixth	grade their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed;	they exhibit a keen interest in social political and economic problems	but they frequently have vague and incorrect notions about the	terms they use rather glibly in their routine school work.	5.1102616481061975
958. between	the ages of two and four years negativism or resistance to adult	authority is noticeable; after the fourth year it begins to decline.	6.257511103075432
959. however as we have seen in later childhood the child begins to	substitute the standards of the peer group for those of parents and teachers.	6.665619053070675
960. the elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability	to work in groups.	9.005093323721033
961. the child in the primary grades can play harmoniously	with one companion but his desire to be first in everything	gets him into trouble when the group gets larger; he wants to be with	people but he hasn't yet learned to cooperate.	5.671692206617755
962. in the middle grades	however he begins to participate more effectively in group activities	such as selecting a leader helping to make plans and carry on	group activities and setting up rules governing the enterprise.	7.792491002394017
963. the teacher should study the individual pupil	much progress has	been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding	children yet in almost any classroom today can be found children	whose needs are not being met by the school program.	5.98418881596091
964. some are failing	to achieve as much as their ability would permit; others never	seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom.	9.504098229645852
965. these children	have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults	who did not understand.	6.055805157036741
966. many school systems now employ school	psychologists and child guidance specialists.	9.310984932657822
967. these specialists	perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children	who need special attention by suggesting ways of meeting the needs	of individual children in the regular classroom and by providing clinical	services for severely maladjusted children.	5.114940505008844
968. it is the classroom	teacher however who has daily contacts with pupils and who is in a	unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice.	9.625938887065374
969. indeed a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work	of the elementary-school teacher rather than merely an additional	chore.	7.343751036392902
970. teachers and administrators in many elementary schools	have assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade into groups on the	basis of test scores solves the problem of meeting the needs of individuals.	6.612952039089439
971. what they should recognize is that children who have been placed	in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely	in attributes that influence success and that they still must be	treated as individuals.	5.844711758112916
972. although the teacher must be concerned with	maintaining standards he must also be concerned about understanding	factors that inhibit	studies conducted in various	sections of the united states indicate that many children in elementary	schools are maladjusted emotionally and that many of them are	failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects.	7.864305926257026
973. one study	which involved 1524 pupils in grades one to six found that 12 percent	of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were reading	a year below capacity.	5.217237238796266
974. it is apparent therefore that the teacher	needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and	adjustment of children.	10.533288261713468
975. when a child fails to meet the standards of	the school in his rate of learning insecurity unhappiness and other	forms of maladjustment frequently follow.	6.412217595248203
976. these maladjustments in	turn inhibit learning and a vicious cycle is completed.	8.540901980461344
977. it is	easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving	in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy or that the	child who lacks interest in school who dislikes the teacher or who	is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent.	5.208458567803553
978. the causes of retardation	and maladjustment may be found in physical factors such as defective	speech or hearing impaired vision faulty motor coordination a frail	constitution chronic disease malnutrition and glandular malfunctioning.	7.043473888800443
979. they may be caused by poor health habits such as faulty eating	and sleeping habits.	8.253914042356069
980. they may be related to mental immaturity or lack	of aptitude for certain types of school work.	10.181913802671334
981. the curriculum may	be too difficult for some and too easy for others.	7.265235339142375
982. teaching methods	learning materials and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead	to maladjustments for some children.	6.984452365343655
983. unwholesome family relations	broken homes and undesirable community influences may also be contributing	factors.	6.5480514549903335
984. this is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit	learning and contribute to maladjustment among children.	12.596554648853818
985. moreover	these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner.	7.867703638253523
986. a	vision handicap that may produce nervous tension and reading	disability	for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement	in reading.	6.290129093830134
987. an impoverished home that may discourage one child may constitute	the motivation causing another to work harder for successful	achievement in school.	5.3633055147404045
988. at any rate the teacher who recognizes common	causes of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal	to eliminate the causes of pupil discouragement failure and maladjustment.	7.799603995101946
989. successful teaching	involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand	why he behaves as he does in certain situations and how his achievement	in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment.	4.849973382004667
990. the classroom teacher cannot be expected to be as proficient in the	use of the techniques of child study as the clinical psychologist;	he cannot be expected to administer all the tests and gather all the information	needed about each child in his classroom.	7.235331035332512
991. he can be expected	however to examine and interpret the information already available;	to refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual children;	and to utilize opportunities arising in connection with regular	classroom activities for gaining a better understanding of his	pupils.	5.691487117936141
992. this section deals with some of the sources of information that	can be tapped by the classroom teacher; chapter 15 provides more	detailed information about specific techniques used in evaluating pupil	progress.	8.488813143506048
993. most school systems today maintain	a system of cumulative records of pupils.	7.066813008944771
994. these records when systematically	maintained provide much information about the children which	the teacher can use in guidance instruction grouping and reporting	to parents.	7.252587982881909
995. each teacher has in his classroom a metal file equipped	with a lock which is used to store cumulative record folders.	5.870969790912406
996. during	summer vacation periods these records are stored in the office of	the principal.	7.8628030788588825
997. only the teacher and other professional personnel are	permitted to see or use these records.	7.0131443394104815
998. each new teacher to whom the	pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record	and to bring it up to date.	7.556189694289375
999. some school systems provide written instructions	to principals and teachers designating when certain information	is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how	the information is to be summarized and used.	5.207650146420509
1000. the summary report on desegregation progress in education in	the middle-south region 1959-1960 clearly shows two pieces of	information.	7.48837548295765
1001. the summary report which was prepared for this conference	indicates first that actual or pending school desegregation is	increasing; second that both actual and pending desegregation is	with few exceptions the product or result of court order.	4.914313482511109
1002. the report	together with other information suggests that desegregation in the	schools is slow.	8.649006242526841
1003. the middle-south region as defined by the	national association of intergroup relations officials	consists of the states of kentucky maryland tennessee west	virginia delaware virginia and the district of columbia.	5.616582412627677
1004. the	states and the nation's capital all have some desegregation in	fact some dating back to 1954; but the region also embraces some of	the staunchest opposition.	6.09983039226678
1005. desegregation has been opposed by massive	resistance interposition pupil assignment	and hate bombings.	6.21335703944963
1006. now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation	and such increase as a result of court order.	11.784653133941777
1007. elementary school desegregation came to owen and union counties	which already had high school desegregation.	5.542917982132687
1008. the action was a result	of a court order the citation for which	is taken from the summary report for this	conference.	8.15695185456378
1009. in maryland the harford county board of education	had prepared a desegregation plan which the court approved but	which a plaintiff had challenged; thus county school board and federal	court joined hands here to promote school desegregation.	5.16038968630919
1010. additional	school desegregation in tennessee resulted from a court	order opening a school serving children of military personnel.	6.757567981697296
1011. similarly	further desegregation may come from suits pending in three tennessee	cities chattanooga knoxville and memphis.	5.542917982132687
1012. in west virginia	the number of white and negro children attending the same school	has increased almost twofold.	8.749404314322682
1013. there are no court decisions here.	19.958364912133884
1014. as in maryland a district court has approved an official plan	of school desegregation in delaware.	9.424725859175071
1015. as a result of the state	board of education plan negro children entered heretofore white	elementary schools in five districts.	9.913616810611966
1016. the third circuit court of	appeals is reviewing an appeal from the plan.	9.43134784087491
1017. in virginia	court orders led to desegregation in charlottesville and floyd counties.	7.764524855587911
1018. desegregation in pulaski county is pending because of court	order although date of admission is not yet determined.	7.06553080737244
1019. negro parents	have filed application for admission of additional children to schools	in alexandria arlington fairfax and warren counties.	5.526213915303859
1020. desegregation	can also result from additional suits brought by negro plaintiffs	against school boards in newport news fairfax county arlington	county and norfolk.	6.365727389270327
1021. as a school district the district	of columbia has had desegregated schools since 1954 shortly	after the supreme court decision.	8.242176773026923
1022. this recapitulation makes	it clear that school desegregation continues including the old dominion	state in spite of its stern resistance.	8.520606208420734
1023. the record is clear that	increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result	of a court order; that on the immediate horizon if further large-scale	desegregation comes it will result from court	orders on suits filed in several middle-south states.	4.89019406951158
1024. knowledge	that thousands of school districts are involved and observation that	school desegregation has occurred in only a handful in 1959-1960 leads	to a conclusion that desegregation-from-court-order is slow.	6.174865662068697
1025. before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us at	this regional conference i wish to note a small item in the summary	report as it refers to the district of columbia.	5.608378724760888
1026. that reference	in the report is continuation of the trend toward an all-negro	school system a remark apparently occasioned by the increase of negro	school population from 74.	7.23341234556487
1027. 1 per cent to 76.	18.159921720998078
1028. i see no	real prospects for an all-negro school population.	10.853733375513935
1029. west of rock creek	park is still monolithically white and is in fact increasingly white	as a result of georgetown's conversion-by-renovation housing program.	7.637176790013891
1030. nearby foggy bottom is ousting negroes.	9.670406878971576
1031. the large acreage	in the southwest redevelopment area beckons white people- what with	high-priced town houses and elevator apartments.	6.241511921909045
1032. the capitol hill	rehabilitation like foggy bottom replaces negroes with whites	.	9.430036403335416
1033. the sharpest	break with tradition the past and present of white ring around	a black core may come with the opening of nearby montgomery county	suburbs to negro residents and presumably the consequent conclusion	of some whites that they cannot escape the negro by fleeing to	the suburbs.	5.393095269041167
1034. in fact short of fleeing to warrenton virginia or rockville	maryland white people may have to live with negroes.	11.243567652193885
1035. all	of this must be taken into account before the image of an all-negro	dc public school system is conjured up.	0.0
1036. solve	from the summary report before us at this conference a number	of problems are apparent.	7.032105024464237
1037. they vex us and perplex us but generally	do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems.	6.165728248550333
1038. first how can we step up the desegregation movement?	10.525836280374072
1039.  it is slow.	36.00803266626256
1040. i believe we all want more schools where white and negro together	can and do attend.	10.160786003411646
1041. i believe we all want no child denied admission to	a school on account of his color.	7.834138346144816
1042. in general members of nairo	would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence	or within his residence zone.	8.23689773845506
1043. how to achieve this objective is	a problem but we are not divided on what we want.	8.146047738832012
1044. second as	we increase the number of desegregated school districts and schools themselves	how can we achieve this action through school board action?	7.150025474360661
1045. 	it may be county school board or state school board action as well	as that of municipal school boards.	5.491101831995351
1046. correlatively can we reduce the	role of the district courts so that the action is that of the people	of the community or other school district and not that of the law court?	8.512051346397202
1047. 	this is a problem and i believe there is little difference of	opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise and	effect a plan of desegregation.	6.20438690488103
1048. third how can we insure a systematic	and continuing group relations education in the schools?	8.949204387592383
1049.  not	simply a brief program when the schools are actually desegregated but	a continuing program that also promotes integration that encourages	the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or negro	but as human beings.	5.146252086216957
1050. again the problem is how to get it done and	in what form to offer the group relations education; not whether it	should be done.	9.62410916260667
1051. fourth in the segregated school system during	the period before desegregation how can we assure equal opportunity?	5.687143305087192
1052. 	in fact in the desegregated school system which may have a good	many schools with all-negro population how can we assure equal opportunity?	6.870182299201061
1053. 	this is a problem but we are not divided over its importance	or by its existence.	7.689518665736176
1054. fifth in the segregated school system	or in the all-negro or all-white schools how can we encourage better	group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong	to the group?	6.418498781227117
1055.  can we help children adjust to images of other	children when the latter are not actually present.	6.548128333577244
1056. if we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively	united fashion then there are twice as many issues which i judge sharply	issue	since on the one hand school	desegregation	has come in virginia hand-in-glove with pupil assignment shall	we support the plan?	7.468626253551224
1057.  on the basis of pupil assignment criteria	judge albert bryan has assigned negro children to formerly white	schools in arlington and alexandria virginia.	7.566995301365297
1058. shall we support pupil	assignment?	12.08571470746697
1059.  on the other hand looking at the larger picture	is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off blocked or	reduced school desegregation to a trickle?	7.238291033951676
1060.  shall we therefore	oppose the plan?	10.887392182380525
1061.  this question is an issue because it likely divides	issue	no 2.	8.243506903035994
1062. in large cities	like baltimore louisville and washington dc should school	desegregation be extended to all-negro and all-white schools by	assigning white and negro teachers respectively?	7.50900266382061
1063.  on the one hand	do we argue the supreme court decision required only that a child	not be denied admission to a school on account of his race?	7.742430282571253
1064.  or should	we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different	races and that that is impossible in an all-something-or-the-other	school we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust	to people of another race within the school namely to a teacher of another	race.	6.174419021617177
1065. we can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation	impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated	issue no 3.	6.9024427847783665
1066. the earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that	resulted in desegregation.	8.974001790468822
1067. in each instance the plaintiff was a private	citizen.	11.748931559410442
1068. in thousands of school districts indeed in the entire	state of mississippi no plaintiff has come forth.	8.621803017189182
1069. and i have established	that the action of municipal county or state school boards	or boards of education is small infinitesimally small in comparison	with the number of districts.	6.901257031030996
1070. is the requirement that the plaintiff be	a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement?	9.596201387549032
1071. 	should congress authorize the attorney general to file suit to accomplish	admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance?	0.0
1072. 	even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision	for the attorney general to act was eliminated should we	nevertheless	support such a clause?	6.902872009265514
1073.  this is an issue for it divides	issue no 4.	12.213840627304437
1074. withholding of funds to	schools	that deny children on account of race.	8.392032887190927
1075. which in 1957 divided even a liberal group like the american	veterans committee.	6.92414119425721
1076. should we support a clause in federal	school construction or school assistance legislation that would	deny federal funds to a school district that denies admission to a	child on account of his race?	6.477241619526408
1077.  this is softer than earlier powell amendments	which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts.	7.523821884502484
1078. there is nonetheless considerable argument against the clause	softened though it be on the grounds that federal aid is so necessary	to the public schools.	10.605516123639461
1079. the federal funds limitation enlists the support	issue no 5.	8.276403335092047
1080. state or county	or municipality be required to furnish public education?	9.554555841575683
1081.  for the	school year 1959-1960 the prince edward county board	of supervisors voted not to provide funds for public education and	the school board therefore could provide no public education- for white	or negro children.	5.102165593191952
1082. is public education in this american democracy	of such importance that no child should be denied public education?	8.107627726014146
1083. 	or is this subject a matter of self-determination a matter of states	rights or county rights?	7.210974487494139
1084.  if people don't want to provide public	education should they be forced to do so?	9.79738818399648
1085.  even if we marshal substantial	agreement behind mandatory public education we likely cannot	expect that all the states will enact the legislation.	7.323296889232142
1086. should the	requirement which must therefore be federal in nature be legislated	by the united states congress?	8.945938718826888
1087.  or must it become law by amendment	of the united states constitution?	8.329196984053567
1088.  we actually have two issues	issue no 6.	12.350455461918722
1089. federal	responsibility	if the above issue is settled	by requiring public education for all citizens issue no 6 may	be moot.	5.236383152695367
1090. if on the other hand it is not settled or while it is being	debated and resolved does the federal government have a responsibility	in situations like that in prince edward county?	9.25882300053806
1091.  nearly	half the children still receive no education.	7.14162538120728
1092. must or should the federal	government help?	11.370484883642249
1093.  should the government directly provide education	for the children who want public education?	6.555286197930895
1094. 	the next question is whether board members favor their own social	classes in their roles as educational policy-makers.	7.754381775881478
1095. on the whole	it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit	way.	8.425242012536481
1096. seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly	drawn.	7.391013650626644
1097. a hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment	of a free public junior college in a community where there already	was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately	but was too expensive for working-class youth.	5.683552629648356
1098. in situations	of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education.	10.719333657765663
1099. campbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve	western cities over the period of 1931-40 and found little or no	relationship between certain social and economic factors and school	board competence as judged by a panel of professional educators who	studied the voting records on educational issues.	4.724966825105998
1100. the few cases	of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not	to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who	favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay	increases for teachers and such issues are not issues of educational	policy.	6.367977412875587
1101. in general it appears that trustees and board members	attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of	educational policy and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant	values of the society are middle-class values which are generally	thought	to be valid for the entire society.	6.361855879047815
1102. there have been very few cases	of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any	other class in the field of educational policy.	12.699315043633343
1103. if there were more such	cases it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers	favor their own social classes.	9.748992772700257
1104. there is currently a major	controversy of public education in which group interests and values	are heavily engaged.	11.893664365676829
1105. this is the issue of segregated schools in the	south.	13.702921946106619
1106. in this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial	groups rather than social-class groups.	12.308892810911882
1107. thus the white middle and	lower classes are arrayed against the negro middle and lower classes.	7.263647365339972
1108. this conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class	people better than it suits white lower-class people.	8.617809549820223
1109. if this happens	there may be some class conflict in the south with school boards	and school teachers taking the middle-class position.	7.347898120065516
1110. profession	the members of the educational profession have	a major voice in the determination of educational policy their position	being strongest in the universities.	6.89969586624074
1111. they are mostly upper-middle-	and lower-middle-class people with a few in the upper class.	8.787595714730568
1112. do they	make class-biased decisions?	18.261201714858576
1113.    in a society dominated by middle-class	values and working in an institution which transmits and strengthens	these social values it is clear that the educational profession	must work for the values which are characteristic of the society.	7.154243147573318
1114. there is no problem here.	38.54824360862788
1115. the problem arises if it does arise when	the educator has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his	professional competence but which bears some relation to the social	structure.	6.205198848764056
1116. for instance in giving school grades or in making recommendations	for the award of a college scholarship does he consciously	or unconsciously favor students of one or another social class?	8.529381149776272
1117.  again	in deciding on the content and method of his teaching does he favor	a curriculum which will make his students stronger competitors in the	race for higher economic status or does he favor a curriculum which	strengthens students in other ways?	4.958642668081173
1118.    the answers to questions	such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the educator's	own social-class position and also upon his social history as well as	upon his personality and what he conceives his mission to be as an educator.	7.451224991241274
1119. in a set of case studies of teachers with various social-class	backgrounds wattenberg illustrates a variety of approaches to students	and to teaching which depend upon the teacher's personality as	well as on his social-class background.	5.693122519752309
1120. one upward-mobile teacher may	be a hard taskmaster for lower-class pupils because she wants them to	develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb while	another upward-mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with	lower-class pupils because he knows their disadvantages and deprivations	at home and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment.	6.277950691907261
1121. one social-class factor which plays a large part in educational policy	today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are	upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class families.	8.12586095518219
1122. their own experience in the social system influences their work and	attitudes as teachers.	8.421470663586687
1123. while this influence is a complex matter depending	upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his	social-class experience there probably are some general statements about	social-class background and educational policy that can be made with	a fair degree of truth.	5.929995765816837
1124. teachers who have been upward mobile	probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves	students as it has served them; that is they are likely to favor	a kind of education that has vocational-advancement value.	6.387270587124048
1125. this does	not necessarily	mean that such teachers will favor vocational education	as contrasted with liberal education but they are likely to favor	an approach to liberal education which has a maximal vocational-advancement	value as against a kind of pure liberal education that	is not designed to help people get better jobs.	5.121493868389423
1126. there is no doubt	that higher education since world war 2 has moved away from	pure liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and	specialization.	10.854145123463256
1127. there are several causes for this one being rapid economic	development with increasing numbers of middle-class positions	requiring engineering or scientific training.	7.59824863207075
1128. but another cause may	lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their	own use of education as a means of social advancement.	9.483146522310149
1129. compared	with the college and university faculty members of the period from	1900 to 1930 the new postwar faculty members consist of more children	of immigrants and more children	of urban working-class fathers.	5.550364805113821
1130. their experience is quite in contrast	with that of children of upper- and upper-middle-class native-born	parents who are more likely to regard education as good for its own	sake and to discount the vocational emphases in the curriculum.	5.975020594050363
1131. public interest groups	educational policies are formed by	several groups who are officially or unofficially appointed to act in	the public interest.	5.436915451534505
1132. legislators are one such group and state legislators	have major responsibility for educational legislation.	7.573678157029758
1133. they generally	vote so as to serve their own constituency and if the constituency	should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class they might	be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class interests	in education.	5.384436755662661
1134. however there are relatively few such political constituencies	and as has been pointed out there is seldom a clear-cut distinction	between the educational interests of one social class and those	of another.	8.188238995637574
1135. another public interest group is the commission	of laymen or educators which is appointed to study an educational problem	and to make recommendations.	5.1810199162904835
1136. generally these commissions work	earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society as they conceive	it.	9.294980793470286
1137. nevertheless their conclusions and recommendations cannot	please everybody and they often represent a particular economic or political	point of view.	5.540612788665263
1138. for instance there have been two presidential	commissions on higher education since world war 2.	9.954621313235615
1139. president	truman's commission on higher education tended to take a liberal	expansionist position while president eisenhower's committee	on education beyond the high school was slightly more conservative.	5.454939918723396
1140. both commissions consisted of upper-middle- and upper-class people	who attempted to act in the public interest.	9.482598161344603
1141. an example of a	more definite class bias is noted in proceedings of the commission on	the financing of higher education sponsored by the association of	american universities and supported by the rockefeller foundation	and the carnegie corporation.	5.880463582323862
1142. this commission recommended against	the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities	and against a broad program of government-supported scholarships.	7.63730999433199
1143. this might be said to be an upper- or an upper-middle-class bias	but the commission published as one of its staff studies a book by	byron s hollingshead entitled who should go to college?	7.727089597623813
1144. 	which recommended a federal government scholarship program.	9.917546257747134
1145. furthermore	the commission set up the council for financial aid to education	as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support	of private higher education.	5.302159047362073
1146. thus the commission acted with a	sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions	about the problem of government support to private education.	8.440386484331679
1147. then	there are the trustees and officers of the great educational foundations	who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by	their support or refusal to support various educational programs experiments	and demonstrations.	5.104444336480956
1148. these people are practically always upper-	or upper-middle-class persons who attempt to act in what they regard	as the interest of the entire society.	9.103410757568346
1149. finally there are	the parent organizations and the laymen's organizations such as the	national association of parents and teachers and the citizens committee	on public schools.	5.213142008167744
1150. these have an upper-middle-class leadership	and a middle-class membership with rare exceptions where working-class	parents are active in local p-ta matters.	7.102710703707135
1151. like	the	other policy-making groups these are middle class in their educational	attitudes and they attempt to act in the general public interest	as they see it.	6.439371841790622
1152. in general it appears that educational decisions	and educational policies are made by people who intend to act in the	interests of the society as a whole.	8.1074534664535
1153. they are predominantly middle-	and upper-class people and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes	of those classes.	6.9981532216848175
1154. they may be unaware of the existence of lower-class	values and consequently fail to take them into account.	11.14482350074271
1155. but there	is very little frank and conscious espousal of the interests of any one	social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education.	8.060959254816881
1156. they think of themselves as trustees for the entire society	and try to serve the entire society.	10.117231603742042
1157. structure through education	educational policy in the united states	has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural	opportunity.	6.768046299083138
1158. in so far as this goal is achieved the society becomes more	fluid artificial barriers to social mobility are reduced and people	at the lower end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the	material	and cultural goods of society.	7.165973639630922
1159. on the other hand there is a counterbalancing	purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages	of the parents to their children.	9.727633695331967
1160. this leads to efforts at exclusiveness	through private schools and to the maintenance of social stratification	in the schools.	11.345119129267111
1161. both of these purposes exist side by side without much	overt conflict under present conditions.	7.9972330755528285
1162. cultural opportunity	the broad expansion of free education results	both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society	and in promoting fluidity within the social structure.	6.441138201362311
1163. fifty years	ago the general raising of the school-leaving age to sixteen was an	example of this movement.	6.002215013717486
1164. during the past decade the program has been	carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities	state colleges and community colleges.	10.054652246647121
1165. the reaffirmation of	american faith in the comprehensive high school as expressed in the	conant study is another indication of the liveliness of the ideal of	maximizing opportunity through the equalizing of educational opportunity.	5.932533542136036
1166. the recent federal government's student-loan program is	another step in the direction of making higher education more available	to lower-status youth.	8.649388165460405
1167. it is probably more effective than the expanded	scholarship programs of the past decade because the scholarship programs	mainly aided the students with the best academic records	and these students tended to use the scholarship	funds to go to more expensive colleges.	7.495286101715725
1168. meanwhile the private	colleges have increased their tuition rates so much that they have raised	an economic barrier which dwarfs their scholarship funds.	7.676127303733819
1169. the gains	in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place	largely in the publicly supported institutions.	7.02656389681376
1170. unfortunately however and for reasons to be discussed in the	following chapter no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory	as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal	costs in order to yield adequate revenues.	7.445741734804247
1171. and this fact may explain	some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational	formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units	of service.	6.2781638530718995
1172. one such disagreement which will receive attention in	this next chapter concerns the question whether rates for different kinds	of service in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination must	be made directly proportional to marginal costs or whether they	should be based instead on differences in marginal costs.	6.502755049470885
1173. here	the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma.	6.605795273199848
1174. of fully distributed cost analysis	despite	an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define relative costs	the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as	far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice.	6.546426555807296
1175. for more explicit expositions one must distinguish different types	of analyses.	7.737557619512619
1176. by all means the most important distinction is that	between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution	of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental	or marginal costs and those other apportionments which recognize no	difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution.	6.095530112225769
1177. the first or double-step type might also be called the railroad	type because of its application to railroads	by the cost section of the interstate commerce	commission.	6.432115827158744
1178. the cost section distinguishes between	variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding	chapter.	10.24704502735875
1179. the variable costs alone are assigned to the different units	of freight traffic as representing long-run out-of-pocket costs-	a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of	the economist's long-run marginal costs.	5.0046560062954315
1180. there remains a residue	of total costs or total revenue requirements which since	it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations	in traffic density is strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis.	8.032408593233063
1181. nevertheless because the cost section has felt impelled to make	some kind of a distribution of total costs it has apportioned this residue	which it sometimes calls burden among the units of carload	traffic on a basis which is concededly	quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination.	4.866873249240942
1182. in recent	years this burden	has amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements	which the carload freight business is supposed to be called upon to	meet.	0.0
1183. since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad	rates it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff	of the interstate commerce commission has estimated out-of-pocket	costs and apportioned residue costs.	5.73960382994971
1184. suffice it to say that the usefulness	of the latter apportionment is questionable.	9.702587602609029
1185. but in any event	full credit should be given to the cost section for its express and	overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost	analyses: namely that between a cost allocation designed to	reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates	of output of different classes of utility service; and a mere cost apportionment	which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service	even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint	of specific cost determination.	4.943969441475346
1186. we turn	now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which unlike the railroad	type draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost	apportionment: the single-step type.	6.800110163833493
1187. it might be called the public	utility type because of the considerable use to which it has	been put in gas and electric utility rate cases.	7.829481784314367
1188. here no attempt is	made first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose	on these costs reasonably distributed residues of total	costs.	7.598128215981978
1189. instead all of the total costs are treated as variable costs	although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be	functions of different variables.	6.246346625347419
1190. moreover whereas in interstate commerce	commission parlance variable cost means a cost deemed to	vary in direct proportion to changes in rate of output in the type	of analysis now under review variable cost has been used more	broadly so as to cover costs which while a function of some one variable	are not necessarily	a linear function.	5.956240182645304
1191. as already noted in an earlier	paragraph the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or	utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes	of service such as residential commercial industrial power street	lighting etc.	5.149423346456481
1192. this grand division permits many costs to be	assigned in their entirety to some one class such as street lighting	or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes.	6.383022820802808
1193. high-tension industrial power service for example would not	be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of	the low-tension distribution lines.	5.255287088186279
1194. but the major portions of the total	costs of a utility business are common or joint to all or nearly	all classes of customers; and these costs must somehow be apportioned	among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among	the units of service in order to report unit costs than can serve	as tentative measures of reasonable rates.	6.172384540920799
1195. the general basis on	which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units	of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem	of an electric-utility cost analysis.	5.498561634147128
1196. but before turning to this	example we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis both of which belong	to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type.	7.802811247176351
1197. in the first subtype the analyst	distributes both total operating	costs and total annual capital costs	among the different	classes and units of service.	7.15854186241599
1198. here an apportionment say of $5000000	of the total costs to residential service as a class would include	an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital	is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential consumers.	7.098185761692722
1199. but in the second subtype which i take to be the one	more frequently applied only the operating expenses and not the cost	of capital or fair return are apportioned directly among the	various classes of service.	6.5484560153267966
1200. to be sure the capital investments in	the plant and	equipment are apportioned among the different classes as are also the	gross revenues received from the sales of the different services.	8.327572134720933
1201. but	any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service	over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as a return	realized on the capital investment attributed to the same	service.	4.900359208359081
1202. thus during any given year if the revenues from the residential	service are $7000000 if the operating expenses imputed	to this class of service come to $5000000 and if the net investment	in the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this	service amounts to $30000000 the cost analyst will report that residential	service in the aggregate has yielded a return of $2000000	or 6-23 per cent.	5.732363833492211
1203. other services will show different rates of return	some probably much lower and some higher.	5.932668809030131
1204. there are obvious	reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding cost of capital	from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different	classes of service- notably the avoidance of the controversial question	what rate of return should be held to constitute cost of capital	or fair rate of return.	6.482706657363348
1205. but the practice is likely to be	misleading since it may seem to support a conclusion that as long	as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating	expenses plus some return on capital investment however low the	rates of charge for this service are compensatory.	5.4897241803631935
1206. needless to say any	such inference would be quite unwarranted.	9.765079463883898
1207. for the reason just	suggested i shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distributed	cost apportionment in the following simplified example.	8.019190568547684
1208. that	is to say an allowance for cost of capital will be assumed to	be included directly in the cost apportionment.	7.872567421239768
1209. of the costs of an electric utility business	in order to simplify	the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis let us	assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company	supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation	plant.	5.602163009530796
1210. let us also assume the existence of only one class or type	of service all of which is supplied at the same voltage phase etc	to residential commercial and industrial customers.	9.420640188772014
1211. this latter	assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial	aspect of modern public utility cost analysis- the distinction among	costs that are functions of outputs of the same service measured along	different dimensions.	5.262086440614487
1212. since the company under review is supplying	what we are here regarding as only one kind of service we might	suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very	simple; indeed that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual	operating and capital costs of the business followed by a calculation	of this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption.	7.161203170768335
1213. in fact however the problem is not so simple.	15.219523859943813
1214. for a statement	of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these	costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output of	energy.	9.928002026307343
1215. a recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required.	8.152205351147632
1216. the simplest division and the one most frequently used	in gas and electric rate cases is a threefold division	of the total operating and capital costs into customer costs	energy or volumetric costs and demand or capacity	costs.	6.29138468634276
1217. if this threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart	in the actual rates of charge for service as it actually does	have in some rates there would result a three-part rate for any one	class of service.	5.163121678757553
1218. for example the monthly bill of a residential	consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge a $5 charge for 250	kilowatt-hours of energy at 2 per kilowatt-hour and a $2 charge for	a maximum demand of 2 kilowatts during the month at the rate of $1	per kilowatt- a total bill of $8 for that month.	6.991417721034758
1219. but our present interest	lies in the measurement of costs of service and only indirectly	in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs.	6.626742685067913
1220. let	us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn recognizing	that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative	1.	7.6901410232041085
1221. the	these are those operating and capital costs found to	vary with number of customers regardless or almost regardless of power	consumption.	5.083242045036259
1222. included as a minimum are the costs of metering and	billing along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in	taking on another consumer.	6.696093201836714
1223. these minimum costs may come to $1 per month	more or less for residential and small commercial customers although	they are substantially higher for large industrial users who require	more costly connections and metering devices.	4.7645920265937844
1224. while costs on this	order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial	rates in the form of a mere service charge they are more	frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which entitles	the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further	payment.	6.726592819681311
1225. but the really controversial aspect of customer-cost	imputation arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice	of including not just those costs that can be definitely earmarked	as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial	fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary	distribution system- a fraction equal to the estimated	annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity.	5.469290066905308
1226. the preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined	by the sociologist.	9.430036403335416
1227. like primitive numbers in mathematics the entire	axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth.	5.898636882953763
1228. but what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces	the idea of physical models?	10.543828561426215
1229.  is it not the task of philosophy	to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred	canons in social science?	8.43492871995475
1230.  it has become painfully clear that the	very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by	erecting mathematical and physical models is itself a conditioned response	to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation.	7.847253396487836
1231. this push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the	measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led	sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word mass to	mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals	in such a group can be studied.	5.859074110365147
1232. here i think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent.	14.688678557602351
1233. the simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs	to be questioned.	8.157035641407274
1234. for if the small group notion involves the implicit	claim that the phenomena of sociological investigations are of atomic	or subatomic proportions the philosopher needs to know the extent to	which such entities are valid.	7.016367880833384
1235. the mere exploration of the unconscious	ground of present-day sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical	and logical investigation.	6.1911212416779
1236. a parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation	between perceptions experientially received and conceptions logically	formed.	9.575372008066365
1237. philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection	of socially viable categories.	6.367407910234083
1238. this involves a sifting of the	empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement.	7.994071539716753
1239. merton's functional sociology may have great practical use in	the study of different cultures yet it is perfectly clear as nagel	and hempel indicate that the concept	of function in sociology has been built up from physiological and biological	models in which the notions of teleology ie metaphysical	purpose are central.	4.715509317355069
1240. functionalism as	a sociological credo is therefore not a direct consequence of observations	but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical inference	and judgment.	6.365727389270327
1241. the purpose of this sort of philosophical study	of sociology is not to tyrannize but to clarify the principles of social	science.	9.402195775359038
1242. it is absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise	to sociology since the former is a logical rational discipline	where sociology is essentially descriptive and empirical.	8.018844848075974
1243. such a position	entails the negation of philosophy in its platonic form as something	soaring above and embracing the empirical and mathematical sciences.	5.7929353629881115
1244. but contrary to whitehead philosophy is not a synonym for plato.	11.404277255950271
1245. the uses of philosophy as a logical clearing house are manifest to	any approach that does not descend to pure sensationalism.	6.102898869250824
1246. however	when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences to dictate the	conditions of empirical research	it becomes formal metaphysics; shaping	the contours of life to fit the needs of legends.	6.696397702691348
1247. the notion of philosophy	as queen bee may fit well with authoritarian modes of political	ideology but it has been noted that the price of such an imperial	notion of philosophy is the frustration and flagellation of the social	sciences.	6.095514496605017
1248. metaphysics is no longer a direct grappling with	nature as it was in antiquity.	11.157379083582882
1249. it has surrendered any claims of description	in favor of psychological accounts of nothingness as in heidegger's	system.	8.021836531942338
1250. science is mocked for wishing to know nothing	of nothing in a last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense	of men.	7.804761911388139
1251. it is not positivism which has isolated metaphysics from reality	by distinguishing between description and prescription.	9.660710924929665
1252. it is	simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during	this century.	10.49146609895339
1253. consider the traditional four fields	of philosophy: logic ethics epistemology and esthetics.	7.261543109985577
1254. it is a	commonplace that to the degree these special preserves of past philosophic	hunting grounds establish an empirical content and suitable methodological	criteria they move away from philosophy as such.	8.06188135958303
1255. what is left	to traditional systems of philosophy is in effect only the history	of these fields prior to their becoming rigorous enough to abide by	the canons of scientific method.	5.654245249855714
1256. in this situation philosophy has survived	by separating itself from metaphysics by showing the ultimate	questions to be the meaningless questions.	9.743056835887879
1257. the relinquishing	by philosophy of pretentious claims to empirical priority gives it an	ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was	unable to examine because of its missionary attitude to knowledge of	more humble sorts.	5.513643653089337
1258. in the new situation philosophy is able to provide	the social sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers	the physical sciences a reservoir of logical relations that can be used	in framing hypotheses having explanatory and predictive value.	7.947251282487832
1259. beyond	this philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the	type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry	but within its potential domain of relevance.	4.656645272807095
1260. in this connection	it might be noted that the theory of games was a mathematical discovery	long before its uses in political science were exploited.	9.543527831997404
1261. likewise	kant formulated the nebular hypothesis according to which the solar	system was evolved from a rotating mass of incandescent gas nearly	a half century before its scientific value was made plain by laplace	in his systeme du monde.	4.682905547111112
1262. this does not mean that philosophy resolves	the problems it generates any more so than riemann's geometry	settled the physical status of the space-time continuum.	11.027680812644316
1263. but the forceful	presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself	a monumental task.	8.038703595484005
1264. to those raised on marcel's homo viator	and heidegger's das nichtige this may seem a modest	role for philosophy.	7.833253706904074
1265. however modesty and triviality are different qualities.	8.921104766067472
1266. philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear	as less dramatic than philosophy which jeers as the sciences evolve.	6.626280802859932
1267. the ceaseless effort to understand and measure the distance mankind	has traversed since its primitive anthropological status offers a	more durable sort of drama.	5.584198977541488
1268. by clarifying fundamental premises in the	social sciences and defining the logical problems emergent at the borderlands	of each new scientific discipline philosophy can offer the	sort of distinction that can accelerate growth in human understanding.	6.046793257967282
1269. philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful	and self-content by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis	or theory is framed.	5.0091594061022
1270. the dissection of scientific theory the examination	of a theory from the vantage-points of language epistemology	and ethics is itself a distinct contribution to knowledge no less	so because of its removal from empirical research.	6.604928934093401
1271. the realm	of science whatever the degree of precision in formulations covers	the range of prediction and explanation.	6.629853932146729
1272. whatever philosophy is conceived to be its rationalist	logistic attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is	something other than science.	7.196029026127741
1273. for some forms of philosophy this very	division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the	metaphysical superiority of the latter.	6.312604101438946
1274. bergson and leroy announce	that the secret is the center of a philosophy and thereafter a	hundred followers declare secrecy a higher verity.	8.154860344546112
1275. this is simply a	confession of intellectual sterility spruced up to look virtuous.	8.971206041118126
1276. for	as merleau-ponty indicated it is not the secret which is important	but the removal of secrecy.	9.416504865346
1277. in this philosophy and science	share a common goal.	11.289188492680237
1278. the hypostatization of the secret nonetheless guarantees	that the division of analytical and synthetic philosophies shall	not be overcome by even the most persuasive argument; for this	division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between	mysticism and science.	6.5515977130091265
1279. the mystification of metaphysical systems	does not imply the demise of philosophy only the close of a philosophic	age which demanded metaphysics to be rational and logical.	6.1336004932451464
1280. the	tenacity with which present metaphysical attitudes fetishize private	intuition offers the strongest evidence that the gulf between scientific	and delphic ways of philosophizing is built into the present conflict	over the limits and purpose of science religion and ideology.	6.298762235740595
1281. scientific systems and this includes even	the relation of mechanist to relativist physics are built upon refined	and corrected.	5.236383152695367
1282. philosophic systems by the very nature of their completeness	are overthrown by rival systems.	7.198778874655976
1283. in addition to the incompleteness	of science and the completeness of metaphysics they differ	in that science is essentially descriptive while philosophy in its inherited	forms tends to be goal-oriented teleological and prescriptive.	6.959931780696591
1284. the threadbare notion that belief unlike behaviour is not subject	to objective analysis has placed intuitive metaphysics squarely against	the sociology of knowledge since it is precisely the job of the	sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less viable	than social behaviour.	6.570956485993961
1285. when dealing with the actual relation	of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge or better the role of philosophy	in assisting research on the social sources of ideas one has	to become necessarily selective.	5.768583696158625
1286. certain features we have touched upon:	philosophy as a logical deductive system from which a social science	methodology can be built up; philosophic analysis of the assumptions	and presumptions of the social sciences; and philosophy as a	guide to possible integration of supposedly disparate sociological	investigations.	6.290778560527093
1287. the objection will be raised that the most important	role of philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted	namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms operative in	the social sciences.	5.768460878890224
1288. specifically it will be asked whether the real	questions people ask are not the ultimate questions that	social science finds itself impotent in the face of.	8.066707171169428
1289. what then is the	status of such questions as: is society the ground of human existence	or a means to an individual goal?	6.203584787227825
1290.  do societies develop according	to cosmic patterns or are they subject only to the free choice of individuals?	9.82027051272064
1291. 	does society really exist as an entity over and above the	agglomeration of men?	5.916704755177494
1292.  i think it must be said that contrary to metaphysical	insistence these are questions so framed as to defy either	empirical exploration or rational solutions.	11.19925791115224
1293. as simmel and dilthey	indicated questions of whether the value of life is individual	or social are not questions but assertions of faith made to	appear as legitimate questions.	5.8119128086058645
1294. such pseudo-questions assume that answers	of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving	undefined universals.	8.18406868512247
1295. social theory has no more right to expect results	from meaningless questions than physics has the right to expect a	theological solution to the wave-particle controversy.	5.888960893337554
1296. it is not	that such questions are not asked.	17.744974402673652
1297. it is rather that introducing them	into social analysis reflects not so much a search for truth as for	certainty.	9.285833073983893
1298. an operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract	certainty since it is certainty which every new discovery in science	either replaces or reshapes.	7.331893982877648
1299. to raise the added objection that	men require certainty on psychological grounds answers to ultimate questions	having an irrational rather than scientific basis is in a real	sense to undermine the objection itself.	5.498075971750319
1300. for what concerns all scientific	disciplines is precisely that which can be captured for the rational	ie for the scientific determination of what in past ages	was considered ultimate and irrational.	7.095486907174545
1301. a philosophy which attempts	to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its acquiescence	in the shortcomings of men an impatience with partial tentative	solutions.	5.23666488506328
1302. men have always lived in a tentative world and in suspension	of ultimate judgments where and when necessary.	7.2569122533878225
1303. uncertainty	overcoming itself is the precondition of the quest for new and more precise	information about the world.	5.326519577128725
1304. without such uncertainty we are left	with a set of dogmas and myths.	8.400219018728693
1305. the functional interplay of philosophy	and science should as a minimum guarantee a meaningful option to	myth-making.	6.196120048044738
1306. a degree of indefiniteness is a salutary condition	for the growth of science.	10.813708723159403
1307. but neither was the statement empirical for goodness was not a quality	like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard.	7.1836338993191795
1308. what were they to	do then with these awkward judgments of value?	9.692079389089505
1309.  to find a place for	them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the	theory radically and yet that theory was what they regarded as their	most important discovery.	5.726373782489891
1310. it appeared that the theory could be saved	in one way only.	11.258873390551564
1311. if it could be shown that judgments of good and bad	were not judgments at all that they asserted nothing true or false but	merely expressed emotions like hurrah or fiddlesticks	then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads	could be at rest.	5.404611986844873
1312. this is the course the positivists took.	20.334890541159552
1313. they	explained value judgments by explaining them away.	7.14162538120728
1314. now i do not	think their view will do.	10.368578803405029
1315. but before discussing it i should like	to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they	have stated their case.	6.22393678386507
1316. it has been said of john stuart mill that	he wrote so clearly that he could be found out.	12.51688530636644
1317. this theory has been	put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind	and this i will do my best to supply.	6.096872517459443
1318. the theory claims to show	by analysis that when we say that is good we do not mean to assert	a character of the subject of which we are thinking.	11.240501213712339
1319. i shall argue	that we do mean to do just that.	8.923546411515362
1320. let us work through an example	and the simpler and commoner the better.	10.125374979086894
1321. there is perhaps no value	statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement	that intense pain is bad.	8.033060748645113
1322. let us take a set of circumstances	in which i happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which	i think every one of us might naturally make such a statement.	8.000885227806465
1323. we	come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal traps in	common use.	8.116833964093411
1324. there are signs that it has struggled for days to escape	and that in a frenzy of hunger pain and fear it has all but eaten	off its own leg.	9.234232032382986
1325. the attempt failed: the animal is now dead.	8.341215694113531
1326. as we	think of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffered we are	very	likely to say: it was a bad thing that the little animal should	suffer so.	8.510625837032896
1327. the positivist tells us that when we say this we are	only expressing our present emotion.	7.4411082812347225
1328. i hold on the contrary that we	mean to assert something of the pain itself namely that it was bad-	bad when and as it occurred.	10.211940025399086
1329. consider what follows from the	positivist view.	12.161668309955505
1330. on that view nothing good or bad happened in the case	until i came on the scene and made my remark.	10.35351239423101
1331. for what i express	in my remark is something going on in me at the time and that of course	did not exist until i did come on the scene.	6.877796607418832
1332. the pain of the rabbit	was not itself bad; nothing evil was happening when that pain was	being endured; badness in the only sense in which it is involved	at all waited for its appearance till i came and looked and felt.	7.0471158366080555
1333. now	that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows.	5.968604654030783
1334. let	us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene	and that the rabbit never was discovered.	7.126191845416098
1335. are we prepared to say that	in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did?	8.515448268364052
1336. 	clearly not.	15.594944937291627
1337. indeed we should say on the contrary that the accident	of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness	of the animal's pain that it would have been every whit as bad	whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel	repugnance or not.	5.46007231885016
1338. if so then it is clear that in saying the suffering	was bad we are not expressing our feelings only.	13.212564759804785
1339. we are saying that	the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an	attitude toward it.	7.219688575065933
1340. the first argument is thus an ideal experiment	in which we use the method of difference.	11.048057435051081
1341. it removes our present	expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected	by this whereas on positivist grounds it should be.	6.281944763543696
1342. the second argument	applies the method in the reverse way.	11.169842010263045
1343. it ideally removes the past	event and shows that this would render false what we mean to say	whereas on positivist grounds it should not.	6.285690082683112
1344. let us suppose that the	animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all but	that we mistakenly believe it did and say as before that its suffering	was an evil thing.	7.158910930266926
1345. on the positivist theory everything i sought	to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in	the second.	6.924455521964547
1346. in the only sense in which badness is involved at all whatever	was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety since	all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling and that	feeling is still there.	7.490734055108306
1347. and our question is is such an implication	consistent with what we meant?	7.343441585467238
1348.  clearly it is not.	11.928189820845404
1349. if anyone asked	us after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing whether	we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident	had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all we should	say that it made all the difference in the world that what we were	asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred	back there that if this had not occurred there was nothing left to	be bad and that our assertion was in that case mistaken.	4.971295212623237
1350. the suggestion	that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making	no mistake because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about	the past suffering seems to me merely frivolous.	6.828284528631298
1351. if we did not mean	to say this why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering	had not occurred?	7.508544814856821
1352.  on the theory before us such relief would be	groundless for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all	and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved	about.	7.80343428303392
1353. the positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition.	7.43304005989246
1354. so far as i can see there is only one way out for	the positivist.	20.27256580798165
1355. he holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of	approval or disapproval.	7.233226891479716
1356. and there is a way in which he might hold	that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval	without belonging to the pain itself.	12.120643333138174
1357. the pain in itself was neutral;	but unfortunately the rabbit on no grounds at all took up toward	this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for the	first time and in the only intelligible sense bad.	5.548704733651973
1358. this way of escape	is theoretically possible but since it has grave difficulties of	its own and has not so far as i know been urged by positivists it	is perhaps best not to spend time over it.	7.425670445247468
1359. i come now to a third	argument which again is very simple.	7.656668534210395
1360. when we come upon the rabbit	and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing we presumably	make it with some feeling; the positivists are plainly right in	saying that such remarks do usually express feeling.	6.613184097134126
1361. but suppose that	a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement	again.	6.478669021782826
1362. and suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that	the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded.	8.962202089763148
1363. the pathetic evidence is no longer before us; and we are now	so	fatigued in body and mind that feeling is as we say quite dead.	5.747772081675206
1364. in	these circumstances since what was expressed by the remark when first	made is on the theory before us simply absent the remark now expresses	nothing.	6.943964466192859
1365. it is as empty as the word hurrah would be when	there was no enthusiasm behind it.	10.120428910697212
1366. and this seems to me untrue.	29.352099229253493
1367. when	we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing the feeling	with which we made it last week may be at or near the vanishing point	but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before we	should certainly answer yes.	4.710835872769226
1368. we should say that we made our point	with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time	but that it was the same point we were making.	9.5077435902551
1369. and if we can see that	what we meant to say remains the same while the feeling varies from	intensity to near zero it is not the feeling that we primarily meant	to express.	7.537574229451851
1370. i come now to a fourth consideration.	12.626880398769476
1371. we all believe	that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting	and another not; but on the theory before us such a belief would	not make sense.	5.544510884606459
1372. broad and ross have lately contended that this fitness	is one of the main facts of ethics and i suspect they are right.	7.627130553067126
1373. but that is not exactly my point.	20.04813221899233
1374. my point is this: whether there	is such fitness or not we all assume that there is and if we do we	express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do.	8.788314684896072
1375. in his novel the house of the dead dostoevsky	tells of his experiences in a siberian prison camp.	8.410915942656272
1376. whatever	the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today dostoevsky's companions	were about as grim a lot as can be imagined.	6.603224694913559
1377. i have heard	stories he writes of the most terrible the most unnatural actions	of the most monstrous murders told with the most spontaneous	childishly merry laughter.	6.989398233852944
1378. most of us would say that in this delight	at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something	very unfitting.	9.526923153426633
1379. if we were asked why we thought so we should say	that these things involve great evil and are wrong and that to take	delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting.	5.6539799967742805
1380. now on the subjectivist	view this answer is ruled out.	11.441776346785817
1381. for before someone takes	up an attitude toward death suffering or their infliction they have	no moral quality at all.	5.929729974125496
1382. there is therefore nothing about them to which	an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting.	11.072749685673482
1383. they are	in themselves neutral and so far as they get a moral quality they	get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the onlooker.	7.375647301228128
1384. but if that is true why is any attitude more fitting than any	other?	11.22895877731358
1385.  would applause for example be fitting if apart from the	applause there were nothing good to applaud?	6.062397058960812
1386.  would condemnation be	fitting if independently of the condemnation there were nothing bad	to condemn?	8.382575625068137
1387.  in such a case any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting	as any other which means that the notion of fitness has lost	all point.	6.898755097497204
1388. indeed we are forced to go much farther.	12.270278937355695
1389. if goodness	and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being	by them those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry	laughter are taking the only sensible line.	5.314000119439451
1390. if there is nothing evil	in these things if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling	about them why shouldn't they be greeted with a cheer?	9.706282980517644
1391.  to greet	them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something	bad; it would needlessly bring badness into the world; and even	on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright.	5.40205426092399
1392. on the	other hand to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral	into something good; it would bring goodness into the world.	7.753978209307249
1393. the injured german veteran was a former miner twenty-four years	old who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head.	8.055176010039647
1394. this	resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left	side of the cerebellum also.	7.286428797910562
1395. in any event the extraordinary result	of this injury was that he became psychically blind while at	the same time apparently the sense of touch remained essentially intact.	8.238266674411097
1396. psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence	of visual memory-images a condition in which for example one	is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture	of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence.	6.5405366399743325
1397. this circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual	capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its	exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented	by the authors is overwhelming that when the patient closed his eyes	he had absolutely no spatial awareness	whatsoever.	5.153347577022151
1398. the necessary inference as the authors themselves interpret	it would seem to be this:  spatial qualities are not among	those grasped by the sense of touch as such.	8.198056813487872
1399. we do not arrive	at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself.	11.570436899743278
1400. spatiality becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual	representations; that is there is in the true sense only a visual	space.	8.166566807153272
1401. the underlying assumption of course is that only	sight and touch enable us in any precise and fully dependable way to	locate objects in space beyond us the other senses being decidedly inferior	if not totally inadequate in this regard.	4.958391598343503
1402. this is an assumption	with which few would be disposed to quarrel.	13.224849506787775
1403. therefore if the sense	of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence	of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind person when the eyes are closed	and an object is handled the conclusion seems unavoidable that	touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality	of things and that actual sight or visual representations are	necessary.	5.1695071891800115
1404. the force of the authors' analysis	can be felt by the reader i believe only after three	questions have been successfully answered.	7.832328644858158
1405. what allows us to think	that the patient had no third-dimensional representations when his	eyes were closed?	6.374930091531647
1406.  what evidence is there that he was psychically	blind?	13.195968635049278
1407.  how can we be sure that his sense of touch was not profoundly	disturbed by his head injury?	8.489611535864501
1408.  we shall consider these in the	inverse order of their presentation.	12.265526820187853
1409. obviously a satisfactory	answer to the third question is imperative if the argument is to	get under way at all for if there is any possibility of doubt whether	the patient's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital	lesion any findings whatsoever in regard to the first question become	completely ambiguous and fail altogether of course as evidence to	establish the desired conclusion.	5.290912277678595
1410. the answer the authors give to it	therefore is of supreme importance.	12.044144448452037
1411. it is as follows: the usual	sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness	as well as the kinesthetic	sensations	were	as such essentially intact although they seemed in comparison with	normal reactions to be somewhat diminished over the entire body.	6.291470996684294
1412. the	supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient	and his ability to specify the location of a member as well as	the direction and scope of a movement passively executed	proved to have been on the contrary very considerably	affected.	6.681805800004582
1413. the authors insist however that these abnormalities in	the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that	sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained	to the sense of sight.	5.346012869445197
1414. first of all what is their evidence	that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged?	10.549054631422335
1415.  when	an object was placed in the patient's hand he had no difficulty determining	whether it was warm or cold sharp or blunt rough or smooth	flexible soft or hard; and he could tell simply by the feel of	it whether it was made of wood iron cloth rubber and so on.	5.219928071293269
1416. and	he could recognize by touch alone articles which he had handled immediately	before even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and	could not be identified by him; that is he was unaware what kind	of objects they were or what their use was.	6.299198933199174
1417. the patient attained	an astonishing efficiency in a new trade.	9.574052594820632
1418. because of his brain injury	and the extreme damage suffered to his sight the patient had to train	himself for a new line of work that of a portfolio-maker an occupation	requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements	and a fairly well-developed sense of form and contour.	8.51852383809026
1419. it seems clear	when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight	of the patient	second question the one concerning the psychical blindness of the	that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the	usual portfolio-maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably	more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal	vision.	5.9918007265612605
1420. and so the authors conclude: the conduct of the patient	in his every-day life and in his work even more than the foregoing	facts mentioned above under 1 leave positively no room for doubt	that the sense of touch in the ordinary sense of the word was unaffected;	or to put the same thing in physiological terms that the performance-capacity	of the tactual apparatus from the periphery up to	the tactual centers in the brain- that is from one end to the other-	was unimpaired.	7.692307498073053
1421. if the argument is accepted as essentially	sound up to this point it remains for us to consider whether the	patient's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating	objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his defective	visual condition.	5.61887851585444
1422. but before we can do this we must first find	answers to our original questions 1 and 2; then we shall perhaps	be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question	at hand.	8.161297154572086
1423. in what ways then did the patient's psychical	blindness manifest itself?	10.66101787283389
1424.  he could not see objects as unified	self-contained and organized figures as a person does with normal	vision.	10.341068677090052
1425. the meaning of this as we shall see is that he had no fund	of visual memory-images of objects as objects; and therefore he could	not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again.	6.844411718742213
1426. instead	he constantly became lost in parts and components of them confused	some of their details with those of neighboring objects and so	on unless he allowed time to trace the object in question through	minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover	its contours.	6.890469490964571
1427. according to his own testimony he never actually saw things	as shaped but only as generally amorphous blots of color of	a more or less indefinite size; at their edges they slipped pretty	much out of focus altogether.	5.747270502395169
1428. but by the tracing procedure he could	in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner find the unseen form; could	piece as it were the jumbled mass together into an organized whole	and then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned	out to be.	7.630158624283312
1429. if however the figure to be discerned were complicated	composed of several interlocking subfigures and so on even the tracing	process failed him and he could not focus even relatively simple	shapes among its parts.	0.0
1430. this meant concretely that the patient could	not read at all without making writing-like movements of the head or	body became easily confused by hasher marks inserted between hand-written	words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters and	could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing	it.	7.174981641294489
1431. the patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery	at all; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate	him.	7.459773820305406
1432. after a conversation with another man he was able to	recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe	at all what the other man looked like.	9.619966038091068
1433. nor could he call up memory-pictures	of close friends or relatives.	7.118308360432635
1434. in short both his own declarations	and his figural blindness when he looked at objects seem to	present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all.	7.533727914227042
1435. he was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed precisely	because he could not assign it to a visual shape already learned	and held in visual memory as persons of normal vision do.	6.151845692258662
1436. he could	not recognize it; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he	had no visual memory at all.	8.200736707514775
1437. therefore his only recourse was to learn	the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same	individual object or type of object; and this he could do only by	going over its mass with the tracing procedure.	5.18698805348644
1438. then he might finally	recognize it apparently by combining the visual blot actually being	seen with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing	movements.	7.783352347862678
1439. this would mean it can readily be seen that again	for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have to be repeated	because of the absence of visual imagery.	7.121765966612089
1440. as one would	surmise the procedure however could be repeated with the same object	or with the same type of object often enough so that the corresponding	visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would	provide clues as to the actual shape which the patient then immediately	could determine by a kind of inference.	7.347465318148167
1441. men trees automobiles	houses and so on- objects continually confronted in everyday life-	had each its characteristic blot-appearance and became easily recognizable	at the very beginning of tracing by an inference as to what	each was.	4.782427601717655
1442. dice for example he inferred from black dots on a white surface.	7.391013650626644
1443. he evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects	but their size and the dots gave them away.	5.909009505545415
1444. and the authors give	numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient's part to	show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself	and how proficient he became at it.	6.662863642189556
1445. often he seems even to have been	able to guess correctly without the tracing motions solely on the basis	of qualitative differences among the blot-like things which appeared	in his visual experience.	5.190428737797437
1446. perhaps the very important question-	what is then exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the	patient's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing	movements when he is actually looking at things?	8.076113859240523
1447. - has now been	raised in the reader's mind and in the following form.	5.277288353642859
1448. if the patient	can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually	then it would seem the sense of touch has immediate contact	with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations	at least in regard to two dimensions and as we shall see even	this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied	by the authors.	7.800117953792519
1449. how then do the kinesthetic sensations function in	all this?	7.8677709187355696
1450.  the authors set about answering this fundamental question	through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability tactually	to perceive figure and to locate objects in space with his	eyes closed.	6.915848666227844
1451. quite naturally	they make the investigation first by prohibiting the patient from	making any movements at all and then later by repeating it and allowing	the patient to move in any way he wanted to.	5.5423911158436905
1452. when the	patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all the following	striking results occurred.	8.672286564180547
1453. whenever artists indeed turned to actual representations or molded	three-dimensional figures which were rare down to 800 bc they	tended to reflect reality; a schematic	abstract treatment of men and animals by intent rose only in the	late eighth century.	4.560595853257773
1454. to speak of this underlying view of the	world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment.	7.7301584124722975
1455. at the least	however one may conclude that geometric potters sensed a logical order;	their principles of composition stand very close to those which	appear in the homeric epics and the hexameter line.	5.964133532885743
1456. their world again	was a still simple traditional age which was only slowly beginning	to appreciate the complexity of life.	6.873056576178914
1457. and perhaps an observer of the	vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers	and users was basically stable and secure.	5.535330184528866
1458. the storms of the past	had died away and the great upheaval which was to mark the following	century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds.	7.311018707717815
1459. throughout	the work of the later ninth century a calm severe serenity displays	itself.	7.030965030328297
1460. in the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel	one in its internal self-satisfaction but the best of the geometric	pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made	in the greek world.	7.455863291615242
1461. the ninth century was in its artistic work the	spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future	and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a	testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and	was appreciated.	5.173247456563615
1462. geometric pottery	has not yet received the thorough detailed study which it	deserves	partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some	of its local manifestations as at argos are only now coming to light.	5.8429768720186015
1463. from even a cursory inspection of its many aspects however the	historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress	of the aegean world down to 800 bc   the general intellectual	outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated	to a significant degree.	4.837424933957377
1464. much which was in embryo in 1000	had become reasonably well developed by 800.	8.30113943624519
1465. in this process the minoan-mycenaean	inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected;	the aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that	which	rises more clearly in our vision after 800.	5.881478577874554
1466. those modern scholars	who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of aegean	development from earliest times- granted occasional irruptions of	peoples and ideas from outside- are correct; but all too many observers	have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change	which took place in the early first millennium.	7.046926684865647
1467. the focus	of novelty in this world now lay in the south-eastern districts of	the	greek mainland and by 800 virtually the entire aegean always excepting	its northern shores had accepted the geometric style of pottery.	5.4147442380388755
1468. while protogeometric vases usually turn up especially outside greece	proper together with as many or more examples of local stamp these	non-greek	patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century.	6.215959203217916
1469. in their place came local variations within the common style-	tentative as it were in protogeometric products but truly distinct	and sharply defined as the geometric spirit developed.	5.963087912880838
1470. attica	though important was not the only teacher of this age.	10.199045301202903
1471. one can take	a vase of about 800 bc and without any knowledge of its place	of origin venture to assign it to a specific area; imitation and borrowing	of motifs now become ascertainable.	5.761308961377743
1472. the potters of the aegean	islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland and in greece	itself argive corinthian attic boeotian and other geometric	sequences have each their own hallmarks.	7.150273158334768
1473. these local variations were	to become ever sharper in the next century and a half.	6.880944114051817
1474. the same	conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the dark	ages from linguistic distribution and from the survivals of early	social political and religious patterns into later ages.	7.401229121130267
1475. by 800 bc	the aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture.	6.521322125807565
1476. on these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which	was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the iliad.	7.238599081909383
1477. everywhere within the common pattern however one finds local	diversity; greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized	and plagued by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors.	5.026336780800867
1478. further we cannot go for the dark ages deserve their	name.	8.48113929740002
1479. many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized	to find expression nor could the simple economic and social foundations	of this world support a lofty structure.	5.697294892059446
1480. the epic poems the	consolidation of the greek pantheon the rise of firm political units	the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations	of men- all these had to await the progress of following decades.	6.773815154849202
1481. what we have seen in this chapter we have seen only dimly and	yet the results however general are worth the search.	7.878998474365192
1482. these are	the centuries in which the inhabitants of the aegean world settled firmly	into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the	hellenic outlook independent of outside forces.	6.815549445754595
1483. to interpret	indeed the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation	may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed	information; if we could see more deeply we probably would find	many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the	period.	4.9264434793706275
1484. the historian can only point out those lines which were major	enough to find reflection in our limited evidence and must hope that	future excavations will enrich our understanding.	6.453426237206616
1485. throughout the dark	ages it is clear the greek world had been developing slowly but	consistently.	8.121231513790214
1486. the pace could now be accelerated for the inhabitants	of the aegean stood on firm ground.	8.003498092197411
1487. the landscape of greek history broadens widely and	rather abruptly in the eighth century bc the age of homer's	rosy-fingered dawn.	6.6135937836147
1488. the first slanting rays of the new day	cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the aegean world;	but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more	unmistakably some of the lines of change.	7.417974433639382
1489. for this period as for earlier	centuries pottery remains the most secure source; the ceramic	material of the age is more abundant more diversified and more indicative	of the hopes and fears of its makers who begin to show scenes of	human life and death.	5.06241439611083
1490. figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence	of sculpture and architecture in greece; objects in gold	ivory	and bronze grow more numerous.	6.44893033609597
1491. since writing was practiced in the	aegean before the end of the century we may hope that the details of	tradition will now be occasionally useful.	7.941244313576755
1492. though it is not easy to	apply the evidence of the iliad to any specific era this marvelous	product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape	by 750.	8.800064024108055
1493. the dipylon geometric pottery of athens and the iliad	are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of greek	civilization; but both were among the last products of a phase	which was ending.	5.1258360333252
1494. greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution	in which the developed qualities of the hellenic outlook were	suddenly to break forth.	6.637209929101421
1495. the revolution was well under way before	700 bc and premonitory signs go back virtually across the century.	6.726009350745573
1496. the era however is janus-faced.	13.848082117783294
1497. while many tokens point forward	the main achievements stand as a culmination of the simple patterns	of the dark ages.	5.640234305531537
1498. the dominant pottery of the century was geometric;	political organization revolved about the basileis;	trade	was just beginning to expand; the gods who protected the greek countryside	were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress.	6.6898948707734744
1499. the modern student who knows what was to come next is likely	to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth	century.	5.565331198642477
1500. not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis.	13.785437300674355
1501. many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted	with radically new ideas; the poet of the iliad deliberately	archaized.	6.982078179306438
1502. although it is not possible to sunder old and new	in this era i shall consider in the present chapter primarily the	first	decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee	of the first stage of greek civilization.	7.981602771143404
1503. on this principle	of division i must postpone the evolution of sculpture architecture	society and politics; for the developments in these areas make sense	only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself.	6.012785356369535
1504. the growing	contacts between aegean and orient are also a phase which should	be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of hellenic culture	after 750.	7.103179321311508
1505. we shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections	to the east as we consider ripe geometric pottery the epic	and the myth and the religious evolution of early greece; the important	point however is that these magnificent achievements unlike those	of later decades were only incidentally influenced by oriental	models.	5.431519492104782
1506. the antecedents of dipylon vases and of the iliad lie in	the aegean past.	9.469172564136413
1507. the pottery of the first	half of the eighth century is commonly called ripe geometric.	6.932178049483514
1508. the	severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years the strong	geometric style of the late ninth century display as firm a mastery	of the principles underlying geometric pottery; but artists now were	ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance.	6.027996204038015
1509. the vases which resulted	had different shapes far more complex decoration and a larger	sense of style.	6.196120048044738
1510. beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of	this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader	lines.	6.945345300274609
1511. in earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding	a fundamental sense of order after chaos.	7.879836024405837
1512. they had had to work on very	simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses.	10.020058785614506
1513. the	potters in particular had virtually eschewed freehand drawing elaborate	motifs and the curving lines of nature while yet expressing a	belief that there was order in the universe.	5.11429832726188
1514. in their vases were embodied	the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of greek civilization	at first hesitantly in protogeometric work and then more confidently	in the initial stages of the geometric style.	7.097741880663101
1515. by 800 social	and cultural security had been achieved at least on a simple plane;	it was time to take bigger steps to venture on experiments.	5.633991441985808
1516. ripe	geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments	and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of	motifs which they had inherited.	7.176868875855017
1517. in these respects the vases of the early	eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress.	6.683177069989069
1518. to the ancestral lore however new materials were added.	11.76952159091141
1519. painters	left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color; instead they	divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns	into which freehand drawing began to creep.	4.7961335652028625
1520. wavy lines feather-like	patterns rosettes of indefinitely floral nature birds either singly	or in stylized rows animals in solemn frieze bands-	all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary	signs that the potters were broadening their gaze.	6.22998845547813
1521. the rows of animals	and birds in particular suggest awareness of oriental animal friezes	transmitted perhaps via syrian silver bowls and textiles but the	specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are	nonetheless greek.	4.802357795086472
1522. though the spread of this type of decoration in the	aegean has not yet been precisely determined it seems to appear first	in the cyclades which were among the leading exporters of pottery	throughout the century.	8.65160503175289
1523. as the material at the command of the	potters grew and the volume of their production increased the local	variations within a common style became more evident.	6.758901611179321
1524. plate 12 illustrates	four examples which are ripe or late geometric work of common	spirit but of different schools.	6.643215071337043
1525. cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and	when he could not show the hide arrested him.	5.857526863129048
1526. thinking the evidence	insufficient to get a conviction he later released him.	8.443393651209309
1527. even while suffering	the trip to his home cook swore to moore and lane that he	would kill the indian.	6.129185436985127
1528. three weeks later following his recovery	armed with a writ issued by the catskill justice on affidavits prepared	by the district attorney cook and russell rode to arrest martinez.	6.508544118114881
1529. arriving at daybreak they found julio in his corral and demanded	that he surrender.	5.947098824708746
1530. instead he whirled and ran to his house for	a gun forcing them to kill him cook reported.	8.502722757247785
1531. both cook's	and russell's lives were threatened by the mexicans following the	killing but the company officers felt that in the end it would serve	to quiet them despite their immediate emotion.	6.057620752132065
1532. general manager pels	even suggested that it might be wise to keep the mexicans in suspense	rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away and try	to have a few punished.	6.824020722901343
1533. on february 17 russell and cook	were sent to the pena flor community on the vermejo to see about renting	out ranches the company had purchased.	5.871290491689238
1534. while talking with julian	m beall francisco archuleta and juan marcus appeared both	heavily armed and after watching the house for a while rode away.	8.102320724118668
1535. it was nearly sundown before they finished the business with beall and	began riding down the stream.	7.905462152810838
1536. they had traveled only a short distance	when they spotted five mexicans riding along a horse-trail across	the stream just ahead of them.	7.973594027949788
1537. suspecting an ambush the two deputies	decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into catskill.	5.15576524365156
1538. after spending two nights in catskill	the deputies again headed for the vermejo to finish their business.	8.636934852609928
1539. they stayed with a rancher friday night and by eleven o'clock	saturday morning passed the old garnett lee ranch.	6.167907030019931
1540. half a mile below	at the mouth of salyer's canyon was an old ranch that the company	had purchased from a j armstrong occupied by a mexican	his wife and an old trapper.	8.249126216127896
1541. there were three houses in salyer's	canyon just at the foot of a low bluff the road winding along the top	entering above and then passing down in front of the houses thence	to the vermejo.	6.860402501824046
1542. to the west of this road was another low bluff forty	or fifty feet high covered with scrub oak and other brush.	8.639477047078552
1543. as they	were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the	two bluffs a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers.	5.319475204457148
1544. not a bullet touched cook who was nearer the ambush but one	hit russell in the leg and another broke his arm passing on through	his body.	7.217988580009604
1545. with the first reports russell's horse wheeled	to the right and ran towards the buildings while cook followed by a	hail of bullets raced towards the arroyo of salyer's canyon immediately	in front of him just reaching it as his horse fell.	5.6398411999174005
1546. grabbing	his winchester from its sheath cook prepared to fight from behind	the arroyo bank.	7.198778874655976
1547. bullets were so thick throwing sand in his face that	he found it difficult to return the fire.	5.475368239469199
1548. noticing russell's horse	in front of the long log building he assumed his friend had slipped	inside and would be able to put up a good fight so he began working	his way down the ditch to join him.	7.288400213494972
1549. at a very shallow place two mexicans	rushed into the open for a shot.	8.178036018227619
1550. dropping to one knee cook	felled one and the other struggled off with his comrade sending no further	fire in his direction.	7.60822696835822
1551. just before leaving the arroyo where he	was partially concealed he did hear shots down at the house.	7.118009902851495
1552. russell had reached the house as cook surmised dismounted but just	as the old trapper opened the door to receive him he fell into the trapper's	arms- dead.	6.656304016967121
1553. a bullet fired by one of the mexicans hiding	in a little chicken house had passed through his head tearing a hole	two-inches square on the outgoing side.	5.852203420596012
1554. finding him dead cook caught	russell's horse and rode to the cattle foreman's house to report	the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins.	6.224411152267093
1555. before daylight sunday morning a posse of twenty-three men under	the leadership of deputy sheriff frank macpherson of catskill followed	the trail to the house of francisco chaves where 100 to 150	mexicans had gathered.	5.496482868596408
1556. macpherson boldly approached the fortified	adobe house and demanded entrance.	8.196044167676531
1557. the men inside informed him that they	had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see	them even though he offered medical aid.	8.23308020862287
1558. the officer demanded the names	of the injured men; the mexicans not only refused to give them	but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it.	6.595236728929305
1559. since	the strength of the mexicans had been underrated too small a posse	had been collected and since the deputy had not been provided with	search warrants macpherson and his men decided it was much wiser to	withdraw.	5.188764866452444
1560. the posse's retreat encouraged the mexicans to	be overbearing and impudent.	9.430036403335416
1561. during the following week six tons of hay	belonging to one rancher were burned; some buildings farm tools	two horses plows and hay owned by bonito lavato a friendly interpreter	for the company and pedro chavez' hay were stolen or destroyed;	and a store was broken into and robbed.	5.120464087512787
1562. district attorney m	w mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught	committing these crimes or carrying arms- he just didn't catch	anyone.	6.902202699322327
1563. increasing threats on his life finally convinced cook	that he should leave new mexico.	5.761555547031071
1564. his friends advised that it would	be only a question of time until either the mexicans killed him by	ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense perpetuating	the troubles.	7.0217872108372275
1565. by early summer he wrote from laramie that he	was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in a bad	way financially so pels sent him a draft for $100 warning that it	was still not wise for him to return.	5.2521212721999255
1566. pels also sent a check for $100	to russell's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his	grave.	6.798076821904667
1567. cattle stealing and killing again serious during the	spring of 1891 placed the land grant company officers in a perplexing	position.	5.3857728005229974
1568. they were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property	thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on	the vermejo and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary	for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot.	7.4229825789676
1569. and	the law virtually ignored the situation.	7.746395066640683
1570. the judge became ill just as	the colfax district court convened no substitute was brought in	no criminal cases heard only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried	and court adjourned sine die after sitting a few days instead of the usual	three weeks.	6.530699070126721
1571. pels complained: litigants and witnesses were	put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact	business; public money spent; justice delayed; nothing accomplished	and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to	be an absolute farce.	4.647150841837471
1572. word reached the company that the man	behind these depredations was manuel gonzales a man with many followers	including a number who were kept in line through fear of him.	7.3663227432260205
1573. although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old man named asher jones	the warrant for his arrest had never been served.	5.933418473101486
1574. on may 19 a	deputy sheriff's posse of eight men left maxwell city and rode thirty-five	miles up the vermejo where they were joined by juan jose	martinez.	8.1829438594255
1575. by 3:00 am they reached his house and found it vacant.	8.830844762089015
1576. when they were refused entrance to his brother's house nearby	they smashed down the door broke the window and threw lighted clothes	wet with kerosene into the room.	7.435844098371478
1577. still there was no gonzales and	the family would say nothing.	8.634279813656036
1578. about 300 yards up the creek was	a cluster of mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a	square.	8.341340390614565
1579. while prowling around these buildings two of the posse recognized	the voice of gonzales speaking to the people inside.	6.797467701440585
1580. he was promised	that no harm would befall him if he would come out but he cursed	and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door.	8.492087679747664
1581. the	posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building	would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him	dead or alive.	5.422556600741444
1582. in deadly earnest the besiegers methodically	stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags	inside only to have most stamped out by the women as soon as they hit	the floor.	7.3079661704494505
1583. when it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer	taking a thousand to one chance gonzales rushed outside square against	the muzzle of a winchester.	6.323336067345265
1584. shot near the heart he turned to	one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away three	bullets following him.	6.921217574523595
1585. as he pushed open the door he fell on his	face one of his comrades pulling him inside.	7.861733841126591
1586. not realizing the	seriousness of the wound the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender	the house would be burned down around him.	8.407415323559801
1587. receiving no answer	they set the fire.	7.622507342753323
1588. when the house was about half consumed his comrade	ran to the door and threw up his hands declaring repeatedly that	he did not know the whereabouts of manuel.	8.598621483440365
1589. finding it true that he	was not inside the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes	through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed	covered by a blanket.	5.714023997855092
1590. several slugs fired into the bed jerked aside	the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand.	7.407107524233722
1591. shot six or eight	times the body was draped with russell's pistol belt and cartridges.	5.959119080209658
1592. there was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who though	numbering in the fifties had stood around on the hillside nearby	without firing a shot during the entire attack.	9.677203143613418
1593. early the next	morning a mexican telephoned pels that celso chavez one of the	posse members was surrounded by ten mexicans at his father's home	on the upper vermejo.	5.351971181719254
1594. the sheriff and district attorney mills	hastily swore	out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed	according to signed statements by chavez and dr i p george	and ordered deputy barney clark of raton to rescue the posseman.	6.7537453183770895
1595. traveling all night clark and twelve men arrived at about seven	o'clock may 22.	5.725106139771221
1596. occasionally they heard gun-shot signals and a	number of horsemen were sighted on the hills disappearing at the posse's	approach.	7.487708292793125
1597. a mexican justice of the peace had issue a writ against	chavez for taking part in the murder of manuel gonzales	so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger.	7.54260211294121
1598. the men	helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to raton along	with three other families desiring to leave.	7.333060553020843
1599. the ten or more	dangerous parties singled out for prosecution were still at large and	pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe	houses defending themselves through loopholes it would be most difficult	to capture them.	5.2356598059063675
1600. thus he wired j p lower and sons of	denver: have you any percussion hand grenades for throwing in a	house or across a well loaded with balls or shrapnel shot?	6.42698075235119
1601.  if not	how long to order and what is the price?	11.127374728485375
1602.  he wisely decided that	it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup	particularly since the mexicans were on their guard.	7.5434713225101095
1603. his problem	then became one of restraining the american fighters who wanted to clean	out the vermejo by force immediately.	6.366315086709718
1604. the plant was located west of the battenkill and south of the location	of the former electric light plant.	8.992672818145518
1605. the manchester depot	sewer company issued 214 shares of stock at $10 each for construction	of a sewer in that locality and assessments were made for its maintenance.	5.1400253740636375

1615. the 1958 town meeting directed town authorities to seek federal	and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed	sewage plant with its attendant facilities.	5.59658091176633
1616. the final step was a	vote	for a $230000 bond issue for the construction of a sewage system by	the 1959 town meeting later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special	town meeting june 21 1960.	6.662708931992104
1617. there the matter stands with	the prospect that soon manchester may be removed from the roster of	towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams.	7.204156457122857
1618. telegraph	manchester's unusual interest in telegraphy has	often been attributed to the fact that the rev j d wickham	headmaster of burr and burton seminary was a personal friend and	correspondent of the inventor samuel f b morse.	7.66893264748424
1619. at any	rate manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system	which was set up in 1844 between baltimore and washington.	6.275758069063542
1620. in	1846 matthew b goodwin jeweler and watchmaker became the town's	first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business	two doors north of the equinox house or one door north	of the bank manchester vermont.	6.171520640387803

1624. by 1871 l c orvis	manager of the western union telegraph company expressed	willingness to send emergency telegrams on sundays from his village	drugstore.	7.153027105642105
1625. orvis even needed to hire an assistant clark j wait.	6.210871206873012
1626. the manchester journal commented editorially on the surprising	amount of local telegraphic business.	8.649006242526841
1627. in the fall of 1878	the popular telegraph line was established between manchester	and factory point by the owners paul w orvis henry gray	j n hard and clark j wait.	6.654604015167823
1628. the line soon lived up	to its name as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a	dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends	on its capital stock.	6.65745493441558
1629. in 1879 the same clark wait with h	h holley of south dorset formed the american telegraph	line extending from manchester depot via factory point and	south dorset to dorset.	5.312532867322121
1630. besides being most convenient the line soon	proved a good investment for the owners.	7.814182100863163
1631. telegraphers at the	depot at this time were aaron c burr and mark manley of burr	and manley dealers in lumber and dry goods.	5.503386313631937
1632. early equipment	was very flimsy; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles	making communications impossible.	8.963416206156325
1633. but companies continued to spring	up.	12.754707820148809
1634. by 1883 the battenkill telegraph company was in existence	and alvin pettibone was its president.	7.850190528484775
1635. operating in 1887 was the	valley telegraph line officers of which were e c orvis	president; h k fowler vice-president and secretary;	j n hard treasurer; f h walker superintendent;	h s walker assistant superintendent.	4.868358237401049

1637. operators were arthur koop and	norman	taylor.	8.254441635698543
1638. still existing on a northern union telegraph form	is a typical peremptory message from peru grocer j j hapgood	to burton and graves' store in manchester- get and send	by stage sure four pounds best porterhouse or serloin stake for mrs	hapgood send six sweet oranges.	5.763867264603636
1639. about 1888 j e	mcnaughton of barnumville and e g bacon became proprietors	of the green mountain telegraph company connecting all offices	on the western union line and extending over the mountain from	barnumville to peru londonderry south londonderry lowell lake	windham north windham grafton cambridgeport saxton's	river and bellows falls.	4.48344081196359

1641. the village office of western union	with george towsley as manager and telegrapher continued in hard's	drugstore until 1905.	5.902564164932943
1642. during the summers towsley often needed	the assistance of a company operator.	12.444739627302019
1643. these were the years when	people flocked to manchester not only to play golf which had come	into vogue but also to witness the ekwanok country club tournaments.	6.066026152480751
1644. new yorkers were kept informed of scores by reporters who telegraphed	fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers.	7.200512570764348
1645. this boosted local telegraph business and manchester basked in	all the free advertising.	6.954879689604739
1646. in 1914 when the town was chosen for the	u s amateur golf tournament a representative hurried here from	the boston manager's office.	7.727822897565601
1647. in his wake came the district traffic	supervisor and the cream of the telegraphic profession ten of	boston's best chosen for their long experience and thorough knowledge	of golf.	5.64245094933822
1648. during that tournament alone some 250000 words winged	their way out of manchester.	11.433714500764301

1651. she was succeeded by clarence goyette.	11.92992468941445
1652. since	that time the telegraph office has shifted in location from the railroad	station at the depot and shops at the center back to the town clerk's	office and drugstore at the village.	7.519080398299627
1653. after being located for	some years in the village at the equinox pharmacy under the supervision	of mrs harry mercier it is presently located in the hill	and dale shop manchester center.	6.320270702148634
1654. the first known telephone	line in manchester was established in july 1883 between burr and	manley's store at manchester depot and the kent and root marble	company in south dorset.	6.891639305732946
1655. this was extended the following year	to include the railroad station agent's office and thayer's hotel	at factory point.	6.679029513865414

1659. these must have been	for local calls strictly as in may 1900 the only long distance	telephone in town was transferred from c b carleton's to	young's shoe store.	5.005794569219594
1660. a small single switchboard was installed	in the village over woodcock's hardware store	.	9.058408794348596
1661. george woodcock was manager and troubleshooter;	elizabeth way was the first operator; and a night operator was also	employed.	6.043013632325737
1662. anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phones	advertised the fact along with the telephone number in the manchester	journal.	8.989074456028128
1663. in 1918 the new england telephone company	began erecting a building to house its operations on the corner of u	s rte 7 and what is now memorial avenue at manchester center.	6.119711977783284
1664. service running through barnumville and to bennington county	towns east of the mountains was in the hands of the gleason telephone	company in 1925 but major supervision of telephone lines	in manchester was with the new england telephone and telegraph company	which eventually gained all control.	8.068255991000015
1665. more aerial and underground	equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care	of the expanding business.	6.768731214709255

1669. in 1932 dorset received its own exchange	which made business easier for the manchester office but it was	not until february 1953 that area service was extended to include manchester	and dorset.	5.351049744512415
1670. this eliminated toll calls between the two towns.	12.52498293278141
1671. within a month calls were up seventy per cent.	9.119662490149233
1672. power	electricity plays such an important part in community life	today that it is difficult to envision a time when current was not	available for daily use.	8.117106755323983
1673. yet one has to go back only some sixty years.	8.630527772736395
1674. the first mention of an electric plant in manchester seems	to be one installed in reuben colvin's and houghton's gristmill	on the west branch in factory point.	7.07368542005431
1675. no records are available as	to the date or extent of installation but it may have been in 1896.	7.47862430515581
1676. on june 14 1900 the manchester journal reported that	an electrical engineer was installing an electric light plant for edward	s isham at ormsby hill.	7.223712375579748
1677. this was working by the end	of august and giving satisfactory service.	8.438845311202073
1678. in november 1900	surveying was done under john marsden on the east mountains to ascertain	if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate	an electric power plant.	8.082414837682888
1679. nothing came of it perhaps due to lack of	opportunity for water storage.	6.389243502986665
1680. the next step was construction	by the manchester light and power company of a plant on the west	bank of the battenkill south of union street bridge.	7.265961278961862
1681. this was nearly	completed may 23 1901 with a promise of lights by june 10 but	the first light did not go on until september 28.	5.943133449088754
1682. it was at the end	of the sidewalk in front of the dellwood cemetery cottage.	17.656095976850317
1683. the	first directors of the manchester light and power company were	john marsden m l manley william f orvis george smith	and john blackmer.	5.3997984678994015
1684. the officers were john marsden president;	john c blackmer vice-president; george smith treasurer;	and william f orvis secretary.	8.040138836822692
1685. marsden was manager of the	company for ten years and manager of its successor company the colonial	light and power company for one year.	5.4893721757971
1686. at about the time	the marsden enterprise was getting under way the vail light and	lumber company started construction of a chair stock factory on the	site of the present bennington co-operative creamery intending to	use its surplus power for generating electricity.	6.530492157315557
1687. manchester then had	two competing power companies until 1904 when the manchester light	and power company purchased the transmission system of the vail	company.	4.958070100322966
1688. this was fortunate as the vail plant burned in 1905.	11.350691961998146
1689. the colonial light and power company was succeeded by the vermont	hydro-electric corporation which in turn was absorbed by the	central vermont public service corporation.	5.852546799710591
1690. the latter now furnishes	the area with electricity distributed from a modern sub-station at	manchester depot which was put into operation february 19 1930 and	was improved in january 1942 by the installation of larger transformers.	6.601821037808512
1691. for a time following the abandonment of the local plant	electric current for manchester was brought in from the south with	an emergency tie-in with the vermont marble company system to the north.	6.769365940609563
1692. some who have written on utopia have treated it as a learned	diversion of a learned world a phantasy with which more amused	himself a holiday work a spontaneous overflow of intellectual	high spirits a revel of debate paradox comedy and invention.	6.093656081597252
1693. with	respect to this view two points are worth making.	7.187365013754166
1694. first it appears	to be based on the fact that on its title page utopia is described	as festivus gay.	10.304233160642921
1695. it overlooks the other fact that	it is described as nec minus salutaris quam festivus no	less salutary than gay.	6.853641928480741
1696. it also overlooks the fact that in a rational	lexicon and quite clearly in more's lexicon the opposite of	serious is not gay but frivolous and the opposite of gay is not serious	but solemn.	8.395362613648137
1697. more believed that a man could be both serious and gay.	7.849247445858565
1698. that a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional	illusion sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly	believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because	they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode	of expression their authors are capable of.	6.603967255903179
1699. secondly to find a learned	diversion and a pleasing joke in more's account of the stupid	brutalities of early sixteenth century wars of the anguish of the poor	and dispossessed of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful	requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising	in a moral imbecile and most surprising in more himself.	4.800773437968194
1700. indeed	it is even surprising in the canon of christ church and regius	professor of ecclesiastical history who fathered this most peculiar	view and in the brilliant professor of medieval and renaissance	english at cambridge who inherited it and is now its most eminent	proponent.	5.943773571418687
1701. but to return to the main line of our inquiry.	13.421664945931663
1702. it	is doubtful that utopia is still widely read because more was medieval	or even because he was a martyr- indeed it is likely that these	days many who read utopia with interest do not even know that	its author was a martyr.	6.910725142464559
1703. utopia is still widely read because in	a sense more stood on the margin of modernity.	6.051743225543437
1704. and if he did stand	on the margins of modernity it was not in dying a martyr for such unity	as papal supremacy might be able to force on western christendom.	9.251469489427912
1705. it was not even in writing latin epigrams sometimes bawdy ones or	in translating lucian from greek into latin or in defending the study	of greek against the attack of conservative academics or in attacking	the conservative theologians who opposed erasmus's philological	study of the new testament.	5.696840260430347
1706. similar literary exercises were the	common doings of a christian humanist of the first two decades of the	sixteenth century.	8.129844902668426
1707. had more's writings been wholly limited to such	exercises they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen	or so other authors living in his time whose works tenuously survive	in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit	of their very specialized occasions read those works.	5.221902990449824
1708. more	stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone- because he	wrote utopia.	7.810415301301886
1709. and the evidence that he does indeed stand there	derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual	readers have responded to that book for the past century or so.	6.598230546198967
1710. only one other contemporary of more's evokes so immediate and direct	a response and only one other contemporary work- niccolo machiavelli	and the prince.	7.72117502115348
1711. can we discover what it is in utopia	that has evoked this response?	10.193745589788241
1712.  remember that in seeking the modern	in utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the renaissance	there; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing	on the same inconceivable	scale the relative importance of the medieval the	renaissance and the modern.	6.387172903026784
1713. the medieval was the most important	to chambers because he sought to place thomas more the author of	utopia in some intelligible relation with st thomas more	the martyr.	5.588703887562494
1714. to others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance	of christian humanism the renaissance elements are of primary	concern.	8.316142821001927
1715. but here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation; we want	to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has; we want	to know what is perennially new about utopia.	6.126180134758616
1716. what is new	about it?	22.677757618045387
1717.  to that question the answer is simple; it can be made	in two words utopian communism.	7.828780270395683
1718. but it is an answer which opens the	door wide to an onrush of objections and denials.	13.105269881877826
1719. surely there is nothing	new about communism.	7.7953810700046535
1720. we find it in plato's republic and	in utopia more acknowledges his debt to that book.	9.876981374156989
1721. we find it	in that common way of life h pleasing to christ and h still in	use among the truest societies of christians that is the better	monasteries which made it easier to convert the utopians to	christianity.	6.69141149634059
1722. we find it in the later stoic conception of man's natural condition	which included the community of all possessions.	10.799726421724195
1723. this conception	was taken up by the early church fathers and by canon lawyers and	theologians in the middle ages; and more was far too well read not	to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it.	6.081027325038086
1724. but although the idea of communism is very old even in more's	day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 it	is not communism as such that we are concerned with.	7.325496292403985
1725. we are concerned	not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus:	platonic stoic early christian monastic canonist or theological	communism; we are concerned with utopian communism- that is simply	communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of utopia	as more conceived it.	4.982088086722686
1726. perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity	of utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier	types of communistic theory.	8.549480168129186
1727. we will achieve a more vivid sense	of what it is by realizing what it is not.	10.730475444439154
1728. in plato's republic	communism is- to speak anachronistically- a communism of janissaries.	9.047975442535272
1729. its function is to separate from the base ruled mass among	whom private ownership prevails the governing warrior elite.	5.650746150781882
1730. moreover	it is too readily forgotten that in the republic what	gave	the initial impetus to plato's excursus into the construction of an	imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods wives	and children was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of	the individual human psyche; and it is to this problem that the republic	ultimately returns.	6.674330339536156
1731. in more's utopia communism is not	a means of separating out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass.	6.293307836623727
1732. utopian	communism applies to all utopians.	11.624761621269448
1733. and in the economy of the	book it is not peripheral but central.	13.71127166671565
1734. the concern of utopia is	with the optimo reipublicae statu the best ordering of a civil society;	and it is again and again made clear that utopian communism	provides the institutional array indispensible to that best ordering.	6.790628496489725
1735. to derive utopian communism from the jerusalem christian community	of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors-in-spirit	the monastic communities is with an appropriate shift of adjectives	misleading in the same way as to derive it from plato's republic:	in the republic we have to do with an elite of physical	and intellectual athletes in the apostolic and monastic communities with	an elite of spiritual and religious athletes.	5.240320169558137
1736. the apostolic community	was literally an elite: chosen by christ himself.	9.430036403335416
1737. and the monastic	communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only	after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic	rigors their spiritual athleticism.	6.985223359130126
1738. finally the conception	of the natural community of all possessions which originated	with the stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by more's time although	it was not accepted by all the theologian-philosophers of the	middle ages.	6.0352088719041825
1739. in that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in	the age of innocence before the fall of man.	7.4489019043886096
1740. it did not serve to	contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order	because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man	had sinned.	8.558893150584547
1741. the actual function of patristic-civilian-canonist-scholastic	communism was adequately set forth by st gregory almost a	millenium before more wrote utopia.	5.8855750083716
1742. the soil is common	to all men h.	11.958446886300605
1743. when we give the necessities of life to the poor	we restore to them what is already theirs.	8.779267424699814
1744. we should think of it more	as an act of justice than compassion.	13.756933105628148
1745. because community not	severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely	unalterable right to what is his.	7.682065645336881
1746. indeed of all that is his every	man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated	to regard himself as a custodian.	9.610874702553993
1747. he is a trustee for the common good	however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of	property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund	wisely or unwisely entrusted to his keeping.	6.086671158878822
1748. in contrast to this	stoic-patristic view utopia implies that the nature of man is such	that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of	municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness	in a sieve.	8.095617244393683
1749. the utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions.	8.976097203071156
1750. in	a properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the	function which in natural law theory ineptly is left altogether to	a small voice so often still.	6.134376786444851
1751. in all the respects just	indicated	utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community	of possessions and living plays a role.	7.19656741681345
1752. neither from one of these	conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced.	10.583829172177266
1753. we do	not deny originality to the agamemnon because aeschylus found the	tales of the house of atreus among the folk lore of the greeks.	6.990318931704133
1754. in	a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may	find in it utopian communism remains as an integral whole original-	a new thing.	6.5062665218547036
1755. it is not merely a new thing; it is one of the very	few new things in utopia; most of the rest is medieval or humanist	or part of an old tradition of social criticism.	8.85407928288562
1756. but to say that	at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say	that it is modern; and for this statement the best evidence comes	within the five years following the publication of utopia when	martin luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the divine's	encounter with man.	7.218971680341956
1757. new indeed is luther's perception but	not modern as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible	to modern students what luther was getting at.	5.316736446672056
1758. although utopian	communism is both new in 1516 and also modern it is not modern communism	or even modern socialism as they exist or have ever existed in	theory or in practice.	6.7355149487724075
1759. consider the features of utopian communism:	generous public provision for the infirm; democratic and secret elections	of all officers including priests meals taken publicly in common	refectories; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens;	even houses changed once a decade; six hours of manual labor	a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars and careful measures	to prevent anyone from shirking; no private property no money;	no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services and therefore	no market in the economic sense of the term.	4.497430251962994
1760. whatever the merits of	its intent utopian communism is far too naive far too crude to suit	any modern socialist or communist.	7.203780624792659
1761. it is not the details of utopian	communism that make utopia modern it is the spirit the attitude	of mind that informs those details.	9.843276045140588
1762. what that spirit and attitude	were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts	with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history the	one which reached christianity by the way of stoicism through the	church fathers of late antiquity.	6.696539786370663
1763. during the dorr trial the democratic press condemned the proceedings	and heralded dorr as a martyr to the principles of the declaration	of independence.	7.001334280461251
1764. during the brown trial however the state's	most powerful democratic newspaper the providence daily post	stated that brown was a murderer a man of blood and that he and	his associates with the assistance of republicans and abolitionists	had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow	of state and federal governments.	7.406407422726786
1765. the providence daily journal	answered the daily post by stating that the raid of john	brown was characteristic of democratic acts of violence and that he	was acting in direct opposition to the republican party who proclaim	as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere	with slavery in the states.	5.654446132520343
1766. the two major newspapers in providence	continued throughout the crisis to accuse each other of misrepresenting	the facts and attempting to falsify history.	7.508653903448094
1767. while the	daily post continued to accuse republicans and the daily journal	continued to accuse democrats the woonsocket patriot complained	that the virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly	haste to condemn brown and his men.	4.78552257252053
1768. editor foss stated of their	guilt h there can be no doubt h but they are entitled to sufficient	time to prepare for trial and h a fair trial.	0.0
1769. the providence	daily post thought that there were probably good reasons for	the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing	gained by a delay would be calmer feelings.	6.29375376296826
1770. the providence daily	journal stated that although the guilt of brown was evident the	south must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace.	7.403948156801749
1771. on october 31 1859 john brown was found guilty of treason	against the state of virginia inciting slave rebellion and murder.	6.8365422417799415
1772. for these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in public on friday	december 2 1859.	9.850008953398907
1773. upon receiving the news northern writers editors	and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the southern states	particularly virginia.	5.602530471305461
1774. although rhode islanders were preparing	for the state elections they watched john brown's trial with	extreme interest.	7.7788803119653105
1775. on wednesday morning november 2 1859 the providence	daily journal stated that although brown justly deserved	the extreme penalty no man however criminal ought to suffer the penalty	without a fairer trial.	5.166550092484673
1776. the editor's main criticism of the trial	was the haste with which it was conducted.	10.505052883989906
1777. the readers of the providence	daily post however learned that it was generally conceded	that old brown had a fair trial.	6.41675664931855
1778. concerning the sentence	the editor asked what else can virginia do than to hang the men	who have	defied her laws organized treason and butchered her citizens.	6.09983039226678
1779. in the eastern section of the state the newspapers' reaction	to brown's trial and sentence were basically identical.	9.471559271359766
1780. j	wheaton smith editor of the warren telegraph stated that the	ends of justice must be satisfied a solitary example must be set	in order that all those misnamed philantropists sic who actuated	by a blind zeal dare to instigate riot treason and murder may	heed it and shape their future course accordingly.	5.7572138103775785
1781. the editor of	the newport advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating	circumstances in the brown trial which would warrant making an exception	to the infliction of capital punishment.	5.424587757809686
1782. in direct contrast	to the other rhode island editors samuel s foss of the woonsocket	patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely	unfair.	7.494024241141003
1783. concerning the sentence foss wrote if it be possible	h that mercy shall override vengeance h and that john brown's	sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment it would be well- well	for the country h and for virginia.	4.693837359448853
1784. despite the excitement	being caused by the trial and sentence of john brown rhode islanders	turned their attention to the state elections.	9.831834914418453
1785. the state had	elected republican candidates in the past two years.	10.629471928084733
1786. there was no doubt	as to the control the republican party exercised throughout the	state.	15.019297435414208
1787. if it failed on occasion to elect its candidates for general state	offices by majorities the failure was due to a lingering remnant	of the know-nothing party which called itself the american republican	party.	5.813004471775559
1788. the american republicans and the republicans both nominated	lieutenant-governor turner for governor.	9.863462450239794
1789. elisha r potter	was the democratic candidate.	7.622507342753323
1790. the results of the election of 1859	found republican candidates not only winning the offices of governor	and lieutenant-governor but also obtaining the two congressional offices	from the eastern and western sections of the state.	7.486905181040149
1791. during	the month of november hardly a day passed when there was not some mention	of john brown in the rhode island newspapers.	5.6743711283467855
1792. on november	7 1859 the providence daily journal reprinted a letter sent	to john brown from e b a quaker lady in newport.	7.27979586597716
1793. in	reference to brown's raid she wrote though we are non-resistants	and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal	weapons h we know thee was anemated sic by the most generous	and philanthropic motives.	4.665147571492932
1794. e b compared john brown	to moses in that they were both acting to deliver millions from	oppression.	7.45847403908173
1795. in contrast to e b most rhode islanders	hardly thought of john brown as being another moses.	7.672765922445077
1796. most attempts	to develop any sympathy for brown and his actions found an unresponsive	audience in rhode island.	8.012492325072822
1797. on wednesday evening november	23 1859 in warren rev mark trafton of new bedford gave	a mission of sympathy lecture in which he favorably viewed the	harper's ferry insurrection.	5.83276718117318
1798. the warren telegraph stated	that many of rev trafton's remarks were inappropriate and savored	strongly of radicalism and fanaticism.	7.48837548295765
1799. in its account of the trafton	lecture the providence daily post said that the remarks	of	rev trafton made the people indignant.	7.143531346390224
1800. no sympathy or admiration	for brown could be found in the providence daily post	for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison	who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy.	9.470009324029682
1801. the providence	daily journal however stated that brown's courage bravery	and heroism in a good cause would make a man a martyr; it gives	something of dignity even to a bad one.	5.482722974299088
1802. the woonsocket patriot	admitted that john brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment	but he should no more be hung than henry a wise or james	buchanan.	6.759075170978014
1803. the newport mercury exhibited more concern over	the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of brown than it	did over the development of sympathy for him.	6.076611907364692
1804. in her letter	to john brown e b the quakeress from newport had	suggested that the american people owed more honor to john brown for	seeking to free the slaves than they did to george washington.	7.49089515317016
1805. during	the latter days of november to the day of brown's execution	it seems that most rhode islanders did not concur in e b's	suggestion.	5.493310502061078
1806. on november 22 1859 the providence daily journal	stated that although brown's pluck and honest fanaticism	must be admired any honor paid to brown would only induce other fanatics	to imitate his actions.	6.986245709640826
1807. a week later the daily journal	had	discovered the initial plans of some providence citizens to hold a	meeting honoring john brown on the day of his execution.	5.754655149236935
1808. the editor	of the daily journal warned h that if such a demonstration	be made it will not find support or countenance from any of the men	whose names are recognized as having a right to speak for providence.	7.437772766422768
1809. the providence daily post's editor wrote that he could	not	believe that a meeting honoring brown was to be held in providence.	7.5854605012165575
1810. he further called upon the people of providence to rebuke the meeting	and avoid disgrace.	10.1924612667147
1811. on december 2 1859 john brown was	hanged at charles town virginia.	8.165444542962874
1812. extraordinary precautions were	taken so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen within	the enclosure surrounding the scaffold.	8.265355556400815
1813. in many northern towns and	cities meetings were held and church bells were tolled.	7.819176677560846
1814. such was not	the case in rhode island.	11.127501089043744
1815. the only public demonstration in honor	of john brown was held at pratt's hall in providence on the	day of his execution.	6.301229890986515
1816. despite the opposition of the city newspapers	the pratt hall meeting brought together a very respectable	audience composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years	for their radical views upon the subject of slavery of many of our	colored citizens and of those who were attracted to the place by the	novelty of such a gathering.	7.737188194592903
1817. seated on the platform were amos c	barstow ex-mayor of providence and a wealthy republican stove	manufacturer; thomas davis an uncompromising garrisonian; the	reverend augustus woodbury a unitarian minister; the reverend	george t day a free-will baptist; daniel w vaughan	and william h h clements.	4.478998089126696
1818. the latter two were appointed secretaries.	15.015277771480363
1819. the first speaker was amos c barstow who had been unanimously	chosen president of the meeting.	8.387117123230578
1820. he spoke of his desire to promote	the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared john	brown of harper's ferry to the john brown of rhode island's	colonial period.	7.635116256816683
1821. barstow concluded that as rhode island's john	brown became a canonized hero if not a saint so would it be with	john brown of harper's ferry.	4.939408800593548
1822. the next speaker was george	t day.	14.768257079976625
1823. although admitting brown's guilt on legal grounds	day said that brown is no common criminal; his deed was not	below but above the law.	5.3605096340555365
1824. following day was woodbury who spoke of his	disapproval of brown's attempt at servile insurrection his admiration	of brown's character and his opposition to slavery.	6.903884072338288
1825. woodbury's	remarks were applauded by a portion of the audience several times	and once there was hissing.	7.649633957434579
1826. the fourth and last speaker was thomas	davis.	14.713057650315097
1827. by this time large numbers of the audience had left the	hall.	13.323422565952614
1828. davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling	of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the	citizens and all the newspapers of the city.	6.746800252800647
1829. he said that the propriety	or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled	by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments.	8.960813389182205
1830. in the remainder of his speech davis spoke of his admiration for	brown and warned those who took part in the meeting that they are	liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding	men whom the laws have condemned.	8.016356252822971
1831. he recalled that in rhode island	a party opposed to the state's condemnation of a man	proclaimed the state's action as a violation of the law	of the land and the principles of human liberty.	7.065964602967641
1832. at the close of davis'	speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president	and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously:	whereas john brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring	to deliver those who are denied all rights h and is this day doomed	to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper:	therefore   resolved that while we most decidedly disapprove	the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects yet h in his	willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom we still	recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit	which true men have always admired and which history never fails	to honor.	6.453207087225804
1833. resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in kansas	occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on	the propagation of slavery in that territory call for a charitable	judgment upon his recent efforts in virginia to undermine the despotism	from which he had suffered and commend his family to the special	sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice.	4.544304520807469
1834. resolved h that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for	resolute action.	8.090086871834746
1835. resolved that we find in this fearful tragedy	at harper's ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the	evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible h.	5.277318820493475
1836. on the morning following the pratt hall meeting the editor of the	providence daily journal wrote that although the meeting was	milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes	it could have been avoided completely.	8.36543660274874
1837. rather than being deceived the eye is puzzled; instead of seeing objects	in space it sees nothing more than- a picture.	6.445496664123035
1838. through	1911 and 1912 as the cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to	the literal surface became harder and harder to deny the task of keeping	the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving	contrivances.	6.183186985638247
1839. to reinforce and sometimes to replace the simulated	typography braque and picasso began to mix sand and other foreign	substances with their paint; the granular texture thus created likewise	called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective	over much larger areas.	5.764218648621162
1840. in certain other pictures however braque began	to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing.	8.392442651917648
1841. these areas by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern stated the	literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting	contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could	be rescued- and set to shuttling again- only by conventional perspective;	that is by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted	within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography	except near the surface.	4.4918623870537076
1842. the accumulation of such devices	however soon had the effect of telescoping even while separating	surface and depth.	9.329718690063466
1843. the process of flattening seemed inexorable and it	became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to	prevent it from fusing with the illusion.	6.293482407274422
1844. it was for this reason and	no other that i can see that in september 1912 braque took the radical	and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain	wallpaper to a drawing on paper instead of trying to simulate	its texture in paint.	8.40862933168598
1845. picasso says that he himself had already made	his first collage toward the end of 1911 when he glued a piece of	imitation-caning	oilcloth to a painting on canvas.	6.608654188169467
1846. it is true that his first	collage looks more analytical than braque's which would confirm	the date he assigns it.	11.95018499411066
1847. but it is also true that braque was the	consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography;	and moreover he had already begun to broaden and simplify the	facet-planes of analytical cubism as far back as the end of 1910.	7.798869797692726
1848. when we examine what each master says was his first collage we	see that much the same thing happens in each.	10.009650139710573
1849. that braque's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal	by its greater	corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness the affixed paper	or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more	vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures	had ever done.	4.575231936727398
1850. but here again the surface-declaring device both	overshoots and falls short of its aim.	9.063763358105355
1851. for the illusion of depth created	by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else	gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief which gives	way in turn and with equal immediacy to an illusion that seems	to contain both- or neither.	5.155399326705275
1852. because of the size of the areas	it covers the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily	as more than an indication or sign.	13.06503371473196
1853. literal flatness now tends to	assert itself as the main event of the picture and the device boomerangs:	the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before.	5.061022894047201
1854. instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing	it the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it and	the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with	which to finish as well as start his picture.	7.323443848917472
1855. the actual surface	becomes both ground and background and it turns out- suddenly and paradoxically-	that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion	is in front of upon the surface.	5.9103807356432965
1856. in their very first collages	braque and picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed	paper or cloth so that certain of the principal features of their	subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into real bas-relief space-	or to be about to do so- while the rest of the subject remains	imbedded in or flat upon the surface.	6.851875011958627
1857. and the surface is driven back	in its very surfaceness only by this contrast.	7.5619610009659075
1858. in the upper	center of braque's first collage fruit dish	a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally	vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture	plane.	7.284888431826524
1859. the trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no longer enclosed	between parallel flatnesses but seems to thrust through the surface	of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it.	5.934725622977054
1860. yet the	violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper and the	only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering	manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture	plane so that it does not jump.	7.816019890583046
1861. at the same time the wallpaper	strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and	patches of shading charcoaled upon them and by their placing in relation	to the block capitals; and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed	back by their placing and by contrast with the corporeality	of the woodgraining.	5.685060518747864
1862. thus every part and plane of the picture keeps	changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane; and	it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts	of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with	the surface.	6.614900744526586
1863. and the same thing more or less can be said of the contents	of picasso's first collage.	12.48426561568046
1864. in later collages of both	masters a variety of extraneous materials are used sometimes in the	same work and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving	and eye-undeceiving device they can think of.	7.17395119863937
1865. the area adjacent	to one edge of a piece of affixed material- or simply of a painted-in	form- will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface while	something will be drawn painted or even pasted over another part of	the same shape to drive it back into depth.	5.3741721271424
1866. planes defined as parallel	to the surface also cut through it into real space and a depth is	suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially.	6.046219493410928
1867. all this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to	encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it.	7.392144884266809
1868. flatness may now monopolize everything but it is a flatness become	so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself- at least	an optical if not properly speaking a pictorial illusion.	6.669091043463327
1869. depicted	cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal	undepicted kind but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms	the undepicted kind- and it does so moreover without depriving	the latter of its literalness; rather it underpins and reinforces	that literalness re-creates it.	5.227113559961203
1870. out of this re-created literalness	the cubist subject reemerged.	15.839022710561869
1871. for it had turned out by a	further paradox of cubism that the means to an illusion of depth and	plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation	or imaging.	5.924143006945969
1872. in the analytical phase of their cubism braque	and picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply	in order to preserve it; they had also had to generalize it-	to the point finally where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted	from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely	as the illusion of depth and relief as such: as a disembodied	attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself.	6.273115724412167
1873. in order to be saved plasticity had had to be isolated; and	as the aspect of the subject	was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable	and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity	was isolated under the cubist method the subject itself became largely	unrecognizable.	5.821668751334879
1874. cubism in its 1911-1912 phase	was on the verge of abstract art.	7.615092762846159
1875. it was then that picasso and braque were confronted with	a unique dilemma: they had to choose between illusion and representation.	7.940053434527958
1876. if they opted for illusion it could only be illusion per se-	an illusion of depth and of relief so general and abstracted as	to exclude the representation of individual objects.	7.544992431196737
1877. if on the other	hand they opted for representation it had to be representation per	se- representation as image pure and simple without connotations	of the three-dimensional space	in which the objects represented originally existed.	5.4381683460706505
1878. it was the	collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear: the representational	could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface	now that illusion and representation had become for the first time	mutually exclusive alternatives.	7.94894832720447
1879. in the end picasso and braque	plumped for the representational and it would seem they did so	deliberately.	10.530728638869983
1880. but the inner formal logic of cubism	as it worked itself out through the collage had just as much to do	with shaping their decision.	8.84590206424632
1881. when the smaller facet-planes of analytical	cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large dense shapes	formed by the affixed materials of the collage they had to coalesce-	become synthesized- into larger planar shapes themselves	simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane.	5.615217721960097
1882. left	in their previous atom-like smallness they would have cut away too abruptly	into depth; and the broad opaque shapes of pasted paper would	have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane.	7.22308603525201
1883. large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves	as independent shapes and to the extent that they are flat	they also assert themselves as silhouettes; and independent silhouettes	are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject	from which a picture starts.	5.089574935992049
1884. it was	because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason- that	is because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage	as a shape- that the identity of depicted objects or at least	parts of them re-emerged in braque's and picasso's papiers colles	and continued to remain more conspicuous there- but only as	flattened silhouettes- than in any of their paintings done wholly in	oil before the end of 1913.	6.781089267002746
1885. analytical cubism came to an end	in the collage but not conclusively; nor did synthetic cubism fully	begin there.	5.236383152695367
1886. only when the collage had been exhaustively translated	into oil and transformed by this translation did cubism become	an affair of positive color and flat interlocking silhouettes whose legibility	and placement created allusions to if not the illusion of	unmistakable three-dimensional identities.	6.200461707338752
1887. synthetic cubism began	with picasso alone late in 1913 or early in 1914; this was the	point at which he finally took the lead in cubist innovation away from	braque never again to relinquish it.	5.351618960068526
1888. but even before that picasso	had glimpsed and entered for a moment a certain revolutionary path	in which no one had preceded him.	9.323592251036969
1889. it was as though in that instant	he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly	tried to escape all the way back- or forward- to literal three-dimensionality.	6.425611220251034
1890. this he did by using utterly literal means to carry	the forward push of the collage literally	into the literal space in front of the picture plane.	8.890041861443022
1891. some	time in 1912 picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the	shape of a guitar; to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper	and four taut strings thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real	and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture	plane.	4.583650624155594
1892. the affixed elements of collage were extruded as it were	and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief.	7.7036145166949765
1893. and without	high density in the core rapid-transit systems cannot be maintained	economically let alone built from scratch at today's prices.	5.780015580284884
1894. however the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever.	11.045492157375909
1895. the new interchange among the four los angeles freeways including	the grade-constructed accesses occupies by itself no less than eighty	acres of downtown land one-eighth of a square mile an area	about the size of rockefeller center in new york.	5.592635127419237
1896. it is hard to believe	that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law	calls the highest and best use of centrally located urban land.	10.073806918041567
1897. as it affects the city's fiscal situation such an interchange is	ruinous; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should	be taxed to pay for the city services.	7.282524625225396
1898. subways improved land values	without taking away land; freeways boost valuation less	and reduce	the acreage that can be taxed.	7.238056180642532
1899. downtown los angeles is already	two-thirds freeway interchange street parking lot and garage- one	of those preposterous if statistics has already come to pass.	5.257307633900222
1900. the freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and	mitigates the access problem but it also acts inevitably as an artificial	isolating boundary.	7.4566280023606915
1901. city planners do not always use this boundary	as effectively as they might.	6.409536690321955
1902. less ambitious freeway plans may be	more successful- especially when the roadways and interchanges are	raised allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking	areas below the ramp.	6.204855426926829
1903. meanwhile the automobile and its friend	the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance.	5.8019468101117315
1904. in ever greater numbers factories are locating in the suburbs or	in industrial parks removed from the city's political jurisdiction.	8.255405050793478
1905. the appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry	which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants	enough land area to do the entire job on one floor.	5.71810131098908
1906. to light industry	the economies of being on one floor are much slighter but efficiency	engineers usually believe in them and manufacturers looking for	ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers.	6.300809634716768
1907. this movement of industry away from the central cities	is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe.	6.223081203743542
1908. it	is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern	of virtually all american cities.	7.95603204054056
1909. the big factories which are	relatively near the centers of our cities- the rubber factories in	akron chrysler's detroit plants ussteel's pittsburgh	works- often began on these sites at a time when that was the	edge of the city yet close to transport and	power.	5.788081919159148
1910. the leapfrog was a phenomenon of the railroad and	the steam turbine and the time when the belts of residence surrounding	the old factory area were not yet blighted.	7.497288527224647
1911. the truck and	the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his	plant site.	6.040227447879625
1912. until internal combustion became cheap he had to be near	a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community	of lower-class homes.	7.817525253817118
1913. the railroad siding is still important- it	is usually though not always true that long-haul shipment by rail is	cheaper than trucking.	5.782847598766815
1914. but anybody who promises a substantial volume	of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these	days and many businesses can live without the railroad.	6.763332865946206
1915. and there	are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking	lot which can be reached by driving across or against the usual	pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus lines is actually	more convenient than the walk-to factory.	5.155500035426077
1916. willow run general	electric's enormous installations at louisville and syracuse the	pentagon boeing in seattle douglas and lockheed in los angeles	the new automobile assembly plants everywhere- none of these is	substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit.	5.930123421182118
1917. they are all suburban plants relying on the roads to keep them supplied	with workers.	8.865091841116
1918. and wherever the new thruways go up their banks are	lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry.	7.199656001293057
1919. the	drive along massachusetts' route 128 the by-pass which makes an	arc about twenty miles from downtown boston may be a vision of the future.	5.3596486551143485
1920. the future could be worse.	13.848082117783294
1921. the plants along route 128	are mostly well designed and nicely set against the new england rocks	and trees.	6.727556652604531
1922. they can even be rather grand like edward land's monument	to the astonishing success of polaroid.	9.493647800865702
1923. but they deny the values	of the city- the crowded competitive tolerant city the melting	pot which gave off so many of the most admirable american qualities.	7.461231532667947
1924. they are segregated businesses combining again on one site	the factory and the office drawing their work force from segregated	communities.	7.955076995961806
1925. it is interesting to note how many of the plants on massachusetts'	route 128 draw most of their income either from the government	in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements or from the exploitation	of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly.	7.301972951377558
1926. while	the factories were always the center of the labor market they were	often on the city's periphery.	9.012698603219029
1927. in spreading the factories even farther	the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth	pattern of the cities.	6.564544075999645
1928. even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt's	motel has been relatively painless; the hotel-motel demarcation	is becoming harder to find every year.	8.023860528380537
1929. what hurts most is the damage	the automobile has done to central-city retailing especially in	those cities where public transit is feeble.	5.698896856754638
1930. some retailing	of course always spreads with the population- grocery stores drugstores	local haberdasheries and dress shops candy stores and the like.	6.928982445761588
1931. but whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago- a	new bedroom set or a winter coat an easter bonnet a bicycle for junior-	the family set off for the downtown department store where the	selection would be greatest.	4.991884827465006
1932. department stores congregated in the	one hundred per cent location where all the transit lines converged.	6.886249538313906
1933. these stores are still there but the volume of the downtown	store has been on a relative decline while in many cities the suburban	branch sells more and more dry goods.	6.171683885655582
1934. if the retailer and	hotelman's downtown unit sales have been decreasing however his dollar	volume continues to rise and it is dollars which you put in the	bank.	8.181246581774989
1935. in most discussions of this phenomenon the figures are	substantially inflated.	9.122329610706158
1936. no suburban shopping-center branch- not even	hudson's vast northland outside detroit- does anything like	the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise	to be found in the home store.	8.114174863986696
1937. telephone orders distort the	picture: the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than a central-city	number if both are listed in an advertisement especially if	the local call eliminates city sales tax.	4.8544455515306915
1938. the suburban branch is thereby	credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass	doors had never opened.	9.41309394558814
1939. accounting procedures which continue to charge	a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store	make the branches seem more profitable than they are.	4.881197498992359
1940. in many cases	that statement we break even on our downtown operation and make money	on our branches would be turned around if the cost analysis were	recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store.	6.895907892894721
1941. fear of the	competition- always a great motivating force in the american economy-	makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate	both the volume and the profitability of their rival's shiny new	branches.	6.035995758520743
1942. the fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are	uneconomical that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important	as it was downtown and that even highly suburbanized cities will	support only so many big branches.	7.960241431505064
1943. moreover the cost of operations	is always high in any new store as the conservative bankers who	act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover.	6.061537554093685
1944. when all has been said however the big branch store remains a major	break with history in the development of american retailing.	9.536753302738177
1945. just	as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant	to the worker with a car the trip to the shopping center may seem far	easier than to the downtown department store though both are the same	distance from home.	5.172178175753143
1946. indeed there are some cities where the suburban	shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown.	8.02998543183852
1947. raymond vernon reports that residents of east st louis	have been driving across the mississippi through the heart of downtown	st louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping simply	because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart	of town.	5.926729970273374
1948. to the extent that the problem is merely parking an aggressive	downtown management like that of lazarus brothers in columbus	ohio can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot	next door.	8.055514959195731
1949. if the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened	away from downtown by traffic problems however the city store	can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways	or await the completion of the federal highway program.	6.012365124161359
1950. and if the	affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with nice	people rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports	the downtown department store the central location may be in serious	trouble.	7.713098629745551
1951. today according to land economist homer hoyt shopping	centers and their associated parking lots cover some 46000 acres	of land which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's	central business districts put together.	5.097751349861165
1952. the downtown	store continues to offer the great inducement of variety both within	its gates and across the street where other department stores are immediately	convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available	before making up her mind.	7.280943023347293
1953. if anything may be predicted in the quicksilver	world of retailing it seems likely that the suburban branch will	come to dominate children's clothing	household gadgetry and the discount business	in big-ticket items.	5.234991302337023
1954. department stores were built on dry goods especially	ladies' fashions and in this area in the long run the suburban	branches will be hard put to compete against downtown.	8.73053719635555
1955. if this	analysis is correct the suburban branches will turn out to be what management's	cost accountants refuse to acknowledge marginal operations	rather than major factors.	6.965441976260615
1956. historically in america the appeal	of cities has been their color and life the variety of experience	they offered.	7.561275596970306
1957. how ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm?	9.223623211138529
1958.  was	a question that had to be asked long before they saw paree.	8.382891477782778
1959. though	americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious	belief they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality	of downtown.	5.0099227635573635
1960. only a radical change in the nature of the population in	the central city would be likely to destroy this preference- and we	must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change	gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians is actually upon us.	8.698759369225792
1961. in their book american skyline	christopher tunnard and henry hope reed argue that franklin roosevelt's	new deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility-	a fine ironical argument when you consider how suburbanites tend to	vote.	5.333529430372453
1962. the first superhighways- new york's henry hudson and chicago's	lake shore san francisco's bay bridge and its approaches	a good slice of the pennsylvania turnpike- were built as	part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression.	6.947300776652275
1963. at the same time roosevelt's federal housing administration	coupled with henry morgenthau's cheap-money policy permitted	ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes.	7.812264881662542
1964. bankers	who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house	itself got that security from the u s government; householders	who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term high-interest	mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per	cent under government aegis.	7.256996481802477
1965. before losing itself in the sands of the 19th century the grand stream	of italian renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance	in the brumidi frescos of the capitol rotunda in washington.	5.816322137650395
1966. the artistic generation after brumidi was trained in the paris	of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution and tended	to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were	easy to find.	6.573065341955498
1967. but it is a great conception.	31.023995328800048
1968. the open ceiling with	allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky:	the closed frieze formally divided into historical scenes and tightly	tied to the stone walls belong in their large ordering to the line	of correggio and his baroque followers.	5.914708560445037
1969. the descent may be remote	but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance	in the united states.	5.670580783382225
1970. constantino brumidi designed the	decorative scheme as a whole in collaboration with the architect charles	u walter at the time when plans were being made to replace	the wooden dome of bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure.	7.157946472103617
1971. after many years and many interruptions he was able to finish	the canopy fresco and slightly less than half the frieze beginning	with the liberty group opposite the east door and ending with william	penn all but one leg when a tragic accident ended his career.	5.138884160069826
1972. he left at his death sketches drawn to scale for the rest of the circle.	11.49359476990295
1973. these were carried out not too faithfully by filippo costaggini	who began by supplying the missing member to the founder of pennsylvania	and noting in pencil in italian that he began at this point.	4.975640010773229
1974. when costaggini had used up all the sketches thirty-six	feet of empty frieze were left over.	9.48316051799394
1975. a blank undecorated void plastered	in roughcast disfigured the wall of the rotunda until 1951.	6.567059171052165
1976. then	advised by the architect of the capitol the joint committee	for the library traditionally responsible for the works of art in the	building ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco to show	the peace after the civil war the spanish-american war	and the birth of aviation to match as nearly as feasible	brumidi's technique and composition.	6.722527492001212
1977. later the cleaning and restoration	were ordered first of the older part of the frieze finally of	the canopy.	8.461464506709005
1978. what follows is therefore a description of three separate	undertakings the new frescoing of the gap and the successive essays	in conservation with some discussion of problems that arose in connection	with each.	7.061981068229096
1979. for the use of students and future restorers	a full day-by-day record was kept of all three undertakings complete	technical reports on what we found and what we did.	6.966244983637631
1980. these may be consulted	in the office of the architect of the capitol or the library	of congress.	9.345417824482974
1981. the first preliminary was inspecting the unfinished	length of frieze a jumble of roughcast and finish coats all	in	bad condition.	6.340782016999416
1982. it was decided to strip the whole area down to the bricks	and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree	with the older artists' preparation with a mortar one part slaked	lime three parts sand to be put on in two layers.	7.6748607056434786
1983. cartoons were drawn	full size after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities.	6.514355485609624
1984. there was some difficulty here.	27.620949114990722
1985. one had to manage the given subjects	three diverse recent events so as to make them part of a classical	frieze- that is a pattern of large figures filling the space	with not much else against a blank background.	6.047404509479069
1986. moreover all three	representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the	length brumidi allowed for each one of his.	9.12662716328874
1987. when it was all	arranged to fit and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement	in the frieze the cartoons were tried in place.	7.3075110916581005
1988. the scaffolding a	confusion of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above was strong and	safe but obscured visibility.	7.48837548295765
1989. nothing could be seen from the floor	but by moving around the gallery one could get glimpses; and we were	able to decide on some amplification of scale.	5.777212207710725
1990. to be sure of matching	color as well as form pieces of cartoon were traced on the roughcast	and large samples painted in fresco then left two months to dry	out to their final key.	7.581833024065194
1991. later it was gratifying to note that they had	set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came.	7.163224651031167
1992. the	scaffold was the length of the space to be painted.	12.531617291991449
1993. what bits of brumidi	and costaggini could be reached at either end seemed in good	order though the roughish sandy surface was thick with dust.	5.555282555067309
1994. washed	they came out surprisingly clear and bright.	9.060328853487057
1995. it could be seen that	both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster one half inch	and that both followed the traditional italian fresco technique as described	by cennino cennini in the 14th century and current in italy	to this day.	5.829373477226255
1996. that is they used opaque color throughout getting solid	highlights with active lime white.	10.082331677013586
1997. painting a secco is much	in evidence.	7.622507342753323
1998. a brown hatching reinforces and broadens shadows and	much of the background is solidly covered with a dark coat.	7.452530369674391
1999. this brown	is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint.	7.256648703888728
2000. in our own practice to have the last intonaco plaster coat thick	enough to match and at the same time to avoid fine cracks in	drying	we found that it had to be put on in two layers letting the first	set awhile before applying the second.	8.50378255250806
2001. the mortar was three parts sand	to two of lime.	7.839212140222358
2002. some of the lime that is always on hand in the capitol	basement for plaster repairs was slaked several months for us;	but to make it stiffer of a really putty-like consistency to avoid cracking	we added a little hydrated lime- hard on the hands but we	could see no other disadvantage.	7.365761283383175
2003. i am told that a mortar longer slaked	might have remained longer in condition for painting.	8.46720532004783
2004. as it was it	took the pigment well for six hours enough for our purpose and held	it firmly in setting.	9.441349582537752
2005. it was obvious that to match brumidi white must	be mixed with all but the darkest tones.	9.668912062105015
2006. lime white hard and brilliant	has a tendency to jump away from the other colors in drying	and also by its capacity to set to preclude the use of ready-made	gradations so useful in decorative work.	7.069389621017823
2007. in older italian practice	lime dried and reground bianco sangiovanni entered into such	prepared shades.	7.121101195010236
2008. for convenience we chose a stronger pigment	unknown	to the early italians or to brumidi titanium oxide reserving the	active lime white for highest lights put on at the end of the day's	stint.	7.957295626019905
2009. other pigments were mostly raw umber some burnt umber and	a little yellow ochre.	6.097608955841794
2010. this last was probably not in brumidi's palette	but was needed to take the chill bluish look off the new work next	to the old where softening effects	of time were seen even after thorough	cleaning.	6.86260344642616
2011. the use of secco we tried to restrict to covering	joints.	10.071459845956968
2012. experience showed however that it is very difficult to	paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty	and uneven.	8.429131558951301
2013. later brumidi and costaggini will be seen coping with this	same problem.	7.369192064361683
2014. we were forced as they were to work a good deal of	tempera into background and dark areas.	12.067468125857795
2015. we made it by doerner's	recipe five parts thoroughly washed cheese curd to one of lime putty;	ground together they made a strong adhesive which became waterproof	in drying.	6.073431069407304
2016. figure 1 was taken in 1953.	9.670406878971576
2017. the new part is finished.	13.462269274192728
2018. on the right is the brumidi liberty group as it looked after	cleaning operations which had not yet come around to the other end;	where of costaggini only some foliage has been washed at the point	where his work stopped.	7.169834525572387
2019. one is led to speculate as to why the empty	space was there left for our century to finish.	7.457717264783016
2020. costaggini said it	was brumidi's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle.	7.7415947424293625
2021. brumidi's son later maintained that costaggini had compressed	and mutilated his father's designs ambitiously coveting a bit he	could claim for his very own.	4.903693293796623
2022. this question might be settled by comparing	the measurement of the actual circumference with the dimensions	noted presumably in brumidi's hand above the various sections of	his long preparatory drawing which has been kept.	6.709138172196773
2023. whose ever	fault	it is evident that brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with	his histories and come full circle with the scene of the discovery	of california gold.	5.155227809427053
2024. in painting a fresco the handling of wet mortar	compels one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right	not to spoil yesterday's work with today's plastering.	6.774772254408945
2025. at the	very first then brumidi was required by the classically pyramidal	shape of his central group to fill in the triangular space above the	seated girl on liberty's right before starting on the allegorical	figures themselves.	5.30005285639098
2026. here he put a small man whose missing hands	might have left his function doubtful until comparison with the first	sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning this	was to be the closing figure of the party of forty-niners and	was to hold a basket.	8.43118717204307
2027. one sees costaggini's rendering of the same	figure more than thirty feet away.	7.89407439859102
2028. the photograph figure 1 of the completed	frieze shows how having been separated from his fellows in	useless isolation for eighty years he has now been given a hand and	by juxtaposition given a new job	to represent the witnesses of the first flight at kitty hawk in	1903.	6.4885958392164405
2029. the startlingly bright effect of the first washings led	the committee to order the rest of the brumidi-costaggini cycle cleaned	and restored to go with them.	7.700710895162597
2030. the fixed wooden scaffold was removed	and so as to reach all the frieze one of pipe on wheels built	up from the floor.	7.562397901164827
2031. every few days in the early morning as the work	progressed twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the	plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the rotunda	pavement supported as it is by ancient brick vaulting.	5.714975107290679
2032. on this	giddy and oscillating platform over fifty feet from the floor after	a first dusting we began to wash.	9.117969531229706
2033. a most useful tool for wetting the	surface without running down was made from a greenhouse mist spray	nozzle welded to a hose connection to be used at low water pressure.	5.751463303409271
2034. a valve in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower.	8.40106343233402
2035. one	man sprayed with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting.	6.389442761368852
2036. a second	assistant mopped with two sponges.	11.87006678428286
2037. in parts a repeated sponging was	needed but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to restore	the original brightness.	6.664239250405618
2038. no soap or other cleaning agent was used that	might bring in unwanted chemical reactions.	7.979643700582811
2039. the painting a fresco	stood up superbly; a little of the secco came off.	6.578982329721101
2040. necessary	retouching was put on at once.	9.670406878971576
2041. altogether we found the craftsmanship	first rate especially brumidi's.	6.764147616291221
2042. we were greatly helped by	there being no traces of former restoring.	10.394674302063548
2043. apparently not more than	dusting had ever been done and not much of that.	6.732462722613262
2044. the plaster was sound	the intonaco firmly attached all over and the pigment solidly incorporated	with it in all but a few unimportant places.	7.0792145543296945
2045. the greatest	source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly flowed from openings	above soaking the surface and leaving streaks of dissolved lime	very conspicuous even after cleaning particularly in the landing	of columbus oglethorpe and the indians and yorktown.	4.842222929822367
2046. here the architect referring to the use of the capitol as a	public building not a museum requested some repainting to maintain decorative	effect rather than leaving blank unsightly patches.	8.834000485289488
2047. these frescos have had no care for eighty years.	8.190487125077498
2048. with naked gas jets	below and leaky windows above enough to ruin wall paintings in any	medium they have survived in a building long unheated in winter hot	and damp under the iron dome in summer.	6.369359450741108
2049. those whom i wish to address with this letter are for the most	part unknown to me.	6.560509073988371
2050. it may well be that when rudy pozzatti and i	visited your country last spring you were living and working close	to the places we saw and the streets we walked.	7.885204892251695
2051. as american artists	it was natural that we would want to meet as many soviet artists as	possible.	6.677305202961115
2052. this letter might not have been necessary had our efforts	to meet and talk with you been more successful.	8.804085024398725
2053. even though we did not	see many of your faces it appears now quite evident that a considerable	number of your profession heard from those whom we had the fortune	to encounter that we had been in your midst.	6.338055111999819
2054. i am very pleased that	quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to	hear of our reactions and experiences in the ussr.	7.963062676461319
2055. i	can well understand your curiosity.	8.254441635698543
2056. we ourselves are always eager	to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live.	11.282026938791386
2057. it is	my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the	good offices of the union of soviet artists.	8.046373385701944
2058. there should	be no reason to misinterpret or ignore the intent of this letter.	12.47660603413133
2059. pozzatti	and i endeavored earnestly to record our impressions without the	prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily provokes.	5.847855403616678
2060. the time-span	of little more than a month cannot entitle me to pose as an expert	on anything i saw.	9.321411505695309
2061. too much damage is done by experts who	have spent even less time if any at all in the ussr.	8.184987634943223
2062. nevertheless i consider it reasonable because of my commitment	as an artist to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative	individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific	geo-political interests.	7.930643190096074
2063. if this attitude is seriously questioned	in the soviet union it does not necessarily follow that the majority	of the society in which i live is too aware of the necessity for	clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view.	6.624200819171611
2064. it is	a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own countrymen	are too shortsighted to ascribe any symbolic significance to the	plight of a minority such as artists in any social order.	7.435083480990449
2065. i encountered	many questions and great interest upon my return from the soviet union	about my reactions to that experience.	6.321775434692772
2066. that which i found most	profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction.	8.53736587854009
2067. almost as if i were talking about something quite unreal.	7.76137333722516
2068. apparently	this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen	objectively or at least dispassionately to individual impressions	of a subject which preoccupies a good deal of their waking moments.	8.52163432832394
2069. personal	predispositions tend to blunt the ear and in turn the voice	as well.	6.805283987955822
2070. i cannot be content with the anecdotal small talk of a somewhat	unusual travelogue.	9.601741886163447
2071. i am equally impatient with the shrug of the	shoulder shake of the head of those who no longer care because they	have known it for so long; the aggressive disbelief of those who are	romantically lost in a semantic jungle of the word revolution;	the belligerent denunciations by the sick fanatics of ignorance who	try to build a papier-mache wall of pseudo-patriotism on our physical	horizons.	5.492892871268641
2072. difficult as it may have been at times pozzatti and i saw	enough talked to enough artists historians and others to realize	that the issue is quite clear.	6.795346328096994
2073. artists and poets are the raw nerve-ends	of humanity; they are small in number and their contribution is not	immediately decisive in everyday life.	5.006216128454496
2074. by themselves they may not	be able to save the life on this planet but without them there would	be very little left worth saving.	7.1905036505459305
2075. it cannot be said that our	very first day in the soviet union turned out to be an ordinary one.	11.648009580274373
2076. on that cold but bright april day we were guests of your government	in the reviewing stand of red square to witness the poeple's celebration	for yuri gagarin and later on that day we attended the somewhat	more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive palaces	of the kremlin.	6.93381805276375
2077. if we thus spent our very first day in the midst of	a large number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national	achievement our last day to us at least was equally impressive and	very moving even though the crowds were absent and there was almost	complete silence.	5.999097547888124
2078. we stood under a gigantic tree in the rolling country	just outside of moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of	a russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to	the point of foregoing the highest international honor.	6.317991228648421
2079. the grave about	half-way between his home and the blue turrets of a small church	rose above the forms and spaces of gently undisciplined pastures of green	the sounds of birds the silence of other graves and the casual	paths through small forests.	4.947134026516203
2080. just yesterday we had met and talked with	a living writer a contemporary of the dead poet who is known for his	ability of manipulating his ideas and his craft more advantageously.	6.297151095072911
2081. but today we were aware of only two men.	10.293179482668778
2082. one had taken a flight into	uncharted space in the service of science to return as a living hero.	9.238164636810307
2083. the other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted	space of the human spirit.	9.465283274094556
2084. the flowers on his grave attested to the	fact that he as well was somebody's hero.	8.841486798399378
2085. these two recollections	form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which	to me at least symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as ethical	conflict between materialism and humanism.	5.866465815174489
2086. a struggle that is	being waged all over the world in the half-light of disinterest.	11.857226038602619
2087. the	prevalent opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in	your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was	elaborated even further with an incredible semantic dexterity.	5.468901746529454
2088. the socialist	environment it was stated had cross-fertilized these two extreme	seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit.	8.749038374892583
2089. when i speculated	on one such occasion that the new growth like other mutations	might be unable to propagate i was immediately accused of preaching	racial prejudice.	6.245747459056707
2090. i could not bring myself to answer that some	of my best friends are non-propagating mules.	9.979213348330463
2091. this kind of	reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to.	9.321993967558964
2092. after a while	we were perhaps less surprised but still puzzled when a friendly	discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most irrelevant and	illogical comparisons.	7.378684693025713
2093. a chance remark about lenin's sealed train	brought the rejoinder that this was a myth akin to george washington's	cherry tree.	6.526487500617972
2094. theories of the behavior pattern of population masses	were compared to scientific discoveries concerning the motion-pattern	of gaseous masses.	7.604666493087551
2095. no wonder that pozzatti and i had at times difficulty	in remembering the real purpose of our presence namely cultural	exchange.	5.992799391385868
2096. typical of such an experience was the occasion	of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the union	of soviet artists.	7.264707011585602
2097. we had looked forward to what we hoped to be our	first informal meeting with a number of moscow's artists.	7.5594740825260685
2098. instead	we became involved in a series of friendly but overly formal welcoming	addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind.	9.101534102823583
2099. the terms	of friendship understanding cooperation etc tend to become	somewhat shopworn because of constant and indiscriminate use.	6.040227447879625
2100. i can only	hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between	our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion.	7.720236641145283
2101. the presiding female functionary of massive proportions and forbidding	appearance initially did not contribute to the expressions of	friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentlemen representing	the arts.	5.844130587240352
2102. it was only after we had responded with what i fear were	similar cliches that she went into action by questioning our desire	for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and	warlike actions by the us government in cuba and laos.	7.307493479774024
2103. she	retreated by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might	well terminate right then and there.	5.236383152695367
2104. unfortunately she returned later	just as i had taken advantage of the friendlier atmosphere in the	room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the cultural exchange	program would be the re-emergence of abstract art in russia	with social realism regaining dominance in the us.	6.675952771977414
2105. this	gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the petulant admonition	that we should not presume to lecture her on abstraction.	5.718993643496278
2106. she	did not go so far as to say as was done on other occasions that	abstraction as well as impressionism were a russian invention that	had been discarded as unwanted by the people of the ussr	pozatti and i could not know then that we would experience	this sort of treatment more often in moscow than elsewhere.	7.402022986230212
2107. we were	to discover in fact that quite a number of people share with us the	impression that in contrast to other soviet regions moscow's atmosphere	is depressingly subdued and official.	6.829022243131998
2108. to have one's intentions	deliberately or unintentionally misunderstood is always a waste	of time.	11.155037549088396
2109. until our moscow experience i had not considered it necessary	to prepare any argument formally or informally.	6.20902340932923
2110. artists simply do	not talk to each other in that fashion; and furthermore i could	not presume the implication that i spoke for american artists as a	group.	7.223711590516203
2111. to save time some clarification seemed necessary.	9.119587473979069
2112. the following	is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists	in leningrad:   we have come to your land with the	express intention of understanding and respecting your ideas and your	ways.	7.323197769752837
2113. our presence here should also be considered further sincere evidence	of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek	any and all possible ways to effect closer peaceful ties among all	people.	4.766150547538924
2114. we are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future	depends upon the informal contacts and exchanges of ideas between	individuals.	9.769675206434302
2115. in spite of the relatively short period of time that we	have experienced among you we have already seen many indications of	your character and spirit.	8.439928788414969
2116. we are acutely aware that yours is a society	which in spite of several wars and many privations has developed	itself into one of the foremost nations of the world.	8.99786200739055
2117. your past history	is resplendent with the fruits of the intellect.	7.655753926704058
2118. your present history	is equally admirable for its industrial and scientific achievements.	8.205142482231215
2119. we have come to you to experience something of your way of life	while	also attempting to acquaint you with that of ours.	8.536168516542052
2120. while we as american	artists	believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual	activity we would be less than honest with you or ourselves	if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as	well as the international community as a whole.	6.357969977264153
2121. in stating this position	we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists	and intellectuals in other lands to share our opinion in every respect.	6.23367665049665
2122. as a matter of fact we prize the diversity among our own people	so much that we will not presume to speak for all other american artists.	10.013009547019598
2123. but certainly all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge	and search for similarities between you and us but rather the thoughtful	exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead	us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of misunderstanding.	6.177959318434381
2124. like yourselves we have pride and love for our country.	9.115841268383512
2125. to many of us this is a land to which we or our parents fled from totalitarian	terror in order to live in dignified freedom.	8.953477993787729
2126. as artists we	feel the same obligation as do other individuals in considering ourselves	responsible citizens of a great nation.	8.525893046691978
2127. the sane society is an ambitious work.	8.976097203071156
2128. its scope is as	broad as the question: what does it mean to live in modern society?	9.35452167365515
2129. 	a work so broad even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed	by a moral vision must necessarily fail.	5.7841270288675535
2130. even a hasty reader	will easily find in it numerous blind spots errors of fact and	argument important exclusions areas of ignorance and prejudice undue	emphases on trivia examples of broad positions supported by flimsy	evidence and the like.	6.359052874429053
2131. such books are easy prey for critics.	8.771033092947984
2132. nor need	the critic be captious.	12.946764411202565
2133. a careful and orderly man who values precision	and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility might easily be	put off by such a book.	5.694134829135892
2134. it is a simple matter for one so disposed to	take a work like the sane society and shred it into odds and	ends.	9.516917760745065
2135. the thing can be made to look like the cluttered attic of a large	and vigorous family- a motley jumble of discarded objects some outworn	and some that were never useful some once whole and bright but	now chipped and tarnished some odd pieces whose history no one remembers	here and there a gem everything fascinating because it suggests	some part of the human condition- the whole adding up to nothing more	than a glimpse into the disorderly history of the makers and users.	5.203008301938112
2136. that could be easily done but there is little reason in it.	14.11974277275505
2137. it would come down to saying that fromm paints with a broad brush	and	that after all is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression	he has from the outset.	6.7176044642943795
2138. i mention these features of the book	because they are inherent in the book's character and therefore must	be mentioned.	8.913272091211942
2139. it would be superfluous to build a critique around them.	15.02125286435465
2140. there are more substantial criticisms to be made of fromm's account	of capitalist civilization.	15.516482489747535
2141. it is worthwhile to recall that	fromm's treatment has both descriptive and normative aspects.	9.47607946111833
2142. since	i have already discussed his moral position that discussion is	incorporated by reference into the following pages which will focus	on the empirical and analytic side of fromm's treatment.	5.950565555073685
2143. i shall	first indicate a couple of weaknesses in fromm's analysis then argue	that granted these weaknesses he still has much left that is valuable	and finally raise the general question of a philosophical versus	a sociological approach to the question of alienation.	5.770037733481585
2144. almost	no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation.	10.976418189748117
2145. despite	its rather long intellectual history alienation is still a promising	hypothesis and not a verified theory.	6.454874691434237
2146. the idea has received much	attention in philosophy in literature and in a few works of general	social criticism such as the sane society.	9.765991470953939
2147. what is missing is	work that would answer presumably by the use of survey methods and guttman-type	attitude scales such questions as these: what are the	components	of the feeling-state described as alienation?	6.06732482094703
2148.  how widespread	is alienation?	18.959357004774663
2149.  what is its incidence among the various classes	and subgroups of the population?	8.156826195943506
2150.  taking alienation as a dependent variable	with what socio-structural factors is it most highly associated?	7.682241427012676
2151. 	considered as an independent variable how does it affect behavior	in various sectors of life?	5.913639529546835
2152.  until such work is done there must	remain the nagging suspicion that alienation may be little more than	an expression of the malaise of the intellectual who rejected by and	in turn rejecting the larger society projects his own fear and despair	onto the broader social screen.	6.296145276200928
2153. i am not suggesting that	fromm ought to do this kind of work.	11.464257604420723
2154. nor do i think that alienation	is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual.	9.787607995285752
2155. i am saying only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence	comes in any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain	important limitations.	6.011835411903733
2156. until such evidence appears we must	make do with the evidence we have.	8.925582376413775
2157. here perhaps fromm is vulnerable	for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available	and he sometimes selects and interprets the evidence in rather	special ways.	5.640089242660943
2158. fromm's analysis of alienation	in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the	bureaucratization of the corporation the separation of ownership from	control and the broad	dispersion of stock ownership.	6.0728624714611374
2159. for all these	points he relies exclusively on berle and means's study of 1932 the	modern corporation and private property.	6.521296698411119
2160. the broad conclusions	of that pioneering work remain undisturbed but subsequent research	has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support has suggested	important revisions in the general analytic frame of reference and	has sharpened the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area.	6.57283498824015
2161. fromm seems unaware of these developments.	7.622507342753323
2162. another example	is his very infrequent use of the large amount of data from surveys	designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on	a broad	range of topics: he cites such survey-type findings just three	times.	6.815722888938181
2163. moreover the conclusions he draws from the findings are not	always the only ones possible.	6.98709399282772
2164. for example he cites the following	data from two studies on job satisfaction: in the first study 85 per	cent of professionals and executives 64 per cent of white collar people	and 41 per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with	their jobs; in the second study the percentages were 86 for professionals	74 for managerial persons 42 for commercial employees 56 for	skilled workers and 48 for semi-skilled workers.	6.922265917285735
2165. he concludes that	these	data show a remarkably high percentage of consciously dissatisfied	and unhappy persons among factory and clerical workers.	6.618347809508719
2166. starting	from other value premises than fromm's some analysts might conclude	that the percentages really tell us very little at all while others	might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low.	5.867756097854561
2167. eric hoffer	for example once said that america was a paradise- the only	one in the history of the world- for workingmen and small children.	5.9574180923949696
2168. what matters is that while fromm's reading of the data is not the	only one possible it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer	who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and	satisfied.	7.598404158947778
2169. fromm also cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction	conducted by the opinion research corporation in 1945 in which	49 per cent of manual workers said a man ought to turn out as much as	he could in a day's work while 41 per cent said he should not do	his best but should turn out only the average amount.	4.667035373045725
2170. fromm says these	data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are widespread.	7.615092762846159
2171. that	is one way to read the findings but again there are other ways.	7.820346456885255
2172. one	might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary	associations in the factory an interpretation which would run counter	to fromm's theory of alienation.	6.921633646929956
2173. or he might remind fromm that	the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly low: after all the	medieval guild system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per	cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount; and today's	trade unions announce pretty much the same view.	5.2512252661149335
2174. in view	of these shortcomings in both the amount and the interpretation of	survey-type findings on public opinion and considering the criticisms	which can be brought against fromm's philosophical anthropology	such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously.	6.765690349101724
2175. are people	happy are they as satisfied unconsciously as they believe themselves	to be?	7.162709377573845
2176.  considering the nature of man and the conditions for	happiness this can hardly be so.	10.667445180478408
2177. the ambiguities suggested	above stem from a more basic difficulty in fromm's style of thought.	6.637326681754935
2178. he seems to use the term alienation in two different ways.	13.131755713671161
2179. sometimes	he uses it as a subjective descriptive term and sometimes as an	objective diagnostic one.	6.112852567754032
2180. that is sometimes it is used to describe	felt human misery and other times it is postulated to explain unfelt	anxiety and discontent.	9.555542984138903
2181. the failure to keep these two usages	distinct presents hazards to the reader.	7.513801238435493
2182. it also permits fromm to do	some dubious things with empirical findings.	11.838738193581237
2183. when alienation is used	as an objective and diagnostic category for example it becomes clear	that fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far	toward conquering it.	6.38270889009178
2184. starting from this	and accepting his estimate of the iniquities of modern society it	would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would	be that of a work-satisfaction survey which reported widespread stated	worker satisfaction rather than widespread stated worker dissatisfaction.	6.032823168715323
2185. the point is that in a system such as fromm's which	recognizes unconscious motivations and which rests on certain ethical	absolutes empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition	the writer is urging at the moment.	7.275656140464657
2186. thus in the example cited above	fromm rests his whole case on the premise that the workers are being	deprived unconsciously unknowingly of fulfillment and then supports	this with survey data reporting conscious experienced frustrations.	6.7094122240182985
2187. he has his cake and eats it too: if the workers say they are dissatisfied	this shows conscious alienation; if they say they are satisfied	this shows unconscious alienation.	5.913908389731324
2188. this sort of manipulation is	especially troublesome in fromm's work because although his system	is derived largely from certain philosophic convictions he asserts	that it	is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and	from his own consulting room.	6.348513592991583
2189. while the empirical psychoanalytic	label which fromm claims sheds no light on the validity of his underlying	philosophy it does increase the marketability of his product.	5.995390196651971
2190. the final example of the failure to use available evidence	though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered	comes from fromm's treatment of some other writers who have	dealt with the same themes.	7.639212524229116
2191. in a brief chapter dealing with various	other diagnoses he quotes isolated passages from some writers	whose views seem to corroborate his own and finds it most remarkable	that a critical view of twentieth-century society was already held	by a number of thinkers living in the nineteenth h.	5.20871252147164
2192. he finds	it equally remarkable that their critical diagnosis and prognosis	should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of	the twentieth century.	7.618991898741296
2193. there is nothing remarkable about this at	all.	20.382054071433625
2194. it is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes.	16.635251464280763
2195. there is a difference between evidence and illustration and fromm's	citation of the other diagnosticians fits the latter category.	11.599737281606284
2196. glance at the list: burckhardt tolstoy proudhon thoreau	london marx tawney mayo durkheim tannenbaum mumford a	r heron huxley schweitzer and einstein.	6.632349365895319
2197. this is a delightfully	motley collection.	21.720414160094613
2198. one can make them say the same thing only by	not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants	to hear.	8.389328918947916
2199. the method of selection fromm uses achieves exactly that.	10.220672023418954
2200. furthermore	the list is interesting for its omissions.	9.060328853487057
2201. it omits for	example practically the whole line of great nineteenth century english	social critics nearly all the great writers whose basic position	is religious and all those who are with more or less accuracy called	existentialists.	6.320878626527629
2202. of course the list also excludes all writers who are	fairly optimistic about the modern situation; these almost	by definition are spokesmen for an alienated ideology.	7.986939146490382
2203. it is not hard	to find that concurrence of opinion which fromm finds so remarkable	when you ignore all who hold a different opinion.	7.47288586465558
2204. turning from	these problems of the use of evidence one meets another type of difficulty	in fromm's analysis which is his loose and ambiguous use	of certain important terms.	7.596583429467451
2205. one such instance has already been presented:	his use of alienation.	9.53533677413014
2206. the only other one i shall mention here	is his use of the term capitalism.	11.534500564906686
2207. for fromm capitalism is	the enemy the root of all evil.	7.737557619512619
2208. it is of course useful to have a sovereign	cause in one's social criticism for it makes diagnosis and	prescription much easier than they might otherwise be.	10.010636548054523
2209. if one characteristic distinguishes boris godunov it is	the consistency with which every person on the stage- including the	chorus- comes alive in the music.	6.523798856294125
2210. much of this lifelike quality results	from mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech	inflections.	9.739721297461733
2211. in this he followed a path that led back to the very	source of opera; such composers as monteverdi lully and purcell	with the same goal in mind had developed styles of recitative sensitively	attuned to their own languages.	5.815391374855542
2212. through long experimentation	in his songs mussorgsky developed a russian recitative as different	from others as the language itself.	7.3322587471022365
2213. giving most of his musical continuity	to the orchestra he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence	but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words.	4.9495055662483365
2214. the moments of sung melody in the usual sense come most often when	the character is actually supposed to be singing as in folk songs and	liturgical chants.	7.163114320776924
2215. otherwise mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies	for prolonged expressions of emotion- boris' first monologue for	example.	6.069352188143241
2216. even then the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that	the word comes first in importance.	9.394553212230063
2217. aside from boris himself	one need but examine the secondary roles to place mussorgsky among	the masters of musical portraiture.	6.044347723395408
2218. even those who appear in only one	or two scenes are full personalities defined with economical precision.	7.808265573550954
2219. consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action:	pimen varlaam missail and the jesuit rangoni.	6.644249059316758
2220. under no circumstances	could we mistake one for the other; each musical setting has	an individual touch.	8.40828673942554
2221. pimen is an old man weak in body- his	voice rarely rises to a full forte- but firm and clear of mind.	5.589010576882641
2222. his calmness offers contrast to grigori's youthful excitement.	9.631463447962453
2223. a	quiet but sturdy theme somewhat folklike in character appears whenever	the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past	life:    this theme comes to represent the outer world the	realm of battles and banquets- seen from a distance quite distinct	from the quieter spiritual life in the monastery.	4.789029027344989
2224. it changes and develops	according to the text; it introduces pimen when he comes before	boris in the last act.	10.85864069485859
2225. once he has been identified however a	new melody is used to accompany his narrative a bleak motif with barren	octaves creating a rather ancient effect:    an imaginative	storyteller pimen takes on the character he describes as if he	were experiencing the old shepherd's blindness and miraculous cure.	5.039456935538069
2226. here the composer uses a favorite device of his the intensification	of the mood through key relationships.	8.666035493847048
2227. the original d minor seems	to symbolize blindness inescapable in spite of all attempts to move	away from it.	7.309755854513507
2228. as the child addresses the shepherd in a dream light-	in the form of the major mode- begins to appear and at the moment	of the miracle we hear a clear and shining d major.	8.014277858073278
2229. varlaam	and missail always appear together and often sing together in a straightforward	rhythmically	vigorous idiom that distinguishes them from	the more subtle and well-educated pimen.	4.903693293796623
2230. their begging song might	easily be a folk melody:    the same could be said for the	song to which they make their entrance in the final scene.	7.689530745144533
2231. apparently	their origin is humble their approach to life direct and unsophisticated.	6.4837705874630664
2232. whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't disturb	them now.	9.205094467689216
2233. missail is the straight man not very talkative	mild-mannered when he does speak.	5.825820622377272
2234. varlaam is loud rowdy uninhibited	in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same.	8.244980822622942
2235. a	rough ostinato figure heard first in the introduction to the inn	scene characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into	the action:    the song of kazan in which this figure	becomes a wild-sounding accompaniment fills in the picture of undisciplined	high spirits.	5.190291898193216
2236. the phrasing is irregular and the abrupt key	changes have a primitive forcefulness.	8.649006242526841
2237. varlaam's music begins to ramble	as he feels the effects of the wine but he pulls himself together	when the need arises.	5.779136912329309
2238. both monks respond to the guard's challenge	with a few phrases of their begging song; a clever naturalistic touch	is varlaam's labored reading of the warrant.	7.13876213627646
2239. as the knack gradually	comes back to him his rhythm becomes steadier with the rigid monotony	of an unskilled reader.	6.635131223833771
2240. for the only time in the opera words	are not set according to their natural inflection; to do so would	have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene.	8.550165616409267
2241. musically and	dramatically rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as	varlaam.	7.214872179278036
2242. his music shows a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality	that suggest somehow a blood-kinship with dappertutto in offenbach's	hoffman.	6.966023347421749
2243. his speech shows none of the native accent of the	russian characters; in spite of the italian name he sounds french.	7.178160509753413
2244. his personality appears more striking by contrast with marina who	is- perhaps purposely- rather superficially characterized.	7.407049836017958
2245. rangoni's first entrance is a musical shock a sudden open fifth	in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it.	5.20949005976464
2246. the effect is as	if he had materialized out of nowhere.	11.261538969150815
2247. he speaks quietly concealing	his authority beneath a smooth humility just as the shifting harmonies	that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them.	5.722903588005325
2248. he addresses marina with great deference calling her princess	at first; it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme	that he uses her given name placing himself by implication in the	position of a solicitous father.	6.4019660578626105
2249. curiously this scene is a close	parallel to one that verdi was writing at the same time the scene	between amonasro and aida.	7.0219898319458975
2250. rangoni and amonasro have the same	purpose- forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her	country's cause- and their tactics are much the same.	6.083151600268427
2251. rangoni begins	by describing the sad state of the church; this brings a reaction	of distress from marina.	5.598483606048827
2252. the music becomes ethereal as he calls	up a vision of her own sainthood: it is she he tells her who can	bring the truth to russia and convert the heretics.	7.127864319617783
2253. as if in a trance	she repeats his words- then realizes with a shock her own audacity.	7.680163033479572
2254. this is no assignment for a frivolous girl she assures him.	13.44894830897719
2255. now rangoni comes to the point and we hear for the first time	a long downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic	motif of his sinister power.	6.477579054244203
2256. it is a phrase as arresting as a magician's	gesture with a piquant turn of harmony giving an effect of strangeness.	11.02243407942966
2257. another theme sinuously chromatic appears as he directs her	to gain power over grigori by any means even at the cost of her honor.	6.035141527309219
2258. coming from a priest the music sounds as odd as the advice:	marina rebels at this suggestion.	6.757567981697296
2259. her pride is as much at	stake as her virtue; she is the unattainable beauty the princess who	turns away suitors by the dozen.	5.813198545147495
2260. indignantly she denounces rangoni	for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her.	7.198778874655976
2261. at once the	jesuit pulls out all the stops.	12.778694209963412
2262. to music of a menacing darkness	he describes the powers of satan gaining control of the girl poisoning	her soul with pride and destroying her beauty.	7.470208738340757
2263. the combined threat	of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her and she falls terrified	at his feet.	6.422408906182968
2264. with another sudden change of mood he is again calm and	protective exhorting her to trust and obey him as god's spokesman-	and the chromatic scale descends in ominous contradiction.	6.505545451539822
2265. whatever	the source of rangoni's power marina is his captive now; we	are reminded of this at the end of the next scene when his theme cuts	through the warmth of the love duet again throwing a chill over the	atmosphere.	6.053142088582488
2266. the most unusual feature of boris however	is the use of the greatest character of all the chorus.	11.707622941470449
2267. this is the	real protagonist of the drama; the conflict is not boris versus grigori	or shuiski or even the ghost of the murdered child but boris	versus the russian people.	6.112768918127908
2268. mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the	extent to which choral scenes propel the action.	7.032105024464237
2269. boris' first entrance	seems almost a footnote to the splendor of the coronation scene	with its dazzling confusion of tonalities.	5.15576524365156
2270. we have a brief glimpse	of the tsar's public personality the official boris but our	real focus is on the excitement of the crowd- a signigicant contrast	with its halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene its bitter	resentment and fury in the final act.	7.718606425518384
2271. one reason for the unique	vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression.	7.440804311787194
2272. it rarely	speaks as a unit.	18.949080935241245
2273. even in its most conventional appearance the guests'	song of praise to marina there are a few female dissenters criticizing	the princess for her coldness.	7.125838474182799
2274. in many passages- for example	the council of boyars- each section of the chorus becomes a character	group with a particular opinion.	9.262177519826015
2275. hot arguments arise between	tenors and basses who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an	idea.	5.870785048786693
2276. the opening scene shows this method at its most individual.	10.215943051012516
2277. mussorgsky paints a telling picture of the common people those	who must suffer the effects of their rulers' struggle for power without	understanding the causes.	5.8621295887008245
2278. they are held in control by force but	barely.	13.920557496750066
2279. they will kneel and plead for boris' leadership in a strangely	intense song its phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for breath	but when the police with their cudgels move away they mock and	grumble and fight among themselves.	5.311005835378197
2280. there is a quick change from the	plaintive song to a conversational tone.	15.923983504229168
2281. hey mityukh asks one	group what are we shouting about?	6.930141700027754
2282.  and mityukh apparently	the intellectual leader of the crowd replies that he has no notion.	11.226761337922127
2283. the jokes and arguments grow louder until the police return; then	the people strike up their song with even more fervor than before ending	it with a wail of despair.	5.037374730288671
2284. mussorgsky frequently uses liturgical	music with considerable dramatic force.	8.581436094141479
2285. in pimen's cell the	soft prayers of the monks heard from offstage not only help to set	the scene but emphasize the contrast between young grigori's thoughts	and his situation.	5.312532867322121
2286. this is especially striking between pimen's	quiet exit and grigori's vehement outburst against boris.	11.670818393025478
2287. again as boris feels himself nearing death a procession files into	the hall singing a hymn its modal harmonies adding a churchly touch	to the grim atmosphere:  the words are hardly calculated	to put the tsar's mind at ease.	4.87298115481748
2288. they echo the words with which	he has described his own vision of the dying child who trembles and	begs for mercy- and there is no mercy.	8.366744007769604
2289. the living as well as	the dead now accuse him; this final reminder of his guilt is the fatal	one.	6.409396413845572
2290. one of the outstanding assets of the present production	is the restoration of the st basil's scene usually omitted	from performances and rarely included in a published score.	9.98639453439996
2291. though brief	it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy.	7.453151796471379
2292. in addition	it is an important link in the plot giving us a revealing glimpse of	the people's attitude toward boris and the false dimitri.	7.790727819047552
2293. the mayhem	in the forest of kromy is a natural sequel.	8.521295541842022
2294. the st basil's	scene opens with little groups of beggars milling around the	square the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny.	0.0
2295. in the	orchestra we hear first a hushed hesitant pizzicato figure then	the insistent police motif as it appeared in the opening scene.	6.698442508233473
2296. the service is over and a number of people come from the church	with their spokesman mityukh in the lead.	11.69045443331077
2297. they bring the news that	the pretender has been excommunicated; this is met with scorn by	the hearers who claim that mityukh is lying or drunk.	5.804269485817031
2298. contrasts the two groups by their orchestral accompaniment solemn	there is still more news mityukh	announces: they have prayed for the soul of the tsarevich.	6.361052125678128
2299. so far these remarks like most criticisms of hardy have tacitly	assumed that his poetry is all of a piece one solid mass of verse	expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development.	5.685722204246392
2300. for critics	hardy has had no poetic periods- one does not speak of early hardy	or late hardy or of the london or max gate period but simply	of hardy as of a poetic monolith.	7.571888905415643
2301. this seems odd when one recalls	that he wrote poetry longer than any other major english poet: domicilium	is dated between 1857 and 1860; seeing the	moon rise is dated august 1927.	5.6022079535623135
2302. one might expect that in a poetic	career of seventy-odd years some changes in style and method would	have occurred some development taken place.	8.436592717451486
2303. this is not however	the case and development is a term which we can apply to hardy	only in a very limited sense.	9.096890694722923
2304. in a time when poetic style and poetic	belief as well seem in a state of continual flux hardy stands out	as a poet of almost perverse consistency.	8.563285666197848
2305. though he struggled with	philosophy all his life he never got much beyond the pessimism of his	twenties; the sober opinion of his letter to noyes written	when hardy was eighty years old is essentially that of his first philosophical	notebook entry made when he was twenty-five:	the	world does not despise us: it only neglects us	.	4.8274065004272115
2306. and though in his later years he revised his poems many	times the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style	which he had established before he was thirty; so that while it usually	is easy to recognize a poem by hardy it is difficult to date one.	6.618169004842615
2307. there is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about	hardy's development: he did develop toward a more consistent and	more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his.	8.267871549888163
2308. there is only one hardy style but in the earlier poems that style	is only intermittently evident and when it is not the style is the	style of another poet or of the fashion of the time.	12.156028076306805
2309. in the later poems	however the personal tone predominates.	12.134450900135947
2310. the bad early poems are	bad shakespeare or bad swinburne; the bad late poems are bad	hardy.	8.09953302560164
2311. there are two ways of getting at a poet's development:	through his dated poems and through the revisions which he made in later	editions of his work.	7.736290719947678
2312. about a quarter of hardy's poems carry	an appended date line usually the year of completion but sometimes inclusive	years or two separate dates when hardy worked	on the poem or an approximate date	.	6.964837790668336
2313. these dates are virtually the only clues we have to	the chronology of the poems since the separate volumes are neither chronological	within themselves nor in relation to each other.	5.358627608314622
2314. with the	exception of satires of circumstance each volume contains dated	poems ranging over several decades	; the internal organization rarely has any chronological order	except in obvious groups like the poems of pilgrimage the	poems of 1912-13 and the war poems.	6.063719690941672
2315. from the dated poems	we can venture certain conclusions about hardy's career in poetry	always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole	must remain tentative.	6.2844189372966195
2316. the dated poems suggest that while hardy's	concern with poetry may have been constant his production was not.	8.112018110528632
2317. he had two productive periods one in the late 1860's the other	in the decade from 1910 to 1920	latter period and these alone total about one-tenth of all hardy's	.	6.231425616445089
2318. there was one sterile period: only one poem is dated between	1872 and 1882 and except for the poems written on the trip to italy	in 1887 very few from 1882 to 1890.	8.649579383475903
2319. the dated poems also	give us an idea of the degree to which hardy drew upon past productions	for his various volumes and therefore probably are an indication	of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time.	6.222596295354519
2320. poems of the past	and the present and time's laughingstocks both published	while hardy was at work on the dynasts draw heavily on poems	written before 1900.	6.567145176406102
2321. satires of circumstance and moments of	vision coming during his most productive decade are relatively self-contained;	the former contains no poem dated before 1909-10- that	is no poem from a period covered by a previous volume- and the	latter has only a few such.	4.660802049974593
2322. the last three volumes are again more dependent	on the past as hardy's creative powers declined in his old	age.	8.370426229102053
2323. these observations about hardy's productivity tally with	the details of his life as we know them.	7.947046214064194
2324. the first productive period	came when he was considering poetry as a vocation before he had decided	to write fiction for a living	he wrote that he wrote verses 1865-1868; gave up verse for prose	.	7.018059705840409
2325. during the poetically sterile	years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was	in addition burdened with bad health	.	7.6633775472892625
2326. two entries in the early life support the assumption that	during this period hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry.	7.874890637764374
2327. mrs hardy records that h at the end of november 1881	he makes a note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible	; and on christmas day 1890 hardy	wrote: while thinking of resuming 'the viewless wings of	poesy' before dawn this morning new horizons seemed to open and worrying	pettinesses to disappear.	5.083061685496505
2328. there	are more poems dated in the 1890's than in the '80's- hardy	had apparently resumed the viewless wings as he decreased the volume	of his fiction- but none in 1891 the year of tess and only one	in 1895 the year of jude.	6.137477936128797
2329. after 1895 the number increases and	in the next thirty years there is only one year for which there is no	dated poem- 1903 when hardy was at work on the dynasts.	6.653524911042454
2330. the second productive period the decade from 1910 to 1920 can	be related to three events: the completion of the dynasts in 1909	which left hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years;	the death of emma hardy in 1912 which had a profound emotional	effect on hardy for which he found release in poetry; and the first	world war.	7.068077781103549
2331. it may seem strange that a poet should come to full	fruition in his seventies but we have it on hardy's own authority	that h he was a child till he was sixteen a youth till he was	five-and-twenty	and a young man till he was nearly fifty	life	.	6.230814457743788
2332. we may carry this sequence one step further and say	that at seventy he was a poet at the height of his powers wanting only	the impetus of two tragedies one personal the other national to	loose those powers in poetry.	7.3913825035677805
2333. hardy's two productive decades	were separated by forty years yet between them he developed only in	that he became more steadily himself- it was a narrowing not an expanding	process.	5.074510734093508
2334. like a wise gardener hardy pruned away the shakespearian	sonnets and songs and the elements of meter and poetic diction	to which his personal style was not suited and let the main stock	of his talent flourish.	6.760583683442797
2335. the range of the later poetry is considerably	narrower but the number of successful poems is far greater.	7.518574669670681
2336. we	can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look	at two poems of very different qualities: revulsion	and neutral tones.	6.6100764004040125
2337. there is not much to be said for revulsion.	28.46342986330878
2338. like about half of the 1860-70 poems it is a sonnet	on a conventional theme- the unhappiness of love.	9.812490293835694
2339. almost anyone could	have written it; it is competent in the sense that it makes a coherent	statement without violating the rules of the sonnet form but it	is entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike hardy.	6.3518786607357
2340. the language	is the conventional language of the form; there is no phrase or image	that sounds like hardy or that is striking enough to give individuality	to the poem.	7.341668954455712
2341. it is smoother than hardy usually is but with the	smoothness of anonymity.	10.046011291162289
2342. it is obviously a young man's poem written	out of books and not out of experience; it asserts emotion	without evoking it- that is to say it is sentimental.	11.232402478716416
2343. there are many	such competently anonymous performances among the earlier poems.	11.130481812445225
2344. neutral tones we immediately recognize as a fine poem in	hardy's most characteristic style: the plain but not quite colloquial	language the hard particular colorless images the slightly odd	stanza-form the dramatic handling of the occasion the refusal to	resolve the issue- all these we have seen in hardy's best poems.	5.910250016824062
2345. the poem does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on exotic	sources of diction yet it is obviously not ordinary speech-	only hardy would say a grin of bitterness swept therebylike an	ominous bird a-wing or wrings with wrong or would describe	a winter sun as god-curst.	4.765491282338729
2346. the details of the setting	of neutral tones are not strictly speaking metaphorical but	they combine to create a mood which is appropriate both to a dismal	winter day and to the end of love and in this way love and weather the	emotions and the elements symbolize each other in a way that is common	to many of hardy's best poems	and to	some moving passages in the novels as well	.	8.75919743257224
2347. neutral	tones is an excellent example of hardy's mature style drawn	from his earliest productive period; i cite it as evidence that he	did not develop through new styles as he grew older	but that he simply learned to use better what he already had.	4.6476390623530195
2348. in the	poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's sense of the world; if	it is somber it is also precise and the precision lends authority to	the vision.	7.696337955461577
2349. in revulsion on the other hand the pessimism is	a case not proven; the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the speaker's	right to speak as he does.	6.875745358358814
2350. in the 1860-70 decade there are	many poems like revulsion but there is only one neutral tones.	13.696834210325305
2351. hardy was not hardy very often.	7.622507342753323
2352. the poems of 1912-13	offer a good example of hardy's style as it was manifested	in the later productive decade.	8.241635904246959
2353. these are the poems hardy wrote after	the death of his first wife; they compose a painful elegy to what	might have been to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness	and ended in long years of suffering and hatred.	5.578255752184274
2354. hardy obviously felt	that these poems were peculiarly personal and private; he sometimes	called them an expiation and he would not allow them to be published	in periodicals.	6.714116470895795
2355. they are the only poems that he rearranged as	a group between their first appearance	and the publication of the collected poems.	6.613280256005584
2356. the elegiac	tone is hardy's natural tone of voice and it is not surprising	that the 1912-13 poems are consistently and unmistakably his.	8.891370397772832
2357. the	view is always toward the past; but the mood is not quite nostalgic-	hardy would not allow sentiment to soften his sense of the irredeemable	pastness of the past and the eternal deadness of the dead.	5.587104705062957
2358. the	poems are the epigraph tells us the traces of an ancient flame;	the fire of love is dead and hardy stands as the speaker does	in the last poem of the sequence over the burnt circle of charred sticks	and thinks of past happiness and present grief honest and uncomforted.	5.873144082615351
2359. critically invisible modern revolt like x-rays and radioactivity	is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels	where	it is called delinquency.	4.958070100322966
2360. disaffiliation by the way	is the term used by the critic and poet lawrence lipton who has	written several articles on this subject the first of which in the	nation quoted as epigraph we disaffiliate h- john l	lewis.	7.085561371326057
2361. like the pillars of hercules like two ruined titans	guarding the entrance to one of dante's circles stand two	great dead juvenile delinquents- the heroes of the post-war generation:	the great saxophonist charlie parker and dylan thomas.	5.897208715495782
2362. if	the word deliberate means anything both of them certainly deliberately	destroyed themselves.	8.066087806204921
2363. both of them were overcome by the horror	of the world in which they found themselves because at last they	could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical	art.	6.584369483265651
2364. both of them were my friends.	15.370539491984484
2365. living in san francisco i saw	them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted	by exasperation or fatigue.	7.2909652413537875
2366. so as the years passed i saw them	each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration.	10.101773048705413
2367. the last time i saw bird at jimbo's bob city he was so	gone-	so blind to the world- that he literally sat down on me before he	realized i was there.	0.0
2368. what happened man?	23.610868104840403
2369.  i said referring	to the pretentious jazz concert.	9.95288923829895
2370. evil man evil he	said and that's all he said for the rest of the night.	10.19542491990246
2371. about dawn	he got up to blow.	9.264418504214198
2372. the rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent	melody spiraled through it.	8.649006242526841
2373. the last time i saw dylan	his self-destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality.	0.0
2374. it	had assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter.	8.581436094141479
2375. being with	him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling stones.	6.380731432796888
2376. now dylan thomas and charlie parker have a great deal more in common	than the same disastrous end.	8.702362714379504
2377. as artists they were very similar.	10.86495568007656
2378. they were both very fluent.	18.417974109049254
2379. but this fluent enchanting utterance had	compared with important artists of the past relatively little content.	8.232402233828171
2380. neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture	at his own creativity.	8.904469603528446
2381. the principal theme of thomas's poetry was	the ambivalence of birth and death- the pain of blood-stained creation.	6.602231030238404
2382. music of course is not so explicit an art but anybody who knew	charlie parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own	gift.	8.50701440888751
2383. both of them did communicate one central theme: against the	ruin of the world there is only one defense- the creative act.	9.4266575257164
2384. this	of course is the theme of much art- perhaps most poetry.	9.14660686660279
2385. it is	the theme of horace who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance	to parker or thomas.	7.456160179316808
2386. the difference is that horace accepted his theme	with a kind of silken assurance.	12.803716807082662
2387. to dylan and bird it was an agony	and terror.	8.786420140744127
2388. i do not believe that this is due to anything especially	frightful about their relationship to their own creativity.	16.127195476323095
2389. i believe	rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity	seemed to be the sole value.	9.658946899109276
2390. horace's column of imperishable	verse shines quietly enough in the lucid air of augustan rome.	7.032105024464237
2391. art	may have been for him the most enduring orderly and noble activity	of man.	6.578086170536535
2392. but the other activities of his life partook of these values.	13.821102766683222
2393. they did not actively negate them.	15.468949783101795
2394. dylan thomas's verse had to	find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning jews.	8.622295217086652
2395. he was	able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air	raids and gas ovens.	8.86346437560069
2396. as the world began to take on the guise of an immense	air raid or gas oven i believe his art became meaningless to him.	9.380083049246991
2397. i think all this could apply to parker just as well although because	of the nature of music it is not demonstrable- at least not	conclusively.	7.309552660892469
2398. thomas and parker have more in common than theme	attitude life pattern.	8.129673677907498
2399. in the practice of their art there is an	obvious technical resemblance.	10.973968230228177
2400. contrary to popular belief they were	not great technical innovators.	9.668999315049774
2401. their effects are only superficially	startling.	9.316814069021792
2402. thomas is a regression from the technical originality and	ingenuity of writers like pierre reverdy or apollinaire.	7.097229679741538
2403. similarly	the innovations of bop and of parker particularly have been vastly	overrated by people unfamiliar with music especially by that ignoramus	the intellectual jitterbug the jazz aficionado.	4.76581317220898
2404. the tonal novelties	consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music	for centuries.	9.420170092916738
2405. and there is less rhythmic difference between progressive	jazz no matter how progressive and dixieland than there is	between two movements of many conventional symphonies.	7.621336873942011
2406. what parker	and his contemporaries- gillespie davis monk roach	etc- did was to absorb the musical ornamentation	of the older jazz into the basic structure of which it then became	an integral part and with which it then developed.	6.825570308604376
2407. this is true	of the melodic line which could be put together from selected passages	of almost anybody- benny carter johnny hodges.	7.288790332174263
2408. it is true of	the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously or at least	is continuously sprung so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow	the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations of the phrase or	strophe.	8.846349138399919
2409. this is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque	to rococo music.	11.90733603805121
2410. it is the difference between bach and mozart.	25.030810209903233
2411. it is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what thomas	did to poetry.	16.857931246053788
2412. the special syntactical effects of a rimbaud or an edith	sitwell- actually ornaments- become the main concern.	7.663024046550707
2413. the metaphysical	conceits which fascinate the reactionary generation still	dominant in backwater american colleges were embroideries.	6.374057384651866
2414. thomas's	ellipses and ambiguities are ends in themselves.	9.060328853487057
2415. the immediate	theme if it exists is incidental and his main theme- the terror of	birth- is simply reiterated.	5.902564164932943
2416. this is one difference between	bird and dylan which should be pointed out.	17.43661410097315
2417. again contrary to popular	belief there is nothing crazy or frantic about parker either musically	or emotionally.	6.573304028508401
2418. his sinuous melody is a sort of nai^ve transcendence	of all experience.	9.954970500597222
2419. emotionally it does not resemble berlioz	or wagner; it resembles mozart.	7.111950423066715
2420. this is true also of a painter	like jackson pollock.	16.6443136855081
2421. he may have been eccentric in his behavior	but his paintings are as impassive as persian tiles.	8.45074812051215
2422. partly this difference	is due to the nature of verbal communication.	11.763412678947764
2423. the insistent talk-aboutiveness	of the general environment obtrudes into even the most	idyllic poetry.	6.817408452020724
2424. it is much more a personal difference.	25.534126320034105
2425. thomas certainly	wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world.	6.376389380082628
2426. parker and pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world.	8.979297569300416
2427. technique pure and simple rendition is not of major importance	but it is interesting that parker following lester young was	one of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution.	5.826846564016283
2428. in modern	jazz the saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played with conventional	embouchure.	9.034290540572359
2429. metrically thomas's verse was extremely conventional	as was incidentally the verse of that other tragic enrage hart	crane.	5.463700333582356
2430. i want to make clear what i consider the one technical	development in the first wave of significant post-war arts.	10.278985398086874
2431. ornament	is confabulation in the interstices of structure.	7.14162538120728
2432. a poem by dylan	thomas a saxophone solo by charles parker a painting by jackson	pollock- these are pure confabulations as ends in themselves.	6.731381435890986
2433. confabulation	has come to determine structure.	8.254441635698543
2434. uninhibited lyricism should	be distinguished from its exact opposite- the sterile extraneous	invention of the corn-belt metaphysicals or present blight of poetic	professors.	6.365727389270327
2435. just as hart crane had little influence on anyone	except very reactionary writers- like allen tate for instance	to whom valery was the last word in modern poetry and the felicities	of an apollinaire let alone a paul eluard were nonsense- so dylan	thomas's influence has been slight indeed.	4.843286672736022
2436. in fact his only	disciple- the only person to imitate his style- was w s graham	who seems to have imitated him without much understanding and	who has since moved on to other methods.	7.652274728384885
2437. thomas's principal influence	lay in the communication of an attitude- that of the now extinct	british romantic school of the new apocalypse- henry treece j	f hendry and others- all of whom were quite conventional	poets.	5.6427274801111595
2438. parker certainly had much more of an influence.	11.021613183094136
2439. at one	time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school	band in america to blow like bird.	6.370277482455107
2440. even before his death this influence	had begun to ebb.	14.764505849123005
2441. in fact the whole generation of the founding	fathers of bop- gillespie monk davis blakey and the	rest-	are just now at a considerable discount.	7.283710886717415
2442. the main line of development	today goes back to lester young and by-passes them.	10.24550072534126
2443. the point	is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays	are aberrant idiosyncratic.	10.257535314367495
2444. there is no longer any sense of continuing	development of the sort that can be traced from baudelaire to	eluard or for that matter from hawthorne through henry james to	gertrude stein.	12.048875494013984
2445. the cubist generation before world war 1 and	on a lower level the surrealists of the period between the wars both	assumed an accepted universe of discourse in which to quote andre	breton it was possible to make definite advances exactly as in the	sciences.	5.665444369780576
2446. i doubt if anyone holds such ideas today.	14.345191843103729
2447. continuity exits	but like the neo-swing music developed from lester young it is	a continuity sustained by popular demand.	5.236383152695367
2448. in the plastic arts	a very similar situation exists.	14.472504058424475
2449. surrealists like hans arp and max	ernst might talk of creation by hazard- of composing pictures by	walking on them with painted soles or by tossing bits of paper up in	the air.	4.595688357851942
2450. but it is obvious that they were self-deluded.	28.20498113366533
2451. nothing looks	anything like an ernst or an arp but another ernst or arp.	6.18936217805711
2452. nothing	looks less like their work than the happenings of random occasion.	7.615092762846159
2453. many of the post-world war 2 abstract expressionists apostles	of the discipline of spontaneity and hazard look alike and do look	like accidents.	7.170510863581735
2454. the aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random	may exist but it is a very impoverished appeal.	9.605882008963722
2455. once again what has	happened is an all-consuming confabulation of the incidentals the accidents	of painting.	7.047649767324945
2456. it is curious that at its best the work of this	school of painting- mark rothko jackson pollock clyfford still	robert motherwell willem de-kooning and the rest- resembles	nothing so much as the passage painting of quite unimpressive painters:	the mother-of-pearl shimmer in the background of a henry mcfee	itself a formula derived from renoir; the splashes of light and	black which fake drapery in the fashionable imitators of hals and sargent.	6.864033054103141
2457. often work of this sort is presented as calligraphy- the pure	utterance of the brush stroke seeking only absolute painteresque values.	6.48518912235855
2458. you have only to compare such painting with the work of say	sesshu to realize that someone is using words and brushes carelessly.	9.979619857777196
2459. at its best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo	decorative surface.	8.444373836556068
2460. its poverty shows up immediately when compared	with tiepolo where the rococo rises to painting of extraordinary profundity	and power.	6.885845530166437
2461. a tiepolo painting however confabulated is a	universe of tensions in vast depths.	6.62197242591231
2462. a pollock is an object of art-	bijouterie- disguised only by its great size.	8.121134903484508
2463. in fact once the size	is big enough to cover a whole wall it turns into nothing more than	extremely expensive wallpaper.	6.779142684935131
2464. now there is nothing wrong with complicated	wallpaper.	19.861570628781667
2465. there is just more to tiepolo.	20.465764338977046
2466. the great ashikaga	brush painters painted wallpapers too- at least portable ones	screens.	9.69584296187422
2467. a process of elimination which leaves the artist with	nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest	in either artist or public for very long.	5.3830541283342495
2468. so in the last couple	of years abstract expressionism has tended toward romantic suggestion-	indications of landscape or living figures.	10.011989724463431
2469. anglo-saxon and greek epic each provide on two occasions	a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic	age.	5.2316497178608055
2470. hrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at finnsburg	and improvises the tale of beowulf's exploits in	a complimentary comparison of the geatish visitor with sigemund	; alcinou^s' court bard sings of the discovered adultery	of ares and aphrodite and takes up	a tale of odysseus while the ithacan wanderer listens on	.	5.489183308742081
2471. nothing in all this is autobiographical: unlike	the poets of deor and widsith the poet of beowulf is	not concerned with his own identity; the poet of the odyssey	reputed blind reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel	demodocus.	6.107347697335239
2472. since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing	is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter there	is prima-facie evidence that beowulf and the homeric poems each	derive from an oral tradition.	6.376972665209586
2473. that such a tradition lies behind	the iliad and the odyssey at least is hard to deny.	7.496353765918881
2474. milman	parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant homeric	poems are largely formulaic and was led to postulate that they could	be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of greek epic survived;	he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate	oral composition and assumed the slightly less likely corollary	that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas.	5.525658946227611
2475. proceeding from	parry's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata francis p	magoun jr argues that beowulf likewise was created from	a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive	generations and the thesis is striking and compelling.	4.5840097891606915
2476. yet a fresh	inspection will indicate one crucial amendment: beowulf and	the homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent.	9.512129793534319
2477. the bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a	very skilful oral poet but it appears safe to assume that no sustained	narrative in rhyme could be composed without extreme difficulty even	in a language of many terminal inflections.	5.126978866115259
2478. assonance seems nearly	as severe a curb although in a celebrated passage william of malmesbury	declares that a song of roland was intoned before the battle	commenced at hastings.	6.064510266373365
2479. the anglo-saxon alliterative line and the	homeric hexameter probably imposed less of a restraint; the verse	of beowulf or of the iliad and the odyssey was not easy	to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents	perforce in earning a livelihood.	4.995286883288707
2480. yet certain aids were valuable	and quite credibly necessary for reciting long stretches of verse without	a pause.	7.860440992708896
2481. the poet in a written tradition who generally never blots	a line may once in a while pause and polish without incurring blame.	5.401704351336071
2482. but the oral poet cannot pause; he must improvise continuously	with no apparent effort.	10.07298030171053
2483. even though the bondage of his verse is not	so great as the writing poet can manage it is still great enough for	him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid	composition.	5.631693305072454
2484. the germanic poet had such aids in the kennings which	provided for the difficulties of alliteration; the homeric poet	had epithets which provided for recurring needs in the hexameter.	6.92244967757774
2485. either	poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply	his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines because the kennings	and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous	synonyms for the chief common and proper nouns.	4.7586405289825215
2486. other synonyms	could of course serve the same function and for the sake of ease i	shall speak of kennings and epithets in the widest and loosest poss1ble	sense and name for example gar-dene a kenning for the danes.	6.612118413818551
2487. verbal and adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction	but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and	adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents and to designate the	members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the poetic	language.	4.995698215649711
2488. limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in anglo-saxon	as in the other germanic dialects we cannot say how frequently	the kennings in beowulf recurred in contemporary epic on the same	soil.	6.587538010456491
2489. but we can say that since a writing poet with leisure before	him would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and	substantial circumlocution the kennings like the epithets must reasonably	be ascribed to an oral tradition.	5.683519988500159
2490. one of the greatest	homerists of our time frederick m combellack argues that when	it is assumed the iliad and the odyssey are oral poems the	postulated single redactor called homer cannot be either credited with	or denied originality in choice of phrasing.	7.654115508483899
2491. any example of grand	or exquisite diction may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous	lays into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his	completely	unknown fellow-craftsmen.	6.0576201673376495
2492. the quest of the historical homer	is likely never to have further success; no individual word in the	iliad or the odyssey can be credited to any one man; no strikingly	effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance	be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus	that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before	christ.	6.56751093092572
2493. this observation is of interest not only to students of homeric	poetry but to students of anglo-saxon poetry as well.	6.278496010275255
2494. to the	extent that a tale is twice told its final author must be suspect although	plagiarism in an oral tradition is less a misdemeanor than the	standard modus dicendi.	6.489845441307498
2495. combellack argues further and here	he makes his main point that once the iliad and the odyssey	are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to	formulaic poetry homeric critics are deprived of an entire domain they	previously found arable.	4.528081680082931
2496. with a few important and a few more unimportant	exceptions no expression can be deemed le mot juste for its	context because each was very probably the only expression that long-established	practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow.	6.930284920411557
2497. words	or phrases that connoisseurs have admired as handsome or ironic or	humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable	time-servers sometimes accurate and sometimes not.	4.726707772215755
2498. this observation	too may have reference to anglo-saxon poetry.	10.867675364171879
2499. to the extent that	a language is formulaic its individual components must be regarded	as no more distinguished than other cliches.	6.800485980416366
2500. w f bryan	suggests that certain kennings in beowulf were selected sometimes	for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness but	such a view would appear untenable unless it is denied that the language	of beowulf is formulaic.	5.770010445349895
2501. if the master of scops who was most	responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional he	was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd	and sophisticated misuse of speech elements.	5.459820631062979
2502. once many significant	phrases are found in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for	prosodic necessity they are not to be defended for their semantic properties	in isolated contexts.	8.225325923752079
2503. it is false to be certain of having discovered	in the language of beowulf such effects as intentional irony.	8.826774142520293
2504. yet if the argument is turned awry there may be found a	great deal in bryan's view after all.	8.150375262010103
2505. a formulaic element need not	be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious	reflection.	6.753689599301928
2506. time-servers though the periphrastic expressions are	they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous.	7.032105024464237
2507. a long evolution	in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic	age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things	and these formulas are therefore potentially rather than always actually	accurate.	5.28418895858997
2508. true we do not know how they were regarded in their	day but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive	to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who	have read germanic or homeric poetry all their lives and still found	much to admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases.	7.244939295888758
2509. nouns and adjectives in a written tradition are chosen for the nonce;	in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus	and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation.	4.8778618439062065
2510. reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars	in an oral poem; no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable	ruins of heorot or the palace of priam.	6.435369987839622
2511. a ship at dry-dock	could be called a foamy-necked floater in anglo-saxon or a swift	ship in greek.	6.133266541338854
2512. even when defenseless of weapons the danes would be	gar-dene and priam would be |e|u|m|m|e|l|i|h|s.	9.251300480935768
2513. achilles like siegfried in the nibelungenlied	is potentially the swiftest of men and may accordingly	be called swift-footed even when he stands idle.	5.176194017828768
2514. in coriolanus	the agnomen of marcius is used deliberately and pointedly but the	homeric epithets and the anglo-saxon kennings are used casually and	recall to the hearer a familiar story or situation or a useful or	pleasant quality of the referent.	6.511591977304625
2515. the epic language was not entirely	the servant of the poet; it was partly his master.	6.196120048044738
2516. the poet's	intentions are difficult to discern and except to biographers unimportant;	the language however is a proper object of scrutiny and the	effects of the language are palpable even if sometimes inevitable.	6.806519214711211
2517. beowulf and the homeric poems appear oral compositions.	6.764147616291221
2518. yet	they are written; at some stage in their evolution they were transcribed.	7.551142963309131
2519. albert b lord suggests that the homeric poems were dictated	to a scribe by a minstrel who held in his mind the poems fully matured	but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it	would	be useless to his guild and magoun argues that the beowulf	poet and cynewulf may have dictated their verse in the same fashion.	4.764968979983582
2520. this explanation is attractive but is vitiated at least in part by	the observation that cynewulf though he used kennings in the traditional	manner was a literate man who four times inscribed his name by runes	into his works.	6.961063126158051
2521. if cynewulf was literate the beowulf poet	may have been also and so may the final redactor of the iliad and	the odyssey.	5.83870492964239
2522. in lieu of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate	bard one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry	recited and became intimately familiar with the established aids	to poetizing and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of	the compositions of the past.	6.785017561187208
2523. other theories of origin are compatible	with the formulaic theory: beowulf may contain a design for	terror and the iliad may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering	to a ceramic pattern produced during the geometric period in	pottery.	4.850102344993435
2524. the account of the growth and final transcription of these	epics rests partly however upon the degree to which they were formulaic.	9.509584365532179
2525. carl eduard schmidt counted 1804 different lines repeated	exactly in the two homeric poems and by increasing this figure so	as to include lines repeated with very slight modifications he counted	2118 different lines used a total of 5612 times.	4.79231489244203
2526. thus one line in	five from the iliad and the odyssey is to be found somewhere	else in the two poems.	9.78255484886359
2527. the ratio is thoroughly remarkable because the	lines are so long- half again as long as those of beowulf.	6.78142434277876
2528. anglo-saxon	poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition;	there is no reason to think that the scop used and re-used whole lines	and even lengthy passages after the manner of his homeric colleague.	7.950849111100524
2529. in determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle	however to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their entirety	for a stock of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the poet	to extemporize with deftness if they provided for prosodic needs.	5.435650160094619
2530. the closest scrutiny is owed to the anglo-saxon kennings and the homeric	epithets; if any words or phrases are formulaic they will be.	6.852952259467768
2531. the iliad has two words for the shield |a|s|p|i|s	and |s|a|k|o|s.	7.43304005989246
2532. recent criticism of great expectations has tended to emphasize	its symbolic and mythic content to show as m d zabel has	said of dickens generally that much of the novel's impact resides	in its allegoric insight and moral metaphor.	6.629735056239761
2533. j h miller's	excellent chapter on great expectations has lately illustrated	how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective.	5.24335413163277
2534. in his analysis however he touches upon but fails to explore an idea	generally neglected in discussions of the book which i believe is	central to its art- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature	of the narrative.	6.990891126165973
2535. this essay seeks to make that exploration.	11.111637260897332
2536. dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great victorian	writers.	7.9212783525028
2537. he knew instinctively that next to voice and face an	actor's hands are his most useful possession- that in fiction as	in the theatre gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing	character and dramatizing action and response.	5.25066009146314
2538. it is hardly accidental	therefore that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or	eccentric things with their hands.	12.133349405580867
2539. in great expectations the hands	become almost an obsession.	9.331389223331769
2540. mr jaggers habitually bites his	forefinger	a gesture which conveys both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness	that half fascinates half terrifies all who have dealings with him.	6.574231878500228
2541. miss havisham's withered hands heavy as if her unhappiness were	somehow concentrated in them move in restless self-pity between her	broken heart and her walking stick.	5.0773330825786385
2542. pumblechook's signature	is the perpetually extended glad hand.	9.060328853487057
2543. wemmick reveals his self-satisfaction	by regularly rubbing his hands together.	6.460370037324521
2544. old mr pocket's	frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless social-climbing	wife is to put his two hands into his disturbed hair and make	an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it whereas	joe gargery endures the shrewish onslaughts of mrs joe by apologetically	drawing the back of his hand across and across his nose.	5.94763554170693
2545. such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark were it	not that in great expectations as in no other of dickens' novels	hands serve as a leitmotif of plot and theme- a kind of unifying	symbol or natural metaphor for the book's complex of human interrelationships	and the values and attitudes that motivate them.	4.852760853751759
2546. dickens	not only reveals character through gesture he makes hands a crucial	element of the plot a means of clarifying the structure of the novel	by helping to define the hero's relations with all the major characters	and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt pursuit	crime greed education materialism enslavement	friendship romantic love forgiveness and redemption.	6.165388617048782
2547. we have only to think of lady macbeth or the policeman-murderer	in thomas burke's famous story the hands of mr ottermole	to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment.	6.34576232335543
2548. so it is with great expectations whether the hands be	orlick's	as he strikes down mrs gargery or pip's as he steals a	pie from her pantry.	7.823881790210865
2549. such associations suit well with the gothic or	mystery-story aspects of dickens' novel but on a deeper plane they	relate to the themes of sin guilt and pursuit that have recently	been analyzed by other critics.	4.921988208937112
2550. the novel opens with a fugitive	convict frantically trying to avoid the nemesis of being laid hands	on- a mysterious figure who looks into pip's frightened	eyes in the churchyard as if he were eluding the hands of the dead	people stretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist	upon his ankle and pull him in.	7.0665601113159004
2551. magwitch terrifies pip into	stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination	of a bogy man who may softly creep h his way to him and tear	him open in him.	5.190153937133001
2552. as pip agonizes	over the theft that his own hands have committed his guilty conscience	projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local signpost transforming	it into a phantom devoting me to the hulks.	6.9652890256336715
2553. held	upside down in the graveyard pip clings in terror with both hands	to his convict; later he flees in panic from the family table	just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the	front door by a soldier who accusingly holds out a pair of handcuffs which	he has brought to gargery's forge for mending.	4.785847838346531
2554. through such details	dickens indicates at the outset that guilt is a part of the ironic	bond between pip and magwitch which is so unpredictably to alter	both their lives.	8.868133355665853
2555. since they commonly translate thoughts and	feelings into deeds hands naturally represent action and since nearly	half the characters in great expectations are of the underworld	or closely allied to it the linking of hands with crime or violence	is not to be wondered at.	5.169149522281497
2556. dickens for excellent psychological reasons	never fully reveals magwitch's felonious past but pip at the	convict's climactic reappearance in london shrinks from clasping	a hand which he fears might be stained with blood.	5.830388127029086
2557. orlick	slouches about the forge like cain with his hands in his pockets	and when he shouts abuse at mrs joe for objecting	to his holiday she claps her hands in a tantrum beats them upon her	bosom and upon her knees and clenches them in her husband's	hair.	4.553092154645561
2558. this last rampage is only the prelude to the vicious	blow upon her head dealt by some unknown hand whose identity	is later revealed not verbally but through a manual action- the tracing	of orlick's hammer upon a slate.	6.454169805465994
2559. pip himself is to feel the	terror of orlick's murderous hand in his secret rendezvous	at the sluicehouse on the marshes.	5.083242045036259
2560. dickens lays great emphasis on	the hands in this scene.	8.196044167676531
2561. orlick shakes his hand at pip bangs the table	with his fist draws his unclenched hand across his mouth as if	his mouth watered for his victim lets his hands hang loose and	heavy at his sides and pip observes him so intensely that he knows	of the slightest action of his fingers.	4.2611486463056485
2562. orlick might almost	be magwitch's bogy man come alive a figure of nemesis from pip's	phantasy of guilt.	7.086474546528567
2563. the scarred disfigured wrists of mr	jaggers' housekeeper are the tell-tale marks of her sinister	past for her master coolly exhibiting them to his dinner guests makes	a point of the force of grip there is in these hands.	5.400391395101165
2564. jaggers'	iron control over her	any dish she put before him hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling	rests on his having once got her acquitted	of a murder charge by cleverly contriving her sleeves at the trial to	conceal her strength and by passing off the lacerations on the backs	of her hands as the scratches of brambles rather than of human fingernails.	5.440067206524194
2565. it is the similarity between estella's hands and molly's	that provides pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and	establishes a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and	the genteel cruelty of satis house.	6.313363151106085
2566. finally magwitch's pursuit	of compeyson his archenemy and betrayer begins by his holding him	in a vicelike grip on the river flats to frustrate his escape and culminates	in his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him	thus precipitating the death-locked struggle in the water during which	compeyson drowns.	0.0
2567. magwitch's hand here ironically becomes the agent	of justice.	6.764147616291221
2568. but only in one of its aspects is great expectations	a tale of violence revenge and retribution.	11.433813223815921
2569. money so	important a theme elsewhere in dickens is here central and hands are	often associated in some way with the false values- acquisitiveness	snobbery self-interest hypocrisy toadyism irresponsibility injustice-	that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of wealth.	4.996985353265486
2570. dickens suggests	the economic evils of such a society on the first page	of his novel in the description of pip's five little dead brothers	who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal	struggle who seemed to have all been born on their backs	with their hands in their trousers-pockets and had never taken them	out	in this state of existence.	6.480494847199475
2571. pip's great expectations his	progress through illusion and disillusionment turn somewhat as they	do for the naive hero of dreiser's american tragedy upon	the	lure of genteel prosperity through unearned income- what wemmick calls	portable property and what jaggers reproaches pip for letting	slip through his fingers.	4.364845775266633
2572. since a gentleman	must if possible avoid sullying them by work his hands as importantly	as his accent become the index of social status.	7.065419389046016
2573. almost the first	step in the corruption of pip's values is the unworthy shame he	feels when estella cruelly remarks the coarseness of his hands: they	had never troubled me before but they troubled me now as vulgar	appendages.	4.700315105321459
2574. pip imagines how estella would look down upon	joe's hands roughened by work in the smithy and the deliberate contrast	between her white hands and his blackened ones is made to symbolize	the opposition of values between which pip struggles- idleness	and work artificiality and naturalness gentility and commonness coldness	and affection- in fact between satis house and the forge.	5.799201731991027
2575. when the snobbery that alienates pip from joe finally gives way before	the deeper and stronger force of love the reunion is marked by an	embarrassed handshake at which pip exclaims no don't wipe it	off- for god's sake give me your blackened hand!	pip's abject leave-taking of miss havisham during which he kneels	to kiss her hand signalizes his homage to a supposed patroness who	seems to be opening up for him a new world of glamour; when on the	journey to london that immediately follows he pauses nostalgically	to lay his hand upon the finger-post at the end of the village the wooden	pointer symbolically designates a spiritual frontier between innocence	and the corruption of worldly vanity.	4.6676412228072355
2576. incidentally one cannot	miss the significance of this gesture for dickens reintroduces it associatively	in pip's mind at another moral and psychological crisis-	his painful recognition in a talk with herbert pocket that his	hopeless attachment to estella is as self-destructive as it is romantic.	6.845474149654412
2577. in both cases the finger-post represents pip's heightened awareness	of contrary magnetisms.	10.597918453176668
2578. a variety of hand movements helps	dramatize the moral climate of the fallen world pip encounters beyond	the forge.	8.391898616931678
2579. the vulturelike attendance of the pocket family upon	miss havisham is summed up in the hypocritical gestures of miss camilla	pocket who puts her hand to her throat in a feigned spasm of	grief-stricken choking then lays it upon her heaving bosom with	an unnatural fortitude of manner and finally kisses it to	miss havisham in a parody of the lady's own mannerism toward estella.	4.748296250244733
2580. pumblechook's hands throughout the novel serve to travesty greed	and hypocritical self-aggrandizement.	7.615092762846159
2581. we first see him shaking mrs	joe's hand on discovering the sizable amount of the premium paid	to her husband for pip's indenture as an apprentice and later pumping	pip's hands for the hundredth time at least	in effusive congratulation to pip on	his expectations.	4.842494253168722
2582. we take leave of pumblechook as he gloats over pip's	loss of fortune extending his hand with a magnificently forgiving	air and exhibiting the same fat five fingers one of which	he identifies with the finger of providence and shakes at pip	in a canting imputation of the latter's ingratitoode and	his own generosity as pip's earliest benefactor.	5.465585752661384
2583. pip first learns the stupendous power of money from the	sycophantic tailor mr trabb whose brutality to his boy helper exactly	matches	the financial resource of each new customer and whose fawning	hands touch the outside of each elbow and rub	pip out of the shop.	4.764708082700959
2584. the respectability which money confers implies	a different etiquette and upon taking up the life of a london gentleman	pip must learn from herbert pocket that the spoon is not generally	used over-hand but under.	6.847109727921214
2585. the following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the	operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items:	channel unit combined channel and unit combined arm and file unit	record synchronizers inquiry synchronizers and alteration switches.	5.063043270737741
2586. the declarative operation equ is used to equate symbolic names	to item numbers.	9.838714388721492
2587. certain autocoder	statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained	in the operand of a single line on the autocoder	coding sheet.	5.348668535799134
2588. when this is the case the appropriate section of this	manual will indicate that continuation cards may be used.	10.93026778231761
2589. thus	when specifically permitted the operand of a given line on the autocoder	coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to	four additional lines which immediately follow.	4.903697760124407
2590. the label and	operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand	must begin in column 21; ie it must be left-justified in the	operand column of the coding sheet.	6.878913808064877
2591. the operand need not extend across	the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation	cards but may end with the comma following any parameter.	5.363198470112531
2592. remarks may	appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they	are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces.	9.09766010999487
2593. illustration	of the use of continuation cards are included throughout the	examples illustrating the various statements.	6.286624152054331
2594. if a continuation	card follows a statement that does not permit continuation cards	the compiler will generate a nop and issue an error message.	8.477847772553938
2595. additional	restrictions regarding the use of continuation cards with macro-instructions	appear on page 106.	6.712294971655874
2596. electronic switches	the assignment of actual addresses to symbolic	index word and electronic switch names occurs in phase 3 of the	autocoder processor.	6.365727389270327
2597. the initial availability of index words and electronic	switches is determined by a table which is included in the compiler	systems tape.	6.5806540713054185
2598. this table originally indicates that index words	1 through 96 and electronic switches 1 through 30 are available for	assignment to symbolic references; index words 97 through 99 are	not available.	6.454852290796788
2599. the initial setting of this table may be altered however	as described in the 70707074 data processing system bulletin	ibm 70707074 compiler system: operating procedure	form j28-6105.	5.589623670936844
2600. during the first pass of phase 3 references	to the actual addresses of index words and electronic switches	are collected and the availability table is updated.	8.197770509263021
2601. at the end	of this pass the table indicates which index words and electronic switches	are not available for assignment to symbolic references.	6.348118347385949
2602. both index words and electronic switches may have been made unavailable	before the start of assignment in one of the following ways:	the initial setting of the availability table indicated that the	index word or electronic switch was not available for assignment.	8.195034836507617
2603. the one- two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch	was used in the operand of a symbolic machine instruction to specify	indexing or as a parameter which is always an index word or electronic	switch eg   the one- or two-digit number of	the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of an equ	statement eg    when the index words or electronic	switches are reserved because of actual usage in the statements	described above the position or order of the statements within the program	is not important; any such reference will make the index word	or electronic switch unavailable at the end of this pass.	4.890238979642212
2604. during	the assignment pass of phase 3 index words and electronic switches	are reserved as they are encountered during assignment.	7.370185245535542
2605. index	words and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways.	6.545276911798704
2606. the first two methods apply to both index words and electronic switches;	the third applies only to index words.	8.53895081204111
2607. during the assignment	pass each instruction is examined for reference to the symbolic	name of an index word or electronic switch.	7.320447513387866
2608. when such a reference	is found an actual address is assigned and the availability table is	changed so that the assigned index word or switch is no longer available	for later assignment.	7.253451267906203
2609. if the one- or two-digit address of	an index word or electronic switch is used or is included in the operand	of an xreserve or sreserve statement	the corresponding index word or electronic switch is reserved.	5.788402210882935
2610. if a statement has been assigned an address in the index word	area  by means of an	origin statement which refers to an actual address the	corresponding index word will be reserved.	7.440882765898774
2611. these entries should normally	appear at the beginning of the program or immediately following each	litorigin statement.	9.2073821100599
2612. otherwise symbolic names may have	previously been assigned to these same index words.	8.18527692242169
2613. the preceding methods allow	efficient use of index words and electronic switches during a sectionalized	or multi-phase program particularly when used in conjunction	with the litorigin statement.	5.595178736654994
2614. extreme caution should	be used however to avoid the conflicting usage of an index word or electronic	switch which may result from the assignment of more than one	name or function to the same address.	7.007645576594056
2615. if the symbolic name or	actual address of an index word or electronic switch appears or is included	in the operand of an xrelease or srelease	statement the specified index word or electronic switch	will again be made available regardless of the method by which it	was reserved.	5.210395759378588
2616. it will not however be used for symbolic assignment until	all other index words or electronic switches have been assigned for	the first time.	10.014176698035447
2617. if at any time during the assignment pass	the compiler finds that there are no more index words available for assignment	the warning message no more index words available	will be placed in the object program listing the table will be altered	to show that index words 1 through 96 are available and the assignment	will continue as before.	5.7696796932705965
2618. if the compiler finds that there are	no more electronic switches available for assignment the warning message	no more electronic switches available will be placed in	the object program listing the table will be altered to show that electronic	switches 1 through 30 are available and assignment will continue	as before.	6.686420267397363
2619. the resultant conflicting usage of index words or electronic	switches may be avoided by reducing the number of symbolic names	used eg through the proper use of the equ xrelease	or srelease statements.	6.856548145758149
2620. as noted in appendix	c index words 97 through 99 are never available for assignment	to symbolic names by the compiler; also index words 93 through	96 may have been made unavailable for assignment.	7.3109638834438275
2621. statements	autocoder declarative statements provide the processor	with the necessary information to complete the imperative operations	properly.	5.9866825484836985
2622. declarative statements are never executed in the object program	and should be separated from the program instruction area placed	preferably at its beginning or end.	6.4823744915593045
2623. otherwise special care must be	taken to branch around them so that the program will not attempt to execute	something in a data area as an instruction.	5.560023031715399
2624. if the compiler does	encounter such statements a warning message will be issued.	10.72322358388218
2625. 70707074	autocoder includes the following declarative statements: da	dc drdw	dsw dline	equ code dtf	diocs	and duf.	5.825820622377272
2626. da dc	dtf and dline require more than one entry.	10.44706794030592
2627. the da statement is used to name and define the positions and	length of fields within an area.	6.5115766787898535
2628. the dc statement is used to name	and enter constants into the object program.	9.422915133740302
2629. since the 7070 and 7074	make use of record definition words to read write move	and otherwise examine blocks of storage the da and dc statements	provide the option of generating rdws automatically.	5.279986243667986
2630. when so instructed autocoder will generate one or more rdws	and assign them successive locations immediately preceding the area	with which they are to be associated.	9.010129818236337
2631. an rdw will be of the	form f where xxxx is the starting location of the area and yyyy	is its ending location.	6.532041082972151
2632. these addresses are calculated automatically	by the processor.	10.594780651883399
2633. in some cases it may be more advantageous	to assign locations to rdws associated with da and dc	areas in some other part of storage ie not immediately preceding	the da or dc areas.	6.0818745322272125
2634. the drdw statement may be	used for this purpose.	10.582206877639416
2635. the drdw statement may also be used to	generate an rdw defining any area specified by the programmer.	6.808258993355566
2636. as many as ten digital switches may be named and provided	by the dsw statement for consideration by the setsw and	logic macro-instructions.	8.461087188773208
2637. each switch occupies one digit position	in a word can be set on or off and is considered	as logically equivalent to an electronic switch.	5.217848998886126
2638. it cannot however	be referred to by electronic switch commands eg esn bsn	etc.	10.857911690220728
2639. an individual switch or the entire set of switches in	a word may be tested or altered as desired.	5.544401316257922
2640. through use of	the dline statement a means is provided for specifying both	the editing of fields to be inserted in a print line area and the layout	of the area itself.	6.5903627288638305
2641. the area may include constant information supplied	by the programmer.	9.691408780548091
2642. the area may also be provided with additional	data during the running of the object program by means of edmov	or move macro-instructions.	9.058265696455496
2643. the declarative statement	equ permits the programmer to equate symbolic names to actual	index words electronic switches arm and file numbers tape channel	and unit numbers alteration switches etc and to equate a symbol	to another symbol or to an actual address.	4.687215922478775
2644. the diocs	dtf and duf statements are used when required by the inputoutput	control system.	8.346523409839932
2645. diocs is used to select the major	methods of processing to be used and to name the index words used	by iocs.	6.400867349035739
2646. each tape file must be described by tape file specifications	produced by dtfs.	8.223277000023264
2647. in addition to information related	to the file and its records the file specifications contain subroutine	locations and the location of tape label information.	7.7692702543714525
2648. a duf	entry must be supplied for every unit record file describing the type	of file and the unit record equipment to be used.	6.911593772058188
2649. the duf also	supplies the locations of subroutines written by the user that are	unique to the file.	6.161534271336119
2650. a full description of the diocs	dtf and duf statements is contained in the 7070 data processing	system bulletin ibm 7070 inputoutput control system	form j28-6033-1.	8.358126438210919
2651. brief descriptions of these three declarative	statements and detailed descriptions of the formats and functions	of each of the other 70707074 autocoder declarative statements follow	below.	5.82519463735035
2652. when	the inputoutput control system is to be used in a program a	diocs statement must be used to select the major methods of processing	to be used.	9.355520245214203
2653. this statement also allows the naming of the index	words used by iocs.	7.245642828221304
2654. the basic	format of the diocs statement is as follows:  anylabel	is any symbolic label; it may be omitted.	8.251775376411436
2655. the entry diocs	must be written exactly as shown.	8.341215694113531
2656. the first item in the	operand iocsixf is used to specify the first iocs index	word for programs using tape files.	8.597417340887846
2657. this item may be a symbolic	name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range	3-94.	6.328325912493313
2658. if the first item in the operand is omitted the symbolic name	iocsixf will be assigned.	9.420738558882473
2659. when an actual index word or a	symbolic address is specified autocoder will equate the name iocsixf	to it.	6.186438963862652
2660. the second item in the operand iocsixg	is used to specify the second iocs index word for programs	using tape files.	7.682048778551802
2661. this item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit	or two-digit index word address in the range 3-94.	6.183966301200223
2662. if the second	item in the operand is omitted the symbolic name iocsixg	will be assigned.	9.789235504658443
2663. when an actual index word or a symbolic address	is specified autocoder will equate iocsixg to it.	6.345609006316045
2664. in the midwest oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment	of domestic sewage from suburban areas.	9.840946374000778
2665. the high cost of land	and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have	created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational	characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat	more organic matter per unit volume.	6.2038413982458795
2666. research at fayette missouri	on oxidation ponds has shown that the bod in the treated	effluent varied from 30 to 53 mgl with loadings from 8 to	120 lb boddayacre.	6.424135885208428
2667. since experience indicates that effluents	from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these bod	concentrations the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated	treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds.	5.452655230970084
2668. recent studies by weston and stack had indicated that a turbine	aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen	transfer.	7.2400370508582625
2669. their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3	to 4 lb of oxygenhrhp.	6.701018786004922
2670. o'connor and eckenfelder	discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes.	8.515652468252126
2671. they indicated that a 4-day retention aerated lagoon would give 60	to 76 per cent bod reduction.	7.210805058639721
2672. later eckenfelder increased	the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer	months.	9.320800707885818
2673. it appeared from the limited information available that the	aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity	of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree	of treatment in a smaller volume.	5.6333478737936415
2674. with	the development of the red bridge subdivision south of kansas city	missouri the developer was faced with the problem of providing adequate	sewage disposal.	9.60829237625108
2675. the sewage system from kansas city was not	expected to serve the red bridge area for several years.	6.1464908696889475
2676. this necessitated	the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with	an expected life from 5 to 15 yr.	8.345251576975276
2677. for the initial development an	oxidation pond was constructed as shown in figure 1.	9.379422340318634
2678. the oxidation pond	has a surface area of 4.	10.582206877639416
2679. 77 acres and a depth of 4 ft.	6.764147616291221
2680. the pond	is currently serving 1230 persons or 260 persons per acre.	9.005093323721033
2681. in the summer	of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted	obnoxious odors.	8.206079708398445
2682. it was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the	pond by regular additions of sodium nitrate until the temperature decreased	and the algae population changed from blue-green to green algae.	7.561315979692343
2683. the anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond	necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen	than by sodium nitrate.	5.670580783382225
2684. at the same time further expansion in the	red bridge subdivision required the construction of additional sewage	treatment facilities.	12.560622500171817
2685. the large land areas required for oxidation	ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer.	6.802931569028676
2686. it was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the	problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary	treatment for the additional development.	9.625044068038882
2687. the lack	of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompted the developer	to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility	for treating domestic sewage.	5.581517617895818
2688. the pilot plant was a circular lagoon	81 ft in diam at the surface and 65 ft in diam at the bottom	4 ft below the surface with a volume of 121000 gal.	6.553692419703626
2689. the	side slopes were coated with fiberglas matting coated with asphalt to	prevent erosion.	5.825820622377272
2690. the pilot lagoon was located as shown in figure 1	to serve the area just south of the existing housing area.	8.650325074844528
2691. the major	contributor was a shopping center with houses being added to the system	as the subdivision developed.	7.432493179009017
2692. the pilot lagoon was designed to handle	the wastes from 314 persons with a 4-day aeration period.	7.87588018922744
2693. initially	the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping center with the	domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18-month period.	5.254525271336449
2694. this	operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant with a slowly	increasing load over a reasonable period of time.	6.966367697860506
2695. the pilot	plant was equipped with a 3-hp turbine aerator.	8.907332140370261
2696. the	aerator had a variable-speed drive to permit operation through a range	of speeds.	7.391013650626644
2697. the sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered and	continuously recorded on 24-hr charts.	6.374057384651866
2698. the raw sewage was introduced	directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the	raw sewage with the aeration tank contents.	6.955804554600195
2699. the effluent was collected	through two pipes and discharged to the blue river through a surface	drainage ditch.	6.040227447879625
2700. composite samples were collected at	weekly intervals.	9.670406878971576
2701. the long retention period and the complete mixing	concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent.	7.388362954087809
2702. weekly samples would make any changes more readily discernible	than daily samples.	7.615092762846159
2703. the composite samples were normally collected	over a 6-hr period but an occasional 24-hr composite was made.	6.040227447879625
2704. examination of the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation	of the 6-hr composite samples with 24-hr operations.	7.002811256141389
2705. the	data indicated that the organic load during the 6-hr composites was	essentially 50 per cent of the 24-hr organic load.	7.613169571421967
2706. grab samples	were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its	operating conditions.	7.391013650626644
2707. efforts were made to take the grab samples at	random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6-hr	composite sample.	6.386391653003863
2708. a single 24-hr composite sample indicated that the	sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical.	7.88014969880378
2709. operations	the bod of the influent to the pilot plant varied	between 110 and 710 mgl with an average of 350 mgl.	6.092760097295938
2710. this was equivalent to 240 mglbod on a 24-hr basis.	11.350691961998146
2711. the	bod of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a	subdivision.	6.339593267021628
2712. the bod in the effluent averaged 58 mgl a 76-per	cent reduction over the 24-hr period.	7.860799503526907
2713. examination of the data	in table 1 shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent	bod.	5.556266996023954
2714. the periods of high effluent bod occurred during	cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted.	7.663024046550707
2715. ice caused the aerator to overload straining the drive belts.	6.210871206873012
2716. the	slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce	oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage.	8.242375935376941
2717. the	organic loading on the unit averaged 32 lb of bodday or about	2 lb bodday1000 cu ft aeration capacity.	5.15576524365156
2718. needless	to say the organic load was very low on a volumetric basis but was	270 lb boddayacre on a surface loading basis.	6.290129093830134
2719. it seems that	the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly	loaded activated sludge system.	7.719431741412256
2720. the flow rate remained relatively	constant during the winter months as shown in table 1.	9.71091530954216
2721. with	the spring rains the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open	sewers.	5.8846857302725235
2722. as construction progresses the volume of storm drainage will	be sharply reduced.	11.603955132301552
2723. the retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged	from 9.	7.839212140222358
2724. 6 days averaging 6.	12.394146838145783
2725. the large amount	of vegetable grindings from the grocery store in the shopping center	created a suspended solids problem.	6.549549937527686
2726. the vegetables were not readily metabolized	by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to float on	the surface.	7.333060553020843
2727. a skimming device at the effluent weir prevented loss of	most of these light solids.	6.708653314639865
2728. the average volatile suspended solids in	the effluent was 75 mgl while mlss averaged 170 mgl	volatile suspended solids.	7.960529186426104
2729. the average sludge age based on displacement	of solids was calculated to be 14.	7.0951425106264026
2730. the oxygen uptake rate	in the mixed liquor averaged 0.	9.945332631078985
2731. 8 mglhr during the first	four months of this study.	7.32293423922612
2732. variations in aerator speeds during the latter	two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen	demand.	6.643215071337043
2733. the increase in oxygen uptake rates from 1.	11.489145403071232
2734. 6 mglhr	which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to	be related to resuspension of solids which had settled at the lower	rotor speeds.	6.797475780076201
2735. it appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids	were active microbial solids with the heavier less active solids	settling out.	8.043593500078211
2736. the suspended solids discharged in the effluent	were found to be the major source of the bod.	8.886690034331954
2737. removal of the suspended	solids by a membrane filter yielded an average effluent containing	only 20 mgl bod.	5.326519577128725
2738. the bod in the drainage ditch	receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 mgl.	8.346523409839932
2739. this low bod	was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation	since the only dilution was surface runoff which was very low during	this study.	5.255118792764251
2740. routine microscopic examinations	were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by mckinney and	gram for the various types of protozoa.	7.356231877558946
2741. it was found that the	aerated lagoon was an activated sludge system rather than an oxidation	pond.	8.5129815528823
2742. at no time were algae found in the mixed liquor.	13.639820170647662
2743. the bacteria	formed typical activated sludge floc.	9.802060557618772
2744. the floc particles were all small	as the heavier floc settled out.	9.005093323721033
2745. initially the flagellated	protozoa predominated but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated	protozoa.	8.029519841016684
2746. as the temperature decreased the number of free swimming	ciliated protozoa decreased.	12.585716178468099
2747. very little protozoa activity existed	below 40`f.	9.35484721045803
2748. when the temperature reached 32`f all protozoan	activity ceased; but as the temperature rose the numbers of	protozoa increased rapidly.	9.450213239200245
2749. only once were stalked ciliates found in	the mixed liquor.	7.796565768573885
2750. the predomination of free swimming ciliated protozoa	is indicative of a high bacterial population.	8.82047645748646
2751. one of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen	transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator.	10.138682454736504
2752. routine determinations	were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen	uptake rates.	7.091561345451085
2753. the data given in table 2 show the routine operation	of the aerator.	6.817408452020724
2754. the dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently	high until january 29 1961.	8.346523409839932
2755. an extended cold spell caused	ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform	and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water.	5.668567926512969
2756. the added	resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen	transfer capacity.	8.477747475614223
2757. it was approximately one month before the belt	problem was noticed and corrected but at no time was there a deficiency	of dissolved oxygen.	6.894034524516866
2758. a series of eight special tests were	conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer	rate.	9.956092303905336
2759. five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to	simulate an ice cover.	7.521866993389534
2760. the rate of oxygen transfer at 1.	14.83532703533098
2761. 0-mgl	dissolved oxygen concentration and 10`c for various rotor speeds	is given in table 3.	5.674295354649883
2762. the maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.	10.582206877639416
2763. 0	mgl dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 lbday at a maximum	rate of 9.	5.674295354649883
2764. the actual power requirements indicated	2lb oxygen transferhrhp.	11.806889261435519
2765. the polyethylene cover reduced	the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent indicating that the maximum	oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface.	6.575589020825765
2766. pond	during this study septic conditions developed in the	oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted.	7.7472252938178
2767. shortly after this	study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of	sodium nitrate.	6.571940114745015
2768. the location of the oxidation pond in a high-value	residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer.	7.782659215118071
2769. the organic concentration in the influent raw sewage ranged from	160 to 270 mgl of bod with an average of 230 mgl.	6.46281560696641
2770. the bod data are given in table 4.	10.582206877639416
2771. a single 24-hr composite	sample had a bod of 260 mgl indicating a typical	domestic sewage.	6.211372457527363
2772. the daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged	147000 gpd giving a retention period of 42 days.	7.48837548295765
2773. the organic	loading on the pond was slightly under 60lbboddayacre.	7.839212140222358
2774. the effluent bod averaged 34 mgl a little lower	than that of the study at fayette indicated for a loading of 60lb	boddayacre.	7.57906676832516
2775. the bod of the effluent ranged from a	minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47mgl.	7.0636989512927855
2776. microscopic examination of	the effluent showed that minimum bod occurred when the algae began	to decrease with cold weather.	6.643215071337043
2777. when the algae began to build up	again the effluent bod rose.	8.540565160818552
2778. during the two weeks when the algae	disappeared from the effluent bod's in the effluent were 18	and 16 mgl.	8.768487718687751
2779. thus the three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations	are defense of shipping defense of naval forces and area defense.	6.088073323933754
2780. the last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and	near terminals and bases.	10.052907741076972
2781. to effect these operations five elements	exist	fixed installations.	9.119587473979069
2782. surface forces have been used to provide defense	zones around naval and merchant ship formations air to furnish area	surveillance and mines for protection of limited areas.	7.334849362012845
2783. submarines and	shore installations are new elements.	7.622507342753323
2784. the submarine now has a definite	place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to	ocean areas.	7.663024046550707
2785. fixed installations offer possibilities for area detection.	7.14162538120728
2786. mine warfare is being reoriented against submarine targets.	8.581436094141479
2787. a sixth element not always considered is intelligence.	8.023923068000494
2788. it includes	operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment.	0.0
2789. operational intelligence presumably will be available from our	national intelligence agencies; intelligence on the environment will	come from the recently augmented program in oceanography.	4.903693293796623
2790. the major	postwar development is the certainty that these elements should not be	considered singly but in combination and as being mutually supporting.	7.352410900831424
2791. thinking on submarine defense	has not always been clear-cut.	6.764147616291221
2792. proponents of single elements tend	to ensure predominance of that element without determining if it is justified	and the element with the most enthusiastic and vociferous proponents	has assumed the greatest importance.	6.796698519224445
2793. consequently air surface	and submarine elements overshadow the mine fixed installations	and intelligence.	6.063398628075623
2794. these have sought more and more of what they have.	12.113110325638354
2795. each seems to strive for elimination of the necessity for the others.	6.6813625361563895
2796. this despite postwar experience demonstrating that all elements are	necessarily mutually supporting.	9.198913718222784
2797. thus the most productive areas are	not necessarily the most stressed.	8.833286308908676
2798. this is stated to emphasize the necessity	for an over-all concept of submarine defense one which would	provide positions of relative importance to asw elements based on	projected potentialities.	8.046161153953731
2799. then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements	can be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward a common	objective.	6.361462262301334
2800. an over-all concept would have other advantages.	10.477725297338463
2801. it would	allow presentation to the public of a unified approach.	10.368684421273127
2802. now the problem	is presented piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily.	12.152571981005552
2803. while one	element	is announcing progress another is delineating its problems.	7.321972785933993
2804. the	result can only be confusion in the public mind.	10.824033822709982
2805. a unified concept	can serve as a guide to budgeting and if public support is gained will	command congressional support.	6.130963165601821
2806. industry's main criticism of the	navy's antisubmarine effort is that it cannot determine where any	one company or industry can apply its skills and know-how.	7.352561550041772
2807. lacking guidance	industry picks its own areas.	8.762426024314411
2808. the result coupled with the salesmanship	for which american industry is famous is considerable expenditure	of funds and efforts in marginal areas.	8.506140216384392
2809. an over-all concept	will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield	greatest dividends.	6.2338487675332335
2810. therefore a broad concept of over-all submarine	defense is needed for co-ordination of the navy's efforts for a logical	presentation to the public for industry's guidance and as a	basis for a program to the congress.	6.637234384017638
2811. concept	that which follows will be a discussion of principles	and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare.	6.109491189080505
2812. russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world divided	between her various fleets.	10.042467815380848
2813. some are also in albania and others	are on loan to egypt.	7.583775777699051
2814. other countries which may willingly or unwillingly	become communist can furnish bases.	8.26207590452333
2815. communist target areas can	be assumed but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide	with soviet intentions.	7.370310609769442
2816. attack can come from almost any direction against	many locations.	8.196044167676531
2817. logically then the first principle of the plan	must be that it is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical area.	6.646515052475208
2818. it is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while	building at bases in transit and on station.	9.995396910362448
2819. destruction of the enemy's	building and base complex however requires attacks on enemy	territory which is possible only in event of all-out hostilities.	5.693578257441505
2820. in	transit or on station it may not be possible to attack the submarines	until commission of an overt act.	8.02021381973691
2821. the communists are adept at utilizing	hostilities short of general war and will do so whenever it is	to their advantage.	6.49989374794633
2822. therefore the second principle of the plan must be	that while providing for all-out hostilities its effectiveness is	not dependent on general war.	7.262176264192017
2823. antisubmarine warfare does not involve	clashes between large opposing forces with the decision a result	of a single battle.	5.236383152695367
2824. it is a war of attrition of single actions	of an exchange of losses.	15.861792798818417
2825. this exchange must result in our ending up	with some effective units.	7.250862165373997
2826. initially having fewer units of some elements-	especially submarines- than the opponent our capabilities need	to be sufficiently greater than theirs so that the exchange will	be in our favor.	6.352388959314798
2827. therefore the third principle of the plan must be that	it does not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types	unless at an assured favorable exchange rate.	5.719195656854624
2828. the submarine	has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since	world war 2.	8.346523409839932
2829. its speed has increased it operates at increasingly	greater depths its submerged endurance is becoming unlimited and	it will become even more silent.	5.18742509826831
2830. the next developments will probably	be in weaponry.	13.314096035204095
2831. the missile can gradually be expected to replace the	torpedo.	9.204644232367036
2832. as detection ranges increase weapons will be developed to	attack other submarines and surface craft at these ranges.	8.197482826165501
2833. therefore	the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously	increasing capabilities in the opponent.	6.159638137837797
2834. no element can accomplish	the total objective of submarine defense.	9.76376045036682
2835. some elements support	the others	but all have limitations.	8.592800318346152
2836. some limitations of one element	can be compensated for by a capability of another.	8.114131125286105
2837. elements used	in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum	of the capabilities of the individual elements.	6.325311163473002
2838. therefore the plan's	fifth principle must be that it capitalize on the capabilities of	all elements in combination.	7.476488229392695
2839. conceivably the submarine defense	problem can be solved by sufficient forces.	6.210871206873012
2840. numbers would be astronomical	and current fiscal policies make this an impractical solution.	7.391013650626644
2841. shipbuilding aircraft procurement and weapon programs indicate that	there will not be enough of anything.	6.066941276481856
2842. therefore any measures taken	in peacetime which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute	greatly to success when hostilities occur.	6.748802289035621
2843. therefore the sixth	principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures	which will reduce future force requirements.	5.689166266815458
2844. the world is constantly	changing; what was new yesterday is obsolescent today.	12.321059980898383
2845. the	seventh principle of the plan is self-evident; it must be flexible enough	to allow for technological breakthroughs scientific progress and	changes in world conditions.	5.989795157616825
2846. to this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense	has been demonstrated the mission has been stated broad principles	delineating its content laid down and the supporting elements listed.	7.369551939108993
2847. before considering these elements in more detail an additional	requirement should be stated.	6.791049676473546
2848. large area coverage will accomplish all	other tasks.	9.30371038265301
2849. therefore because reduction in tasks results in reduction	of forces required the plan should provide for expanding area coverage.	5.406664019112
2850. but it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented	geographically.	16.794073807785615
2851. consequently the system giving area coverage	must be flexible and hence at least	partially mobile.	5.725106139771221
2852. since effective area coverage appears fairly remote	the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements:	air surface sub-surface fixed installations mines and intelligence.	6.6384731410985784
2853. these are arranged approximately in the order of the vociferousness	of their proponents but will be discussed in the reverse order	in the hope that the true order of importance will result.	7.873299667697262
2854. intelligence	as used herein will include information on possible	opponents and on the environment which can affect operations.	7.519188723481248
2855. these can	be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence.	8.010081924658726
2856. in submarine defense these must have maximum stress.	11.838405196350237
2857. good operational	intelligence can ensure sound planning greatly reduce force	requirements	and increase tactical effectiveness.	6.302470714181657
2858. environmental intelligence	is just as important.	10.472119682746735
2859. the ocean presently co-operates with the	target.	9.802060557618772
2860. full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the	environment to our side resulting in an increase in effectiveness of	equipment and tactics a decrease in enemy capabilities and the development	of methods of capitalizing on the environment.	6.343712616334543
2861. therefore improved	intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and as	it supports all other elements rates a top priority.	5.406664019112
2862. gathering intelligence	is important but of equal importance is its translation into	usable form.	7.391013650626644
2863. a program is needed to translate the results of oceanographic	research into tactical and operating instructions.	7.17999136448753
2864. approaching	this problem on a statistical basis is invalid because the opponent	has the same sources available and will be encountered not under	average conditions but under the conditions most advantageous to him.	6.3268751469330775
2865. therefore the on-the-scene commander must have detailed operating	instructions based on measurement of conditions in the area at the time	of encounter.	5.801816149505095
2866. all capabilities must be used to maximum advantage	then.	12.548120470661539
2867. temperature wind oxygen content depth bottom character and	animal life are the chief environmental variables.	5.90870224590401
2868. variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature	because more of the variables would be encompassed.	7.357756497138044
2869. these variations	must eventually be measured horizontally as well as vertically.	8.40276774381342
2870. progress in predicting water conditions is encouraging but little	guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information.	9.928013458050904
2871. a concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on	the spot.	6.62197242591231
2872. mine warfare has in the past been directed against	surface targets.	9.151803601223891
2873. by its nature it has always been of great psychological	advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater	counter-efforts.	6.357213028433671
2874. mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine	targets.	9.060328853487057
2875. they are still considered to be for use in restricted waters	however and targets must come within a few yards of them.	8.350340367640717
2876. mines	need to be recognized as a major element in anti-submarine warfare employment	extended to deep water and have their effective area per unit	increased.	6.38769540514313
2877. mines can be used to deny access to great areas; they	are difficult to counter cost little to maintain until required and	can be put into place quickly.	5.790072726947081
2878. a most attractive feature is that detection	and attack are combined in a single package.	8.405340457262655
2879. effective employment	will reduce force requirements.	8.254441635698543
2880. for example effective mine	barriers from florida to cuba and across the yucatan channel from	cuba to mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense	inshore patrol convoy escort shipping control and mine defense for	the entire gulf of mexico.	6.894498875494615
2881. more extended systems covering all passage	into the caribbean would free the caribbean and the gulf of mexico	from the previously listed requirements.	5.563375759127216
2882. systems covering the gulf	of st lawrence and possibly the entire coasts of the united	states are not impossible.	6.85267062431164
2883. such mine defense systems could permit concentration	of mobile forces in the open oceans with consequent increase	in the probability of success.	6.92578822529471
2884. the advantages inherent in mine warfare	justify as great an importance for this element as is accorded any	of the other elements.	7.068970569960655
2885. fixed installations are increasingly	advocated as the problem of area defense emerges.	6.771690794857863
2886. the proponents	are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence	on their military counterparts.	8.346523409839932
2887. systems which detect submarines over	wide areas are attractive although they can be only burglar alarms.	5.967602403211639
2888. mobile forces are required to localize and attack detected targets	since the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target.	7.39383563555266
2889. such systems	are expensive and are oriented geographically.	8.771033092947984
2890. in an over-all	asw concept dependence on and effort expended for such systems	should be limited to those with proven capabilities.	9.227902432166399
2891. no general installation	should be made until a model installation has been proved and	its maximum capability determined.	6.1207706529024115
2892. in addition proposals for fixed installations	should be carefully weighed against a counterpart mobile	system.	10.757927046801495
2893. for fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that	should be inherent in naval systems.	6.576251425143321
2894. the submarine has become	increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system.	9.430036403335416
2895. it operates	in its target's environment and any advantage gained therefrom	by the target is shared by the attacker.	7.724715166504337
2896. but the submarine is a weapon	of ambush and therefore always in danger of being ambushed.	9.742935294239802
2897. two metabolites	which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast	bacteria are biosynthesized from paba.	5.788801185383924
2898. the 7 carbons of paba	are incorporated directly into metabolite 2	.	9.430036403335416
2899. thirty-five of the 36	carbon atoms arise from paba.	6.764147616291221
2900. all 28 carbons of metabolite 1	arise from paba.	10.566937912973131
2901. metabolite 1 isolated from the medium however showed a lower specific	activity which indicates endogenous synthesis of this metabolite.	5.15576524365156
2902. vigorous acid hydrolysis of metabolite 1 destroyed the	biological activity of the compound and liberated two aryl amines.	6.643215071337043
2903. fragment a has been obtained in crystalline form as a dioxalate salt	and free base.	5.542917982132687
2904. preliminary evidence tentatively indicates that the	molecule is cleaved at a secondary amide bond.	7.198778874655976
2905. h sloane; chemical studies are being pursued with the cooperation	- research	on esterases in mammalian sera was continued.	5.714421194550266
2906. one of the most interesting	findings was the extreme sensitivity of plasma arylesterases to	rare earth ions.	12.941462857514958
2907. the inhibition of the enzyme by very low concentrations	of lanthanum ion is probably the strongest known biological effect	of rare earth salts.	5.71098065430772
2908. various metal ions have been found to protect plasma	arylesterase against inactivation by urea and guanidine.	8.401528899871506
2909. the effects	can be related to the structure of this -sh enzyme.	9.984412662365113
2910. the non-identity	of serum and red blood cell arylesterase was also established.	9.005093323721033
2911. furthermore the hydrolysis of paraoxon was studied in mammalian	sera and it was found that it is hydrolyzed by albumin	in addition to arylesterase.	6.134739308693741
2912. selective inhibitors can	distinguish the two activities.	9.818077947137997
2913. investigations on the acceleration of	human plasma cholinesterase were carried further.	6.210871206873012
2914. biophysical studies on	- electron-microscopical and physical-chemical	methods were used to demonstrate the renaturation of heat-denatured	collagen and ribonucleic acid.	7.21372885036404
2915. a method	was devised for extracting and purifying soluble earthworm collagen	.	7.190017756155806
2916. it was observed that ewc macromolecules are the	same diameter than	vertebrate tropocollagen.	13.123583514934909
2917. this unusual collagen also was shown to undergo	a reversible thermal phase transformation.	6.954879689604739
2918. this investigation	involved several aspects.	16.48682148135584
2919. substance z an active urinary	peptide was purified by extraction in organic solvents and repeated	column chromatography; high-voltage electrophoresis and paper chromatography	were used in preliminary structural studies; pharmacological	effects in vitro on isolated surviving organs and in vivo	on blood pressure were assayed; special equipment required for registering	respiration and for recording the contraction of smooth muscles	under various conditions was developed by the instruments section	; and enzymes	which terminate the action of peptides such as bradykinin and perhaps	substance z were studied.	4.193079706729175
2920. experiments are in progress to develop	ultraviolet spectrophotometric techniques for assaying these enzymes	and for studying their sensitivity to metal ions.	6.711839494474785
2921. c d mackey a g renfrew w b severs	- in a physiochemical study	of seed proteins the globulins of the brazil nut have been investigated.	5.2640668649253595
2922. in addition to the known principal globulin excelsin three	other ultracentrifugally distinct components have been observed.	13.016333920119122
2923. a	water-soluble protein of quite low molecular weight has	also been found in this system and partly characterized.	6.094905714546496
2924. on the basis of	a differentiability assumption in function space it is possible to prove	that for materials having the property that the stress is given by	a functional of the history of the deformation gradients the classical	theory of infinitesimal viscoelasticity is valid when the deformation	has been infinitesimal for all times in the past.	8.22990109267718
2925. by strengthening	the differentiability assumption it has been possible to derive second	and higher order theories of viscoelasticity.	6.388589539526145
2926. in the second-order	theory one of the normal stress differences can be calculated from the	first-order stress relaxation function.	10.042047327287436
2927. an extensive series of	measurements was made on a high-density polyethylene in a torsion pendulum	instrument using forced sinusoidal oscillation free vibration and	creep measurements over the temperature range of f to 80`c.	4.816956594793347
2928. as many as seven decades of the time scale were thus covered isothermally.	13.145135728649471
2929. the simple time-temperature equivalence valid for many amorphous	systems did not hold here.	7.491986582426858
2930. it was possible however to decompose	the compliance into a sum of a frequency-independent component and two	viscoelastic mechanisms each compatible with the boltzmann superposition	principle and with a consistent set of time-temperature equivalence	factors.	7.815674469999594
2931. and related	- the results of microanalysis of tektites	for gallium and germanium have shown that	these glasses are probably produced from terrestrial	matter by impact of a celestial body.	5.615440609795537
2932. the galliumgermanium	ratio is higher than that for ordinary igneous metamorphic or sedimentary	matter as a result of selective volatilization of the components	of the tektite.	8.573782880155465
2933. gallium oxide is less volatile than silica	and germanium oxide is more volatile.	5.825820622377272
2934. australites	give the appearance of a second	melting.	12.06721634463939
2935. in conformity with this conclusion a higher trace gallium	content was found in the portion that has undergone a second	melting.	6.918024593705916
2936. the silicate fractions of stony meteorites show galliumgermanium	ratios similar to those of tektites because they too have undergone	melting at some point in their histories.	8.152513571606534
2937. libyan desert silica-glass	another natural glass is composed of nearly pure silica	and has the same trace germanium content as sands in the area.	4.903693293796623
2938. the gallium	content however has been enhanced five-fold.	11.387658710676023
2939. this glass is probably	formed from libyan desert sands by comet or stony-meteorite	impact.	6.954879689604739
2940. nickel-iron meteorites with sufficient kinetic energy	to produce large terrestrial-explosion craters may nevertheless melt only	small quantities of material.	6.643215071337043
2941. most of the impact energy is spent	in crushing and fragmentation.	11.413496497053176
2942. when rapid quenching follows melting	impact glasses may result.	11.488842477267742
2943. these always contain metallic inclusions.	9.993906161063114
2944. impact glasses not containing elemental nickel-iron may have been	produced by stony meteorites or comets.	7.032105024464237
2945. no meteorites have ever been	recovered from paleoexplosion craters and recent craters containing	impact glass have all been produced by metallic meteorites with the exception	of aouelloul crater adrar western sahara desert.	4.9552960254551754
2946. this	crater contains impact glass with no metallic inclusions and no meteoritic	material has been recovered.	7.032105024464237
2947. preparation of a coordination compound is often	accomplished by the simple method of reacting a metal salt with a	ligand in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol.	4.785390059535166
2948. by applying this general	principle a great number of complex compounds of osmium ruthenium	iridium and rhenium with triphenylphosphine triphenylarsine	and triphenylstibine	have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few	years.	7.24670187723743
2949. in the absence of direct evidence to the contrary decomposition of	solvent alcohol and coordination of its fragments to the metal were	not considered following the above heretofore-accepted assumption in	preparative coordination chemistry.	6.290438088796698
2950. recent work with radiocarbon and	deuterated alcohols as solvents however has given evidence that metal-hydrido	and -carbonyl complexes may be readily formed by reaction	with alcohol in some of these systems.	7.456443453887742
2951. some of the previously reported	compounds have thus been reformulated and a series of new hydrido and	carbonyl compounds discovered the more representative examples being	f f f f and f.	6.912542543615947
2952. the coordination complexes	formed by transition metals with primary and secondary phosphines and	arsines are being investigated.	7.860799503526907
2953. particular interest	is directed towards the condensation of these ligands with metal	halides to form substituted phosphide or arside complexes.	5.15576524365156
2954. during the	past year these ligands have yielded some unusual five-coordinate complexes	of nickel and some interesting binuclear phosphorus-bridged	complexes of palladium as well as new compounds	of the well-known type f.	7.463903078947821
2955. the structures properties and reactions	of these compounds are being studied.	7.559893176392705
2956. in another study	chromium-substituted aluminum oxyhydroxides and related species prepared	homogeneously by high-temperature hydrolysis are being characterized	and investigated spectrally in the ultraviolet region with a view	to identification and semiquantitative estimation of the phases formed	under varying preparative conditions.	6.4379704660999675
2957. _elasticity	- the theory of elasticity of	gaussian networks has been developed on a more general basis and the	equations of state relating variables of pressure volume temperature	stress and strain have been precisely formulated.	4.810368095862098
2958. simple elongation	has been treated in detail.	9.670406878971576
2959. the various stress-temperature coefficients	for constancy of volume and strain constancy of pressure and strain	and constancy of pressure and length have been interrelated.	5.624564446073024
2960. the	dilation accompanying elongation and the simultaneously developed anisotropy	of compressibility have been related to the elongation.	7.626829793242358
2961. in continuation	of these theoretical studies a more precise elucidation of	the effects of imperfections in network structure is sought.	6.144849616704715
2962. chain conformations of polymeric	- recent theoretical work to calculate the dimensions	of polymeric chains by volkenstein and lifson has been extended to include	more general types of chains.	6.186898478723534
2963. the mean-square end-to-end distance	of the polyisobutylene chain has been calculated in reasonable agreement	with values deduced from viscosity data.	5.780140237098333
2964. these studies are being	extended to different polymers to increase our knowledge about the	hindrances to rotation around chain bonds.	7.153483977539913
2965. the crystallization of copolymers comprising f units interspersed	with a minor percentage of f is limited by the inability of the	crystal lattice characteristic of the former to accommodate the bulky	side group of the latter.	5.918390288898053
2966. only uninterrupted sequences of the former	are eligible for formation of crystallites.	8.962620827604098
2967. limitations on the lengths	of these sequences diminish the stability of the comparatively short	crystallites which can be formed and this is reflected in a broadening	of the melting range.	6.07038760772742
2968. carefully executed melting studies on this system	permit quantitative estimation of the instability	engendered by reduced crystallite length.	6.757567981697296
2969. the complex morphology of	polycrystalline homopolymers is necessarily dependent on the same factor.	8.594270015414326
2970. hence the present studies offer a possible basis for interpretations	in the latter field.	9.031728760064738
2971. glycerinated	muscle in the presence of the physiological agent.	8.497029033662841
2972. responsible	for delivering energy to the mechanochemically active proteins	of muscle has been shown to undergo a contraction which is highly sensitive	both to temperature and to solvent composition in mixtures of	alcohols and water.	5.795373458792256
2973. experiments carried out over long periods of time	in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the	onset of contraction and its completion are confined to an interval of	several degrees centigrade and to a concentration range of only several	per cent.	4.790021212810407
2974. the contraction therefore partakes of the character of	a phase transition.	9.430036403335416
2975. while atp appears to be necessary for the	occurrence of contraction its presence and enzymatic hydrolysis of it	by the muscle protein myosin are not the only criteria for contraction.	6.006509264093857
2976. one of the principal aims of anionic polymerization techniques	is the synthesis of polymers of extremely narrow molecular weight	distribution.	10.953923197699167
2977. a simple process for the preparation of nearly monodisperse	polystyrene of predictable molecular weight has been developed.	5.901300571347011
2978. the preparation of such products is not new but the systems heretofore	employed in polymerizations have commanded considerable experimental	skill and starting materials of a high purity.	7.144428852003552
2979. in the new process	impurities present in the solvent the monomer and in the	reaction system which would cause deactivation of propagation centers	are rendered inactive prior to polymerization by gradual addition of	initiator a mixture of butyl-lithium and telomeric styryl-lithium at	a temperature low enough to suppress chain growth.	5.514885465856123
2980. upon completion	of the purging step additional initiator appropriate for the molecular	weight of the sample desired is added and the system is then warmed	to the polymerization temperature at which the reaction is allowed	to go to completion.	6.51076062562578
2981. the predictability of the molecular weights was	found to be within 10% for the polymers prepared with f ratios less	than 1.	5.571976520698639

3096. critical evaluation of all data compiled is not a primary aim of this	project.	7.935508743752098
3097. however the proposed correlation of the many interrelated	properties of crystals will reveal discrepancies in the recorded data	and suggest areas for reinvestigation.	6.272606309499311

3099. physical	for punched-card or tape storage of information all	literature values must be conformed to a common language.	5.473954887180538
3100. in this	way a degree of unification of nomenclature symbols and units will be	realized.	10.080523213791063
3101. because individual classes of foods differ in their requirements	for preservation a number of methods have been developed over the years	involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration	fermentation salting chemical treatment canning refrigeration and	freezing.	5.719067707831121
3102. the basic objectives in each instance are to make available	supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter	to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and	insects and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of	harvest or production to areas of consumption.	6.98455210734029
3103. in earlier years	the preservation of food was essentially related to survival.	7.764524855587911
3104. in	the more sophisticated atmosphere of today's developed nations food-preservation	techniques have sought also to bring variety peak freshness	and optimum taste and flavor in foods at reasonable cost to the	comsumer.	6.087154974475937
3105. with the development of nuclear technology isotopic	materials and machine radiation sources in recent years the possibilities	of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted	the attention of investigators in the united states and throughout	the world.	7.434975307084773
3106. an early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate	answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon dispelled.	7.926222413188676
3107. interest remained however in the possibility that it would serve	as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses	and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing or	without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations.	5.004280946492509
3108. the chief	factors responsible for the spoilage of fresh foodstuffs are microorganisms	such as bacteria molds and yeasts insects	sprouting and chemical reactions.	7.679939295969844
3109. microorganisms are often	responsible for the rapid spoilage of foods.	6.698212654347557
3110. of special concern is	the growth of bacteria such as clostridium botulinum which generate	poisonous products.	8.825011300776067
3111. enzymatic action in stored food produces changes	which can adversely affect the appearance of food or its palatability.	5.81866042908065
3112. spoilage by chemical action results from the reaction of one group	of components in the food with others or with its environment as in	corrosion of the walls of metal containers or the reaction of fats with	oxygen in the air to produce rancidity.	6.388572225022519
3113. sprouting is a naturally	occurring phenomenon in stored potatoes onions carrots beets	and similar root vegetables.	5.542917982132687
3114. insect infestation is a problem of importance	chiefly in stored grain.	9.478204968151388
3115. the presence of parasitic organisms	such as trichinella spiralis in pork introduces another factor which	must be dealt with in food processing.	6.527787621701744
3116. to permit the storage	of food for long periods of time a method of preservation must accomplish	the destruction of microorganisms and inhibition of enzymatic	action.	7.9028072183209686
3117. the term sterilization applies to methods involving essentially	complete destruction of all microorganisms.	7.1608087034330055
3118. food treated in	this manner and protected from recontamination by aseptic methods of packaging	and containment presumably could be stored for long periods without	refrigeration.	6.635988228731769
3119. the process of pasteurization involves milder	and less prolonged heat treatment which accomplishes the destruction	of most but not all of the microorganisms.	7.570289442277925
3120. less severe thermal	treatment as by blanching or scalding serves to inactivate enzymes.	8.015211952457786
3121. effects of ionizing radiation	ionizing radiation can cause	the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage	or at lower doses can inhibit their action.	4.853876284793092
3122. it furnishes a means	of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain parasitic	organisms present in meats.	9.344674831222017
3123. deactivation of enzymes is also	possible although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 mrad	or more.	5.326519577128725
3124. because of undesirable flavors odors colors and generally	low palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude	the inactivation of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation	by the conventional heat-processing methods of blanching.	7.099659194319115
3125. radiation does not retard the chemical spoilage of food.	6.460370037324521
3126. it will	however inhibit the sprouting of potatoes and other root vegetables.	10.869444022902801
3127. the radiation doses required for the preservation of foods	are in the following ranges:  for radiosterilization to destroy	all organisms for long-term preservation- about 4.	5.916343226482999
3128. 5 mrad for	nonacid foods of low salt content.	11.894105583821753
3129. for radiopasteurization	to partially destroy microorganisms; results vary with types of food	storage conditions and objectives of treatment- commonly of the	order of 0.	5.808866235652457
3130. 2 mrads but up to about 0.	14.411919543913791
3131. for	destruction of insects- about 25000 rads.	7.622507342753323
3132. for inhibiting	the sprouting of root vegetables- 4000 to 10000 rads.	9.816367117220269
3133. preserving foods with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable side	effects particularly at the higher radiation dosages.	5.326519577128725
3134. in this respect	the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized	foods has to date been found to be low in comparison with	fresh and commercially processed foods.	7.593689736903686
3135. a number of foods are quite	acceptable as regards taste and palatability however at dosages substantially	less than sterilization levels.	7.123467306335329
3136. moreover the nutritive value	of irradiated foods apparently undergoes little if any change although	some of the fat-soluble vitamins are affected by sterilization	doses.	7.431242172740858
3137. for irradiation of food the results	obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation	and x-ray gamma and high-energy electron radiation are suitable.	5.635679345667413
3138. aside from availability and economic considerations each has certain	practical advantages; for example gamma rays give deeper penetration	but cannot be focused or collimated whereas unidirectional electron	beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the	food package to be irradiated.	6.3898820060448465
3139. selection of a source for commercial irradiation	would involve consideration of numerous factors including required	dose rate load factor throughput convenience safety and most	important costs.	4.853876284793092
3140. of the potentially useful sources of ionizing	radiations gamma sources cobalt-60 cesium-137 fission products	or a reactor irradiation loop system using a material such as an indium	salt have received most attention for food-preservation systems.	6.796228521202161
3141. of the various particle accelerators the van de graff machines resonant	transformers and linear accelerators are the principal ones available	for commercial use.	6.55782030867378
3142. costs of the effective energy produced	by these sources is a major obstacle in the development of food-preservation	processes.	9.271403564062782
3143. estimated production costs of radiation energy	from machine and nuclide sources range from $1 to $10 per kwhr.	5.236383152695367
3144. conventional	energy for processing foods is available in the range of	at most a few cents per kwhr for electric power and the equivalent	of a few mills per kwhr for process steam.	6.559180980563432
3145. radiation therefore is	at an initial cost disadvantage even though only 1 to 10 per cent as	much radiation energy as heat energy is required for radiopasteurization	or radiosterilization.	5.407323869298529
3146. what are the possibilities of lowered radiation	production costs for the future?	13.69055793383496
3147.  it has been estimated that for	applications on a megawatt scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood	of 10 cents per kwhr for large-scale accelerators or for	gamma radiation generated in a reactor core.	5.970744407689593
3148. no comparable reductions	in the cost of nuclide radiation are foreseen.	10.594314053604894
3149. such projections however	appear highly	speculative and the capacities involved are far beyond	those foreseen for food-preservation facilities.	6.113769289643686
3150. because agricultural	activities are seasonal and the areas of production and harvest	of many foods are widely scattered geographically and because of	the high cost of transporting bulk food items any substantial distance	to a central processing location the use of large central processing	stations where low-cost radiation facilities approaching the megawatt	range might be utilized is inherently impracticable.	6.249974144697622
3151. of irradiation preservation of foods	the objective of complete	sterilization of foods is to produce a wholesome and palatable product	capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods	of time.	5.618424604867241
3152. chief interest in radiosterilization resides in the military	services.	9.390603782275125
3153. for them providing appetizing food under battle or emergency	conditions is a paramount consideration.	6.800157167832778
3154. they require completely	sterile foods capable of being stored without refrigeration preferably	items already cooked and ready to eat.	7.685753391288286
3155. high nutritional value variety	palatability and appetizing appearance are important for reasons	of morale.	6.80337331187083
3156. foods for rear stations which require cooking but no refrigeration	are also of interest.	7.322582207589122
3157. of primary interest are meats.	12.351857851149944
3158. radiopasteurization which produces fewer adverse sensory changes	in food products has potential usefulness in prolonging the keeping	qualities of fresh and refrigerated food items.	6.221143152558621
3159. thus food so processed	might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more	produce at peak freshness and palatability.	5.936991473365929
3160. commercial interest is chiefly	in this type of treatment as is military interest under peacetime	conditions.	7.775458885858585
3161. the present status of food preservation by ionizing	radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs.	7.20427560805382
3162. the radiation processing of meat has received extensive	investigation.	11.107107959362367
3163. to date the one meat showing favorable results at	sterilization doses is pork.	6.892147632398339
3164. of particular interest to the military	services is the demonstration that roast pork after radiosterilization	is superior in palatability to available canned pork products.	7.836394009972727
3165. tests	with beef have been largely unsuccessful because of the development	of off-flavors.	6.9253581715417205
3166. a prime objective of the army quartermaster corps	program is to find the reasons for beef's low palatability and means	of overcoming it since it is a major and desirable dietary item.	9.627908346520304
3167. partly	because low-level heat treatment is needed to inactivate enzymes	before radiosterilization treated fresh meats have the appearance of	boiled or canned meat.	5.0176589645046334
3168. off-flavor is a less severe problem with	the radiopasteurization of meats but problems of commercial acceptability	remain.	6.886249538313906
3169. moderate radiation doses of from 100000 to 200000 rads	can extend the shelf life of fresh beef from 5 days	to 5 or 6 weeks.	4.853876284793092
3170. however the problem of consumer acceptability remains.	15.673572866548046
3171. the preradiation blanching process discolors the treated beef	and liquid accumulates in prepackaged cuts.	6.578982329721101
3172. cooked beef irradiated in	the absence of oxygen assumes an unnatural pink color.	7.391013650626644
3173. when lamb	and mutton are irradiated at substerilization doses the meat becomes	dehydrated the fat become chalky and again unnatural changes in	color occur.	5.703434887995785
3174. ground meats such as fresh pork sausage and hamburger	have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration and radiopasteurization	might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping	qualities.	6.252533361664298
3175. however a major problem here is one of scale of processing;	ground meats are usually prepared from scrap meats at the local	level whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would require	central processing and distribution facilities.	5.407362030088933
3176. the problems of	color change by blanching and liquid accumulation within the package are	the same as for solid cuts.	8.333362590655405
3177. specialty cooked items containing	meat portions as in frozen dinners might offer a potential use	for radiopasteurization.	5.427950274147271
3178. the principal potential advantage would be	that the finished product could be transported and stored at lower cost	under refrigeration instead of being frozen.	7.112393625717184
3179. a refrigerated item	could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen	foods of the same type.	6.102983128436069
3180. competitive processes for preserving	meats are by canning and freezing.	8.196044167676531
3181. costs of canning meat are in the	range of 0.	7.355680552736413
3182. 8 to 5 cents per pound; costs of freezing are in the area	of 2 to 3.	8.173275019763205
3183. the table on page 10 shows costs of canning	and freezing meat and estimated costs for irradiation under certain	assumed conditions.	5.670580783382225
3184. under the conditions of comparison it will	radiosterilization is more	radiopasteurization by either the electron accelerator or cesium-137	irradiation	using the nuclide source is more expensive than use of an electron accelerator.	7.431230425092606
3185. results of irradiation tests with poultry have	been quite successful.	6.460370037324521
3186. at sterilizing doses good palatability results	with a minimum of changes in appearance taste and odor.	9.690103204771864
3187. radiopasteurization	has also been successful and the shelf life of chicken	can be extended to a month or more under refrigerated storage as compared	with about 10 days for the untreated product.	5.023232342000959
3188. acceptable taste and	odor are retained by the irradiated and refrigerated chicken.	7.615092762846159
3189. acceptance	of radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed however for two	reasons: the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration	is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved sanitation	and distributing practices and treatment by antibiotics a measure	already approved by the federal food and drug administration	serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 0.	4.916963481981913
3190. fresh seafood products are extremely	perishable.	10.472119682746735
3191. although refrigeration has served to extend the storage	life of these products substantially increased consumption might be possible	if areas remote from the seacoast could be served adequately.	5.409173123205315
3192. furthermore it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms	possible.	8.066087806204921
3193. the instrument is shown in fig 1 and consists	essentially of a hard sharp tungsten carbide knife which is pushed	along the substrate to remove the coating.	6.1087530504434815
3194. the force required to accomplish	removal is plotted by means of an electronic recorder against	distance of removal.	8.458510492086722
3195. since the removal force is a function of coating	thickness a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into	the instrument to accurately measure film thickness.	5.673086325235781
3196. this too is	recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously	cut.	8.610921896061667
3197. a number of adjustment features are included in the hesiometer	to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited	on such substrates as iron and other metals glass wood and	plastic surfaces.	6.226849784191787
3198. the measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily	be carried out.	9.005093323721033
3199. hesiometer results have been found to compare	excellently with manual knife scratching tests.	6.9463712601859715
3200. the instrumental	method however is about 100 times more sensitive and yields numerical	results which can be accurately repeated at wil over a period of time.	7.936307284371113
3201. if a wedge-shaped coating of increasing thickness is removed from	a substrate by an instrument like the hesiometer with a knife of constant	rake angle a number of removal mechanisms are often observed	which depend upon the thickness of the coating.	5.617220309501041
3202. at low thicknesses a	cutting phenomenon is often encountered.	11.71351514332805
3203. as the coating	becomes thicker the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of	failure.	7.544677787280255
3204. if the coating becomes still thicker a peeling type failure	finally can occur.	10.72322358388218
3205. the typical appearance of these various mechanisms	is illustrated in figs 2 3 and 4 which are single frame enlargements	of high speed movies taken during the course of the knife removal	process.	5.972641820047624
3206. it can be seen from fig 2 that the cutting removal	of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the	coating.	10.065540309426087
3207. the molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are	obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and	failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife	and extending to the coating surface.	5.322154394325318
3208. the pictures of figs	3 and	4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating	is detached by failure in a region at or close to the interface between	coating and substrate.	6.714092963077151
3209. if the force required to remove the	coatings is plotted against film thickness a graph as illustrated schematically	in fig 5 may characteristically result.	6.165702921912899
3210. here h	is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the	substrate and t is the film thickness.	9.909658482959113
3211. it can be seen that	the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly	from cutting to cracking to peeling removal.	8.959321006754546
3212. also it can be readily	seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state	response while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature.	7.0145225515164125
3213. it should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the	same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of	changes in coatings thickness.	7.63296546060657
3214. presumably the interfacial bond strength	and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case.	7.290347670517163
3215. what then	are the factors that contribute to these phenomena?	8.172042307755929
3216.  why should	the practical adhesion of a coating as assessed by a knife method	change initially increasing rather rapidly and then decreasing stepwise	to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing	thickness?	6.073238484235858
3217. 	the	cutting removal process has been previously described.	7.14162538120728
3218. it was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely	by cohesive failure.	12.101549542797414
3219. the details of the removal process are shown	schematically in fig 6.	9.942667879566706
3220. the various forces result from the reaction	of the removed paint chip against the face of the knife and along	the shear plane which makes an angle |f with the substrate.	7.839984668539578
3221. the	action and reaction forces are r and f respectively and	are equal and opposite in direction.	5.504013763918864
3222. all the other force vectors are	derived from these.	14.75695949617052
3223. f is the force required to cut a coating of thickness	t from the substrate.	6.195671823596846
3224. f is the shear force along the shear	plane; f and f are the thrust forces acting against coating	and knife respectively; f is the normal compressive force acting	on the shear plane; f is the friction force between chip and knife	surfaces and p is the normal force acting on the face of the	knife.	5.815072742533981
3225. |a is the rake angle of the knife; |f is the angle	the shear plane makes with the substrate; |t is the friction	angle; and |b is the angle the resultants make with the plane of	the substrate.	4.473134263127645
3226. an analysis of the vector relationships shows	that the rake angle |a and the friction angle |t determine	the vector direction f of the force resultants r and f.	7.056142647473741
3227. consequently	both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction	occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the	knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting	removal process.	6.534303111787784
3228. it is difficult to measure the direction	and magnitude of r directly.	19.069878647075285
3229. in actual practice the values most	readily amenable to measurement are the cutting force f and the	shear angle |f.	6.144849616704715
3230. these two values and the rake angle |a are	sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships.	8.798547020654512
3231. |a is defined by the geometry of the knife; |f can readily	be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after	cutting from the substrate; f is instrumentally determined.	4.926198120782607
3232. from	fig 6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be	derived and the cutting force is f where |l is the shear strength	of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material w	is the width of the removed coating and t is its thickness.	5.881729196226396
3233. if the cutting force f is plotted against film thickness	a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope	f.	6.517396121441633
3234. however in the actual assessment of the cutting force by instrumental	methods for any thickness of coating a number of spurious effects	occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured	value larger than the true cutting force indicated by eqn.	0.0
3235. one of these is the fact that the knife employed no	matter how well sharpened will have a slightly rounded cutting edge.	10.390780708029016
3236. this signifies that |a the rake angle is no longer a constant	to zero film thickness.	9.06649552733653
3237. the curvature of this bluntness is in the	case of the carboloy knife employed in the hesiometer determined by	the grain sizes of the polished grit and the tungsten carbide crystals	cemented together in the knife body and is in the order of 0.	6.442923355315638
3238. the force vector concept of fig 6 can readily be	applied to this condition also.	8.483713382005185
3239. because the rake angle f at the tip	of the knife is very much smaller when compared	to the value of |a for the major portion of the knife a very rapid	increase in cutting force with thickness will result.	6.188890245149814
3240. this reduces	to the relationship: f where f is the intercept at zero thickness	of the extrapolation of the slope indicated in eqn f is the	thickness of the coating equivalent to the rounding off of the knife	tip f is a straight line first approximation of this roundness and	the other symbols are equivalent to those of eqn.	6.150998561151396
3241. it can be	seen that f is a constant and is determined for the most part by the	geometry of the knife.	8.580937438440444
3242. the blunter the knife the higher is the value	of f.	9.430036403335416
3243. the importance of a hard abrasion resistant knife material	like the carboloy employed in the hesiometer immediately becomes	apparent.	6.788627930487371
3244. softer knives would blunt very rapidly making the value of	f inexact.	7.615092762846159
3245. in extreme cases of very soft knives this value may even	change during the course of a measurement.	8.516670420680711
3246. a second	factor which enters into the practical measurement of the instrumentally	determined cutting force is the frictional resistance caused	by the bottom of the knife against the substrate.	7.522740496252002
3247. this is not a constant	value like f but varies with the thickness of the coating and the	direction and magnitude of the resultants r and f of fig	6.	7.607171463682988
3248. under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip exerts a thrust	f against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or	lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of f.	7.349134743676916
3249. the resultant friction force f is thus directly proportional to	f and consequently also to film thickness.	6.161534271336119
3250. the value of f	can readily be assessed by determining the frictional force exerted	on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track	under various external loadings.	7.391760813846135
3251. a straight line relationship is usually	observed in a plot of f against load l having slope k	and f since the load l under actual cutting conditions	is caused by f it can be seen that f   the measured force	h in cutting removal of coatings from their substrates consequently	can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the	coating f that due to the bluntness of the knife f and that due	to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate f	or f the first two forces are directly interrelated and depend	upon film thickness whereas f is independent of these two and is a	constant for a given knifecoating combination.	4.820942016153744
3252. these theoretical	relationships are more clearly illustrated in fig 7 and their	sum can be seen to correlate in form with practical measurements made	with the hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion of fig 5	for the cutting mechanism.	7.517477050756409
3253. although a large number of coatings systems	particularly at low thicknesses fail cohesively by the cutting mechanism	frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place.	6.658768457673502
3254. this is a chipping dynamic type failure encountered with very brittle	coatings resins or very highly pigmented films.	10.056703068196963
3255. this is shown in	the photomicrograph of fig 8.	12.028312619574876
3256. the basic difference between	the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the chipping mechanism	is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously	without fracture rupture intermittently occurs along the	shear plane.	7.471800079255708
3257. the detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been	studied extensively by merchant for metal cutting and the principles	found can be directly applied to coatings.	6.319948449042945
3258. by studying	high speed movies made of this type of failure the sequence of relationships	as schematically illustrated in fig 9 could be observed.	8.870772111304845
3259. in the first picture the knife is just beginning to advance	into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip	formation.	7.523963690989004
3260. in the next the shear plane angle is high and extends to	the inclined work surface.	10.739140770264825
3261. with increasing advance of the knife into	the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear	angle rapidly decreases.	5.838619445834961
3262. eventually rupture occurs along the shear	plane and the cycle repeats itself.	8.106037171194833
3263. merchant	has found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry	and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be	applied to the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper values	of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional	area are used.	5.51153769381625
3264. consequently if the shear angle |f	is replaced by the rupture angle f the relationships as described in	eqns will directly apply.	6.406051459100846
3265. mechanism	under equilibrium cutting conditions the chip exerts a	force f against the coating and an equal opposite force f against	the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in fig 6.	5.772533502858223
3266. if the	rake angle |a of the knife is high enough and the friction angle	|t between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low	enough to give a positive value for f the resultant vector r	will lie above the plane of the substrate.	8.059278969844982
3267. within only a few years foamed plastics materials have managed	to grow into an integral and important phase of the plastics industry-	and the end is still not yet in sight.	6.457755946111507
3268. urethane foam as only	one example was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955.	8.525583087680541
3269. yet last year's volume probably topped 100 million lb and expectations	are for a market of 275 million lb by 1964.	5.485931181203066
3270. many of the other	foamed plastics particularly the styrenes show similar growth potential.	12.278358887072866
3271. and there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be	evaluated.	10.436154828200001
3272. as this issue goes to press for example one manufacturer	has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength;	another reports that a cellular polypropylene primarily for use	in wire coating applications is being investigated.	6.385677499349384
3273. on the	following pages each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described	in detail as to properties applications and methods of processing.	6.851886196020947
3274. it might be well to point out however some of the newer	developments that have taken place within the past few months which	might have a bearing on the future of the various foamed plastics involved.	12.105711476534378
3275. in urethane foams for example there has been a definite trend	toward the polyether-type materials	and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot	molding.	6.997230691079737
3276. most manufacturers also seem to be concentrating on formulating	fire-resistant or self-extinguishing grades of urethane foam that	are aimed specifically at the burgeoning building markets.	7.414876302737737
3277. urethane	foam as an insulator is also coming in for a good deal of attention.	8.359944943702645
3278. in one outstanding example whirlpool corp found that by switching	to urethane foam insulation they could increase the storage capacity	of gas refrigerators to make them competitive with electric models.	7.32496540144219
3279. much interest has also been expressed in new techniques for processing	the urethane foams including spraying frothing and molding	.	5.923638875817327
3280. and in meeting the demands for urethane	foam as a garment interlining new adhesives and new methods of laminating	foam to a substrate have been developed.	7.525738943187172
3281. new techniques	for automatic molding of expandable styrene beads have helped boost	that particular material into a number of new consumer applications including	picnic chests beverage coolers flower pots and flotation-type	swimming toys.	5.309829195605387
3282. two other end-use areas which contributed to expandable	styrene's growth during the year were packaging	and foamed-core building panels.	8.984778455137109
3283. extruded expandable styrene film or sheet- claimed to be competitive	price-wise with paper- also showed much potential particularly	for packaging.	5.385438797509822
3284. sandwich panels for building utility shelters that	consist of kraft paper skins and rigid styrene foam cores also aroused	interest in the construction field.	6.45017848021491
3285. in vinyl foam the big news	was the development of techniques for coating fabrics with the material	.	7.852229804556866
3286. better hand a more luxurious	feel and better insulating properties were claimed to be the result.	8.585782221724756
3287. several companies also saw possibilities in using the technique for	extruding or molding vinyl products with a slight cellular core that	would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end	product to any great extent.	5.013150524332601
3288. readers interested in additional	information on foams are referred to the foamed plastics chart appearing	in the technical data section and to the list of references which	appears below.	8.220763843648731
3289. since the mid 1950s when	urethane foam first made its appearance in the american market growth	has been little short of fantastic.	6.7691658041170095
3290. present estimates are that production	topped the 100-million-lb mark in 1960	; by 1965 production	may range from 200 to 350 million lb for flexible and from 115	to 150 million lb for rigid.	5.887531629745734
3291. the markets that have started to open	up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations.	7.053103960926812
3292. furniture upholstery as just one example can easily take millions	of pounds; foamed refrigerator insulation is under intensive evaluation	by every major manufacturer; and use of the foam for garment	interlining is only now getting off the ground with volume potential	in the offing.	6.455932355510766
3293. urethane foams are basically	reaction products of hydroxyl-rich materials and polyisocyanates	.	6.210871206873012
3294. blowing can be either one of two types-	carbon dioxide gas generated by the reaction of water on the polyisocyanate	or mechanical blowing through the use of a low-boiling liquid	such as a fluorinated hydrocarbon.	7.439604548528602
3295. the most important factor	in determining what properties the end-product will have is quite naturally	the type of hydroxyl-rich compound that is used in its production.	6.490318775158334
3296. originally the main types used were various compositions of polyesters.	7.879513779734377
3297. these are still in wide use today particularly in semi-rigid	formulations for such applications as cores for sandwich-type structural	panels foamed-in-place insulation automotive safety padding arm	rests etc.	5.355513216681253
3298. more recently polyethers- again in varied compositions	molecular weights and branching- have come into use at first	for the flexible foams just lately for the rigids.	7.097388920346894
3299. the polyether glycols	are claimed to give flexible urethanes a spring-back action which	is much desired in cushioning.	6.040227447879625
3300. although the first polyether foams	on the market had to be produced by the two-step prepolymer method	today thanks to new catalysts they can be produced by a one-shot	technique.	7.6682722512463695
3301. it is possible that the polyether foams may soon be molded	on a production basis in low-cost molds with more intricate contours	and with superior properties to latex foam.	7.484037565070679
3302. the polyester urethane	foam is generally produced with adipic acid polyesters; the polyether	group generally consists of foams produced with polypropylene glycol	one shot vs	prepolymer the isocyanate and resin are	mixed anhydrously and no foaming occurs.	6.179445157832027
3303. the foaming can be accomplished	at some future time at a different location by the addition of the	correct proportion of catalyst in solution.	5.974328120188307
3304. in one-shot the isocyanate	polyester or polyether resin catalyst and other additives are	mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately.	7.627671452943762
3305. basically this means	that simpler processing equipment	and less external heat	are required in one-shot foaming although	at the same time the problems of controlling the conditions of	one-shot foaming are critical ones.	5.663860842704784
3306. most commercial	uses of urethane foams require densities between 2 and 30 lbcu	ft for rigid foams between 1 and 3 lbcu ft for flexible	foams.	6.742514284582904
3307. this latter figure compares with latex foam rubber at an average	of 5.	7.240935833372005
3308. 5 lbcu ft in commercial grades.	14.307736303917144
3309. graph in fig 1 p 392 indicates how the ratio of	compressive strength to density varies as the latter is increased or	decreased.	5.354120926558409
3310. the single curve line represents a specific formulation in	a test example.	10.610389404430002
3311. by varying the formula this curve may be moved forward	or backward along the coordinates to produce any desired compression	strengthdensity ratio.	5.449382304158965
3312. in flexible urethane foams we are referring to the range	between the highest and lowest temperatures under which the materials'	primary performance remains functionally useful.	7.1045938508144015
3313. in temperature	resistance this quality is usually related to specific properties	eg flexural tensile strengths etc.	6.869006664561913
3314. thermal conductivity is	directly traceable to the material's porous air-cell construction	which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which	forms its composition.	6.046219493410928
3315. these air or gas bubbles make highly functional	thermal barriers.	7.374827443110157
3316. the k factor a term used to denote the rate	of heat transmission through a material	ranges from 0.	7.48837548295765
3317. 28	for flexible urethane foams and from 0.	7.14162538120728
3318. 16 for rigid urethane	foams depending upon the formulation density cell size and nature	of blowing agents used.	7.051090252770527
3319. table 1 p 394 shows a comparison of	k factor ratings of a number of commercial insulating materials	flexural	this term refers to the ability of a material	to resist bending stress and is determined by measuring the load required	to cause failure by bending.	5.171087020184271
3320. the higher-density urethane semi-rigid	foams usually have stronger flex fatigue resistance ie the	12 lbcu ft foam has 8 times the flexural strength of the	3 lbcu ft density.	6.520969347794568
3321. note that flexural strength is not always	improved by simply increasing the density nor is the change always	proportional from one formulation to another.	5.58385264866827
3322. where flexural strength	is an important factor be sure that your urethane foam processor is	aware of it.	8.589322475425199
3323. this property refers to the greatest	longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tearing	apart.	6.978827002504195
3324. like compression strength of urethane foams it has a direct	relationship to formulation.	9.249715969044932
3325. exceptional tensile strength is another	of urethane foam's strong features.	6.460370037324521
3326. figure 2 above shows the	aging properties of urethane foams as determined by the percent of change	processing	there are many ways of producing a foamed urethane	product.	6.924139435025499
3327. the foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape it	can be molded it can be poured-in-place it can be applied by spray	guns etc.	7.0520547354915
3328. slab stock is still one of the most important forms	of urethane end-product in use today.	9.214312472973445
3329. basically the foam machines	that produce such stock consist of two or more pumping units a variable	mixer a nozzle carriage assembly and in many cases a conveyor	belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process	and until it solidifies into foam.	4.836742672395702
3330. the ingredients are fed from tanks	through a hose and into the mixer at a predetermined rate.	8.01155127112603
3331. the mixing	head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the receptacle.	7.022129115845684
3332. it only takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed	and after a short cure the material can be cut into lengths as desired.	9.446203023405877
3333. much has been done in the way of ingenious slitters to fabricate	the slab stock into finished products.	10.575321215900773
3334. profile cutting machines	are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce	sine triangle trapezoid and other profiles in variable heights	dimensions etc.	6.157942065974489
3335. the convoluted sheets can be combined to attain	certain cushioning effects mechanically rather than chemically.	6.714724581145861
3336. also	available is a slitter which peels the inside of a folded block	of foam and can be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 yd in	length down to 116 in thick.	7.731807563733047
3337. the low cost and ease of fabrication	of the dies for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide	variety of shapes dimensions and contours that can be tailor-made to	customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case	liners materials handling containers packaging and cushioning devices	and such novelties as soap dishes toys head rests arch supports	and gas pedal covers.	4.659062406980548
3338. although slab stock appeared	first it soon became apparent that for the production of cushions with	irregular shapes crowned contours or rounded edges the cutting of	slab stock is a wasteful and uneconomical process.	7.415995619325177
3339. only by resorting	to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily	in the established cushion market.	5.882665434718879
3340. the closed molding	of flexible urethane foams has been a problem ever since the introduction	of the material.	9.092991655875728
3341. satisfactory methods for polyester foams and even prepolymer polyether	foams were never fully achieved.	5.674295354649883
3342. closed molding generally resulted	in parts weighing more than parts fabricated	from free-blown foams.	7.391013650626644
3343. this counteracted the gain from having no scrap	loss.	8.566230593895058
3344. in addition there were difficulties with the flow and spreading	of the foam mixture over the mold surface trouble with lack of	gel strength in the rising foam and problems of splits.	7.692723202922561
3345. the introduction	of one-shot polyether foam systems aided by the development of	new catalysts helped to alleviate some of the problems of closed molding.	6.894536374148562
3346. while there are still many bugs to be ironed out the technique	is fast developing.	7.6975600878509125
3347. simple systems are available	that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured pumped	etc into a void where they foam up to fill the void.	5.303716636048607
3348. in a	typical application- the making of rigid urethane foam sandwich panels-	an amount of foam mixture calculated to expand 10 to 20% more	than the volume of the panel is poured into the panel void and the top	of the panel is locked in place by a jig.	7.7378734610729065
3349. temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85-90`f	.	6.002446559592496
3350. the top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs.	12.601182857101412
3351. sixty	lbs loading is possible but 40 lbs is adequate.	6.460370037324521
3352. the suds	box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain	pipe and the machine is started.	7.885353697184124
3353. the 160-ml bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is	applied slowly and directly to the running specimen.	6.4740661036925005
3354. washing is continued	for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips	or passes through the squeeze rolls.	8.487882770863258
3355. at the conclusion of the washing	8 liters of water at 90`f are automatically metered	from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs 4 liters to each tub.	6.378180457996978
3356. this operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes.	11.750463804107763
3357. during the rinsing	operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow	from the main drain begins.	7.408794115284575
3358. at this point the drains are readjusted so	that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line	and the main tub drain is set at the 2-12 mark on the drain gauge.	7.33779820552428
3359. when	all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the	main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs.	4.949927667637509
3360. the	run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line.	8.642994674678409
3361. by this procedure rinsing progresses in two stages first	by dilution until the time when the drains are separated and thereafter	by displacement of the soil-bearing liquor by clean rinse water since	soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the nip passes directly	to waste from the suds box drains.	5.1156691275363455
3362. this method of rinsing appears	to produce maximum cleansing with minimum soil redeposition.	9.799021184397427
3363. evaluation and classification	evaluation may be made on	either a soil-removal or a grease-removal basis as desired.	5.734108506263463
3364. a	reflectance-measuring	instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning whereas	soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal.	7.779119985264115
3365. this test method is intended for determining	the dimensional changes of woven or knitted fabrics made of fibers other	than wool to be expected when the cloth is subjected to laundering	procedures commonly used in the commercial laundry and the home.	5.4765050568064275
3366. four	washing test procedures are established varying in severity from very	severe to very mild and are intended to cover the range of practical	washing from commercial procedure to hand washing.	6.598565700936248
3367. five drying test	procedures are established to cover the range of drying techniques	used in the home and commercial laundry.	7.632363747279384
3368. three methods for determining	the dimensional restorability characteristics are established for those	textiles which require restoration by ironing or wearing after laundering.	6.7459188857164945
3369. these tests are not accelerated and must be repeated to evaluate	dimensional changes after repeated launderings.	6.508858350093015
3370. table 1	summarizes all of the various washing drying and restoration procedures	available.	9.457765873464483
3371. the person using these tests must determine which combination	of procedures is practical for any specific item in order to	evaluate the dimensional changes of textile fabrics or garments after	laundering procedures commonly used in the home or commercial laundry.	5.541039049574238
3372. it is possible to identify the test procedure completely with a code	consisting of a roman numeral a letter and an arabic number.	10.878770592246754
3373. for	example test 3 e 1 refers to a specimen which has been washed	by procedure 3	in the machine has been dried in a tumble dryer by procedure e	and has been subjected to restorative forces on the tension	presser by procedure 1.	4.852867660438463

3399. the	tensioning members have a common drive so that the application of restorative	force takes place simultaneously in all directions in the plane	of the test specimen.	0.0
3400. the minimum diameter of the pin frame in the	collapsed state is 11 inches and the maximum diameter in the freely	extended state is 14 inches.	7.863355666854044
3401. the surface of the apparatus	in contact with the test specimen is uncluttered and polished so as	to be as friction-free as possible.	7.136906511611992
3402. the preparation	of test specimens will vary depending upon the type of dimensional	restorability procedure to be used.	8.752712258244562
3403. three specimens	for each sample to be tested are required in order to arrive at a satisfactory	average of performance.	6.973414821987224
3404. this is especially true for knitted	fabrics.	22.77399658082145
3405. specimens are allowed to reach moisture equilibrium with	a standard atmosphere of f and f and then laid out without tension	on a flat polished surface care being taken that the fabric is	free from wrinkles or creases.	4.849839529851557
3406. fabrics that are badly distorted in their	unlaundered state due to faulty finishing may give deceptive dimensional	change results when laundered by any procedure.	6.221143152558621
3407. this also holds	true	if restorative forces are applied.	9.50578119814466
3408. therefore it is recommended that	in such cases the sample be replaced or if used the results of dimensional	change or dimensional restorability tests be considered as indicative	only.	7.382270212735005
3409. generally it is necessary to mark distances on	a specimen in both lengthwise and widthwise directions and	to measure before and after laundering.	6.469890945019252
3410. the distances may be marked	with indelible ink and a fine-point pen by sewing fine threads into	the fabric or by a specially designed stamping machine.	6.869018355378539
3411. the marked distances	are parallel to the respective yarns.	9.805462288949576

3414. the distances are at	woven or warp knitted	each specimen is at least 25 inches by 25 inches.	8.577512421946116
3415. place the template	on the fabric so that the sides of the 10 inch square	cut out of the template are parallel to the warp and filling for woven	fabrics or the wales and courses for knitted fabrics and so that the	same amount of fabric extends beyond the edges of the template on all	sides.	5.8570705437772395
3416. mark the specimen at the outer edges of the template with pen	and indelible ink; also place three dots on the specimen at each	side of the 10 inch square one dot at midpoint and one at approximately	circular knitted	fabrics to be subjected to restorative procedure 2	each specimen is approximately 16 inches square.	5.89717433950293
3417. the markings	consist of a centrally located 10 inch diameter measuring circle	and a 14 inch diameter circle of 20 dots equidistantly spaced	.	5.482775642821309
3418. critical measurements in length and width	directions should be taken before and after washing drying and restorative	procedures.	7.831599672669457

3426. refill the machine	to a level of f inches with water at 100-109` f	and start the machine.	6.757567981697296
3427. inject steam if necessary to reach the	temperature shown in column d of table 2.	5.8443098669395415
3428. again stop the machine	at the end of the time shown in column c of table 2.	11.511383051735498
3429. this procedure is repeated for the second rinse using the temperatures	tests	2 3	- run the machine continuously until completion	of the test.	6.709412491609848
3430. drain off the soap solution of the suds cycle at such	a time that the wheel has become substantially empty of soap and water	at the end of the time shown in column a of table 2 measured	from the time the wash wheel was started.	7.2962594691203675
3431. refill the machine to a	level of f inches with water at 100-109` f.	5.674295354649883
3432. when this water level has been reached inject steam until the temperature	is that shown in column d.	8.498257340125052
3433. drain off the water at such a time	that the wheel has become substantially empty of water at the end	of the sum of the times shown in columns a and c measured from	the time the wash wheel was started.	5.561868169637792
3434. immediately refill to a level	of f inches with water at 100-109` f.	7.983314220386281
3435. when	this water level has been reached inject steam until the temperature is	that shown in column f.	5.326519577128725
3436. drain off the water at such a time that	the wheel has become substantially empty of water at the end of the	sum of the times shown in columns a c and e measured from	the time the wash wheel was started.	7.309877361104346
3437. high-gain photoelectronic image intensification is applied under	conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time	required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of	practicability.	4.726707772215755
3438. examples of such situations are night reconnaissance	the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues	special radiography in medical or industrial applications track recording	of high energy particles etc.	5.950565555073685
3439. high-gain photoelectronic	image intensification may be achieved by several methods; some of	cascading single stages by coupling	lens systems	image intensifier based upon the multipactor	transmission secondary electron multiplication	cascading of single	stages enclosed in one common envelope.	4.739044053628577
3440. cascading single stages	by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems	limit the obtainable gain quite severely.	6.54093796655646
3441. channel-type image intensifiers	are capable of achieving high-gain values; suffer however	from an inherently low resolution.	5.542917982132687
3442. image intensifiers based upon	the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable	resolution is concerned.	7.6307812752833115
3443. however the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts	the effective gain.	9.61481127931075
3444. tsem tubes have been constructed showing	high gain and resolution.	8.196044167676531
3445. however electrostatic focus important	for many applications has not been realized for these devices.	7.16818143971783
3446. resolution	limitations with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to	chromatic aberrations.	7.879513779734377
3447. furthermore the thin film dynodes appear to	have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support cannot be	tolerated.	5.4560684206020245
3448. cascaded single stages enclosed by a common envelope	have been constructed with high gain and high resolution.	6.937006599308215
3449. these	tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system	and in the design of the coupling members.	7.295654372297002
3450. the electron optical system	may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one.	9.005093323721033
3451. the magnification	may be smaller equal or larger than unity.	7.839212140222358
3452. an electrostatic	system suffers generally from image plane curvature leading to defocusing	in the peripheral image region if a flat viewing screen	is utilized while a magnetic system requires accurate	adjustment of the solenoid which is heavy and bulky.	5.912385811192862
3453. as it will be discussed	later peripheral defocusing can be improved on by utilizing	curved fiber couplers.	9.652050886117552
3454. it should be noted however that the paraxial	resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems.	13.74097820887864
3455. it is felt that fiber-coupled double- stage image intensifiers	will gain considerable importance in the future.	8.588330474143397
3456. therefore we	shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities	of such tubes.	7.452593427909857
3457. the luminous efficiency and resolution of single	stages fiber couplers and finally of the composite tube will be	computed.	5.902564164932943
3458. it will be shown theoretically that the high image	intensification obtainable with such a tube and contact photography permits	the utilization of extremely low incident light levels.	9.033772965766241
3459. the effect	of device and quantum noise associated with such low input levels	will be described.	6.374057384651866
3460. after these theoretical considerations constructional	details of a fiber-coupled double-stage x-ray image	intensifier will be discussed.	8.269770199313292
3461. measured performance characteristics	for this experimental tube will be listed.	6.460370037324521
3462. the conclusion shall	be reached that fiber-coupled double-stage tubes represent a sensible	and practical approach to high-gain image intensification.	7.48837548295765
3463. design of a fiber-coupled double-stage image intensifier	the tube	design which forms the basis of the theoretical discussion shall	be described now.	6.481289888466684
3464. the electron optical system is	based in principle on the focusing action of concentric spherical cathode	and anode surfaces.	7.48837548295765
3465. the inner anode sphere is pierced elongated	into a cup and terminated by the phosphor screen.	6.524379740209355
3466. the photoelectrons	emitted from a circular segment of the cathode sphere are focused	by the positive lens action of the two concentric spheres pass through	the negative lens formed by the anode aperture and impinge	upon the cathodoluminescent viewing screen.	6.547382963407157
3467. the cylindrical focusing	electrode permits adjustment of the positive lens part by varying the	focusing potential.	6.739060053300051
3468. the anode potential codetermines the gain g	and magnification m of the stage.	8.649006242526841
3469. both the photocathode	and the image plane of such an electrode configuration are curved	concave as seen from the anode aperture.	6.2445428624632004
3470. the field-flattening property	of the biconcave fiber coupler can be utilized to alleviate the	peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat phosphor-screen or	coupling member.	6.852952259467768
3471. for the same reason the output fiber plate is planoconcave	its exposed flat side permitting contact photography if a permanent	record is desired.	6.78311755230371
3472. as it will be shown later the field-flattening	properties of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed	the main advantage of such a design.	9.807698803203976
3473. the second photocathode	and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate substrates.	7.189870893850623
3474. the photocathode sensitivities s phosphor efficiencies	p and anode potentials v of the individual stages shall	be distinguished by means of subscripts 1 and 2 in the text	where required.	7.423433299685585
3475. both stages are assumed to have unity magnification.	7.706612280004475
3476. _flux gain of a single	stage	to a first approximation given by the product of the photocathode	sensitivity s	and the phosphor conversion efficiency p.	8.003084001705767
3477. in	general p is a function of v and the current density	but it shall here be assumed as a constant.	5.371471655048383
3478. the luminous	efficiency f of a photocathode depends on the maximum radiant	sensitivity f and on the spectral distribution of the incident light	f by the relation: f where f h normalized radiant photocathode	sensitivity.	7.374412916872955
3479. f h standard visibility function.	9.353934385141944
3480. the luminous flux	gain of a single stage is given by: f if the input light distribution	falls beyond the visible range f as expected since f.	6.593952525060604
3481. such	cases are not considered here.	8.254441635698543
3482. the numerical aperture of the fibers	is given by: f where f.	9.005093323721033
3483. the angle f is measured in	the medium of index f.	7.43304005989246
3484. settled phosphors as generally used in image	intensifiers have low optical contact with the substrate surface	hence f shall be assumed.	6.9981782873391465
3485. the numerical aperture should be in general	close to unity.	9.637954789653998
3486. this condition can be satisfied eg with f	and f or equivalent glass combinations.	9.227439327932043
3487. a sufficiently good	approximation for determining the end reflection losses r	can be	obtained from the angle independent fresnel formula: f for phosphor	to fiber and fiber to air surfaces and assuming f we obtain	f percent.	4.766823111010703
3488. this value may be reduced to 4.	14.52766129482798
3489. 6 percent by means of a	glass layer of index 1.	7.43944464357368
3490. hence the f factor for the output	fiber coupler is f.	10.378179976681373
3491. as the index of refraction of photosensitive	surfaces of the sbcs-type lies around 2 the fresnel losses	at the fiber-photocathode interface are about 0.	6.190414547562976
3492. 5 percent and the	f factor for the interstage coupler is 0.	9.887640129373123
3493. it might be anticipated	that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further.	10.016238941738651
3494. the internal losses are due to absorption and the small but	finite losses suffered in the numerous internal reflections due to	deviations from the prescribed cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute	imperfections of the core-jacket interface.	6.179445157832027
3495. these losses depend	on fiber diameter and length absorption coefficient the mean value of	the loss per internal reflection and last but not least on the angular	distribution of the incident light.	5.43822978976424
3496. explicit expressions	are given in the literature.	12.019878112011932
3497. lacking reliable data for some	of the variables we are relying on experimental data of about 20 percent	internal losses for 14-inch long small diameter	fibers.	5.111000576664747
3498. this relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber	diameters increasing the number of internal reflections.	9.166756980583028
3499. since we are	considering here relatively small diameter fiber plates	their average thickness can be kept below 14 inch and their internal	losses may be assumed as 15 percent.	5.439412535771187
3500. the packing	efficiency fr of fiber plates did not receive much attention	in the literature probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally	used until rather recently.	7.8869241986042775
3501. for circular fibers in a closely	packed hexagonal array the packing efficiency is given by: f where	f and 0.	5.929729974125496
3502. 906 is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the	circumscribed hexagon.	10.031504418840386
3503. for the small diameter fibers now technically	feasible and required for about 100 f resolution f.	7.155032443137332
3504. the cladding	thickness is about 0.	13.848082117783294
3505. 5|m hence f and f.	8.254441635698543
3506. thus	the efficiency |t couplers is given by- f or approximately	50 percent each.	7.391013650626644
3507. it must be remembered that the fiber plates replace	a glass window and a membrane in addition to an optical	output lens system.	8.192759518930824
3508. the efficiency f of an f lens at the magnification	f is: f neglecting absorption the end losses of the coupling	membrane and the output window f would be 6 percent and 8 percent.	6.226273678698645
3509. thus the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two	fiber plates is 0.	7.344826497149266
3510. 043 or about	gain of fiber	including the brightness gain f due	to the f area demagnification the overall gain of a fiber coupled double	stage image intensifier is: f it is obvious that the careful	choice of photocathode which maximizes f for a given input e	is very important.	6.205372672477747
3511. the same consideration should govern the choice	of the second-stage phosphor screen for matching with the spectral	sensitivity of the ultimate sensor.	6.127181057961793
3512. we have evaluated the matching integrals for two types	of photocathodes and three types of light input.	9.086762498902816
3513. the input light distributions considered are p-11 and p-20	phosphor emission and the so-called night light	as given by hw babcock and j j johnson.	5.327707589329553
3514. the integrals	are listed in table 14-1 below:	discussion of paraxial device resolution	_resolution limitations	the resolution limitations for a single stage are	given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as	well as the resolution capabilities of the cathodoluminescent viewing	screen.	6.208221715819111
3515. the resolution capabilities of an electrostatic system	depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberrations.	7.374669555731543
3516. it has been stated previously that a minifying electrostatic system yields	a lower resolution than a magnifying system or a system with unity	magnification.	9.084762115428768
3517. furthermore the chromatic aberrations depend	on the chosen high voltage.	6.903819216005966
3518. in general a high anode voltage reduces	chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution.	9.480380115267906
3519. the luminous gain of the discussed tube was calculated from eq	for the 16 possible combinations of s-11 and s-20 photocathodes	and p-11 and p-20 phosphor screens for night light	and p-20 light input.	4.908401855518352
3520. it corresponds roughly to the light emission of conventional x-ray	.	11.536380215083017
3521. the following efficiencies obtained from jedec	and rca specifications were used: f   the following	table gain values computed according	to eq with f:   the possibility of a space charge	blowup of the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundles has	been pointed out.	5.202480459306776
3522. it is obvious that such an influence can only be	expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output	levels.	9.94436696991894
3523. space charge influences will also decrease at increased	voltages.	6.987307572036626
3524. electrostatic systems of the pseudo-symmetric type have	been tested for resolution capabilities by applying electronography.	7.032105024464237
3525. a resolution of 70-80 line-pairs per millimeter appears to be feasible.	7.870513614425933
3526. the inherent resolution of a cathodoluminescent phosphor	screen decreases with increasingly aggregate thickness	decreases with decreasing porosity	and might be impaired by the	normally used aluminum mirror.	6.759075170978014
3527. thus in general elementary light	optical effects light scatter and electron scatter determine the obtainable	resolution limit.	7.123801189811166
3528. it should be noted that photoluminescence	due to bremsstrahlung generated within the viewing screen by electron	impact appears to be important only if anode voltages in excess	of 30 kv are utilized.	10.171388639244205
3529. it has been stated that settled cathodoluminescent	phosphor screens may have a limiting resolution of 60 f	at high voltage values of approximately 20 kv.	7.434736587010844
3530. for the further discussion	we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of 80 f	and phosphor screen resolution of 60 f.	7.92189051246282
3531. the set of all decisions is called the operating policy or more simply	the policy.	6.70442043428815
3532. an optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the	best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product.	10.049476075112374
3533. there are thus three components to an optimal design problem:	the specification of the operating variables and the transformation	the specification of the objective function	of which the optimization is desired.	6.010613279095055
3534. for a chemical process	the	first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical	species and the temperature or pressure of the stream.	8.21051322268281
3535. for the	second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling	to be supplied; the way in which the transformation of state depends	on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed	in the next chapter.	5.949045901713329
3536. the objective function is some measure of	the increase in value of the stream by processing; it is the subject	of chapter 4.	8.356493960437957
3537. the essential characteristic of an optimal policy	when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages	with no feedback was first isolated by bellman.	5.944922442780418
3538. he recognized that	whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an r-stage	process the remaining stages must use an optimal f-stage policy	with respect to the state resulting from the first stage if there	is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process.	7.713262285813877
3539. moreover by	systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and	always using the optimal f-stage policy for the remaining stages	we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all r stages.	5.329540144897029
3540. proceeding	in this way from one to two and from two to three stages we	may gradually build up the policy for any number.	7.766318240882622
3541. at each step of the	calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied.	7.595030694353987
3542. to see how important this economy is let us suppose that there	are m operating variables at each stage and that the state	is specified by n variables; then the search for the maximum	at any one stage will require a number of operations of order f	.	7.2701772592996265
3543. to proceed from	one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated	to allow of interpolation; this number will be of the order	of f.	5.932038371272668
3544. if however we are seeking the optimal r-stage policy	for a given feed state only one search for a maximum is required at	the final step.	7.3943616279429145
3545. thus a number of operations of the order of f are	required.	12.207232173175122
3546. if all the operating variables were varied simultaneously	f operations would be required to do the same job and as r	increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations	required by the dynamic program.	7.671099215086915
3547. but even more important than	this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all	operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy namely that	for the given feed state and r stages.	6.478356009977129
3548. in contrast the dynamic	program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for	any smaller number of stages.	8.328456479183021
3549. if the problem is enlarged to require	a complete coverage of feed states f operations are needed by the dynamic	program and f by the direct search.	6.252870165152844
3550. but f is vastly larger	than r.	14.306364280244424
3551. no optimism is more baseless than that which believes	that the high speed of modern digital computers allows for use of the	crudest of methods in searching out a result.	5.147795169008453
3552. suppose that f and	that the average operation requires only f sec.	8.587029108688856
3553. then the dynamic	program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would	take	more than three millennia!   the principle of optimality thus	brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of	a multistage decision process.	5.438494564100928
3554. bellman has annunciated in the	following terms:   an optimal policy has the property that	whatever the initial state and initial decision are the remaining decisions	must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting	from the first decision.	6.433520450586074
3555. this is the principle which	we will invoke in every case to set up a functional equation.	10.930775730979924
3556. it appears	in a form that is admirably suited to the powers of the digital	computer.	11.693712841932427
3557. at the same time every device that can be employed to reduce	the number of variables is of the greatest value and it is one of	the attractive features of dynamic programming that room is left for	ingenuity in using the special features of the problem to this end.	7.551369506463521
3558. the discrete deterministic process	consider the process illustrated	in fig 2.	9.945332631078985
3559. 1 consisting of r distinct stages.	10.162698742101748
3560. these	will be numbered in the direction opposite to the flow of the process	stream so that stage r is the rth stage from the end.	6.7301008326787635
3561. let the state of the stream leaving stage r be denoted by a vector	f and the operating variables of stage r by f.	6.805341775456598
3562. thus	f denotes the state of the feed to the r-stage process and	f the state of the product from the last stage.	9.820335087733522
3563. each stage transforms	the state f of its feed to the state f in a way that depends on	the operating variables f.	6.891016206689562
3564. this transformation	is uniquely determined by f and we therefore speak of the process	as deterministic.	9.273238270682372
3565. in practical situations there will be restrictions	on the admissible operating conditions and we regard the vectors as belonging	to a fixed and bounded set s.	5.994528108156906
3566. the set of vectors f	constitutes the operating policy or more briefly the policy and a	policy is admissible if all the f belong to s.	7.121574595755137
3567. when the policy	has been chosen the state of the product can be obtained from the	state of the feed by repeated application of the transformation;	thus f.	8.23494310113226
3568. the objective function which is to be maximized is some	function usually piecewise continuous of the product state.	9.647144077243745
3569. let this	be denoted by f.	11.98058228218936
3570. an optimal policy is an admissible policy	f which maximizes the objective function p.	7.908664602512112
3571. the policy may	not be unique but the maximum value of p certainly is and once	the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by	as a function of the feed state f.	5.1617518647114595
3572. let f where the maximization	is over all admissible policies f.	10.011690633046488
3573. when it is necessary to be specific	we say that the optimal policy is an optimal r-stage policy	with respect to the feed state f.	8.472918560529706
3574. for any choice of admissible	policy f in the first stage the state of the stream leaving	this stage is given by f.	9.278321030873448
3575. this is the feed state of the subsequent	f stages which according to the principle of optimality must use an	optimal f-stage policy with respect to this state.	9.075230255308774
3576. this will result	in a value f of the objective function and when f is chosen correctly	this will give f the maximum of the objective function.	7.147464881877732
3577. thus	f	where the maximization is over all admissible policies f and f	is related to f by can be solved	for f when f is known and clearly f the maximization being	over all admissible f.	4.5421746389230675
3578. the set of equations and the	starting equation is of a recursive type well suited to programming	on the digital computer.	7.762609397140794
3579. in finding the optimal r-stage policy	from that of f stages only the function f is needed.	6.460757856108023
3580. when	f has been found it may be transferred into the storage location of	f and the whole calculation repeated.	8.246514118375284
3581. we also see how the results	may be presented although if n the number of state variables	is large any tabulation will become cumbersome.	6.3822034550297495
3582. a table or set of tables	may be set out as in table 2.	8.55371701457874
3583. to extract the optimal	r-stage policy with respect to the feed state f we enter section	r of this table at the state f and find immediately	from the last column the maximum value of the objective function.	5.703633493391938
3584. in	the third column is given the optimal policy for stage r and	in the fourth the resulting state of the stream when this policy is used.	6.728997285543211
3585. since by the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an	optimal f-stage policy with respect to f we may enter section f	of the table at this state f and read off the optimal policy for stage	f and the resulting state f.	5.118833452401329
3586. proceeding in this way up the table	we extract the complete optimal policy and if it is desired we	can check on f by evaluating f at the last stage.	8.202941771014192
3587. it may be	that the objective function depends not only on f but also on f	as when the cost of the operating policy is considered.	7.706774027418336
3588. a moment's	reflection shows that the above algorithm and presentation work equally	well in this case.	7.88014969880378
3589. a form of objective function that we shall often	have occasion to consider is f.	7.17950040656453
3590. here v represents	the	the cost	of operating the stage with conditions .	11.259636964467346
3591. hence p	is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation that	is the net profit.	7.503951698706899
3592. if f denotes the net profit from stage r	and f then the principle of optimality gives f this sequence	of equations may be started with the remark that with no process f there	is no profit ie f.	6.800750486020274
3593. the process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only	statistically is also of interest although for chemical reactor design	it is not as important as the deterministic process.	7.6079195329582205
3594. in this case	the stage r operating with conditions f transforms the state	of the stream from f to f but only the probability distribution of	f is known.	7.360130383667018
3595. this is specified by a distribution function f such	that the probability that f lies in some region d of the stage	space is f.	6.268968593365866
3596. we cannot now speak of maximizing the value	of the objective function since this function is now known only in a	probabilistic sense.	8.058402443511438
3597. we can however maximize its expected value.	11.933630927614972
3598. for	a single stage we may define f where the maximization is by choice	of f.	7.032105024464237
3599. we thus have an optimal policy which maximizes the expected	value of the objective function for a given f.	6.484698453818843
3600. if we consider a process	in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the	next then the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent	stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first.	8.148566495101765
3601. then f the maximization being over all admissible f and the integration	over the whole of stage space.	6.3733921415345565
3602. the type of presentation	of results used in the deterministic process may be used here except	that now the fourth column is redundant.	8.96042901832664
3603. the third column gives	the optimal policy but we must wait to see the outcome of stage r	and enter the preceding section of the table at this state.	7.1514735154402835
3604. the	discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not	known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter.	7.158709062449044
3605. in many cases it is not	possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages	since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner	through the process.	6.300916785450441
3606. we replace r the number of the stage	from the end of the process by t a continuous variable which	measures the distance of the point considered from the end of the	process.	11.140874931348808
3607. the word distance is used here in a rather general sense;	it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the	process.	6.868674993622193
3608. if t is the total length of the process its	feed state may be denoted by a vector  and the product	state by  denotes the state at	any point t and  the vector of operating variables	there.	7.767817575731528
3609. a gyro-stabilized platform system using restrained gyros is	well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the	gyro-platform-servo combination.	6.1002718645445935
3610. the restrained gyro-stabilized platform	with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate	equation of motion neglecting transient effects as follows:	f where u is a torque applied about the output axis of the	controlling gyro.	6.227116739151118
3611. the platform angle |f is the angle about	which the gyro is controlling.	6.817408452020724
3612. this is normally termed the gyro input	axis 90` away from the gyro output or |j axis.	10.454030701015315
3613. the gyro angular	momentum is defined by h.	8.976097203071156
3614. thus if the gyro and platform-controller	combination maintains the platform with zero angular	deviation about the |f axis the system can be rotated with an	angular velocity f if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis |j.	6.270627766869903
3615. it is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers	so that a torque can be applied about their output axes.	8.230943349647005
3616. in the system shown in fig 7-1 the accelerometer output is amplified	and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro output-axis torquer.	9.886217260266333
3617. this torque causes the entire system to rotate about the |f	axis since the response to f.	6.137472201451243
3618. if the polarities are correct the	platform rotates in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output	to zero.	9.59721944103896
3619. as the accelerometer output is decreasing the torque applied	to the gyro output axis decreases and therefore the rate decreases.	6.4704405399531035
3620. finally when the accelerometer output is zero the entire system	remains stationary and the platform is by definition leveled.	7.288900799735519
3621. a mathematical block diagram for the leveling system is shown in	fig 7-2.	6.869739491308488
3622. the platform is initially off level by the angle |f.	9.430036403335416
3623. the angle generated by the platform servo |f multiplied by g	is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer.	5.780140237098333
3624. f	is the scale factor of the accelerometer.	9.924684914768017
3625. the voltage f is amplified	by f and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor f.	7.005525266517035
3626. finally the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented	by f the system as indicated in fig 7-2 is fundamental and simple	because the transient effects of both the platform servo and the	accelerometer have been neglected.	6.381145722783109
3627. with these factors included an upper	limit is placed on the allowable loop gain by stability considerations.	7.680799626726051
3628. in this type of system a high loop gain is desirable because it	provides a fast response time.	9.702836094942622
3629. when the frequency response characteristics	of practical components are considered their effect on	stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop	gain.	5.950743172816236
3630. the time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately	inversely proportional to the servo loop gain.	8.395020531259691
3631. in addition	the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is approximately proportional	to the servo loop gain; ie high loop gain causes the	system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations.	5.658150040830737
3632. this problem	usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response	time.	8.823411164925119
3633. it must be noticed in fig 7-1 that the accelerometer	responds to any input acceleration.	8.799215518229115
3634. the equation relating input	acceleration to output platform angle is f in practice the preflight	leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe.	6.673055462121845
3635. when the system is arranged for automatic leveling the platform	angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on	the accelerometers.	6.985033348206907
3636. there are many such components of acceleration present	due to the effect of wind gusts engine noise turbulence around	the vehicle etc.	11.858661917697805
3637. one of the greatest problems associated with automatic	leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of high-level	acceleration noise.	10.838046414385232
3638. one solution to the problem is to operate	with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filters.	11.399959901557546
3639. this technique	causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components	such as the platform tilt.	6.137472201451243
3640. since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering	increases the response time a practical compromise must be reached.	7.590800568668409
3641. one of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the	use of a non-linear amplifier for f.	9.699383048252644
3642. the amplifier is designed so	that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold	level.	7.663024046550707
3643. below this level the amplifier gain f is proportional	and is of small value in order to provide adequate noise filtering.	5.835473001769006
3644. the	effect is that the platform returns from an off-level position at	a rapid rate until it is nearly level at which point the platform is	controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response	so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process.	6.240225426721251
3645. when	the system is on automatic leveling the gyro drift is canceled by	the output of the leveling system.	5.4560684206020245
3646. the platform actually	tilts off level so that the accelerometer output when amplified	by f will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel	the gyro drift.	6.941335705905106
3647. the amount of platform dip required depends upon the	scale factors of the system.	9.261350790332987
3648. the automatic leveling system described in this section is readily	adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three integrating	gyros.	7.333060553020843
3649. the system requires some switching of flight equipment circuits.	9.265005517434957
3650. however the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled	remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform.	8.630915665770779
3651. this leveling system will hold the platform on-level automatically	as long as the system is actuated.	7.736817524741486
3652. a useful by-product of this	system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift biases	is available from the currents necessary to hold the system in level.	7.8076921455580495
3653. the leveling process can be accomplished manually and the results	are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment.	6.104044052552417
3654. the	process consists in turning the platform manually until the outputs	of both accelerometers are zero.	7.032105024464237
3655. the turning is accomplished by applying	voltage to the gyro torquers described above.	6.817408452020724
3656. in brief the human	replaces amplifier f in figs 7-1 and 7-2.	10.12904140595632
3657. manual leveling	requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer outputs.	6.978177995769431
3658. if	high accuracy is required in preflight leveling it is usually necessary	to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs	.	7.04470725452639
3659. with integration the effect of a small	acceleration can be seen after a time.	8.77122911693304
3660. however skill is required on the part of an operator to level a	platform to any degree of accuracy.	9.496346167982761
3661. also it requires more time as	compared to the automatic approach.	7.142947673187237
3662. manual leveling is inconvenient	if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged	period of time.	6.757567981697296
3663. the operator must continually supply the correct	amount of turning current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of	gyro drift is canceled.	5.805447254345494
3664. this process is especially difficult since gyro	drifting is typically random.	9.647666702688586
3665. platform	heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the accelerometers	parallel to the desired coordinate system of the navigator.	5.396094141387029
3666. in simpler	terms it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction.	9.668330866206757
3667. for purely inertial navigators two techniques are available	to accomplish the platform heading:  use of external or	surveying equipment to establish proper heading.	5.607450279891365
3668. use of the	characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true	heading the choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy	requirements field conditions and the time available to accomplish	the heading.	7.226079837991202
3669. with the gyro-stabilized platform leveled it can be	headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques.	7.049728973261037
3670. the platform	accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure.	10.282317167785038
3671. before	the accelerometers are mounted on the platform the direction of	their sensitive axis must be accurately determined.	5.593078119805652
3672. a mirror is mounted	on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is perpendicular	to the sensitive axis of the unit.	8.671512010393146
3673. a precision transit	is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north.	12.390238519607813
3674. this	can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques.	9.89655331134606
3675. with the transit set up a mirror on one of the accelerometers	is sighted and the platform is turned until it is aligned.	7.719594709811595
3676. the	sighting procedure includes the use of a fixture for the transit to	project a beam of light which is darkened by crossed hairs on the accelerometer	mirror.	7.045515859671722
3677. when the platform is aligned the reflected image	of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly superimposed upon the original	crossed hairs.	6.85320845533008
3678. the images can easily be aligned with a high degree	of accuracy.	10.93951072137165
3679. the platform is turned as required by supplying currents	to the appropriate gyro torquers.	6.578982329721101
3680. although this technique is	simple and satisfactory one practical difficulty does exist: the direction	of true north must be known for each launch point.	6.928763765787131
3681. however	this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying	team can establish a true north base line with a few days' work.	6.035226674045869
3682. in many installations the inertial platform is raised off the ground	a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight.	8.799743460193586
3683. with this situation it is difficult to sight in on the platform with	surveying equipment.	10.34800060135459
3684. if the platform is not too high off the ground	a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform.	9.508385408971838
3685. obviously the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since	errors are introduced because of motion of the stand.	5.929848169630036
3686. the transit can be replaced by an autocollimator.	12.6078345414341
3687. this instrument	provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations	of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform	on true heading.	7.001786473599458
3688. the electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified	and supplied to the z-gyro torquer.	8.346523409839932
3689. if the polarity is	correct the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero.	7.42571121752819
3690. information is also available from this autocollimator system to set	the drift bias for the z-axis gyro.	7.492188089872309
3691. if the z gyro	is drifting a current generated by the autocollimator is delivered to	the gyro torquer to cancel the drift.	6.430558768088862
3692. if the drift error is systematic	it can be canceled with a bias circuit which can be arranged and adjusted	to supply the required compensating current.	8.04647281362408
3693. it is possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff which	will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction	and the platform.	8.601893869922396
3694. essentially the stator or reference portion of	the pickoff is established with respect to the true heading direction	and the platform is turned either manually or automatically until the	angular electrical pickoff signal is reduced to zero.	6.078010875628972
3695. gyrocompass alignment is an automatic heading system	which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true	heading.	5.236383152695367
3696. for the case of a purely inertial autonavigator consisting of	three restrained gyros a coordinate system is used where the sensitive	axis of the x accelerometer is parallel to the east-west direction	at the base point and the y accelerometer sensitive	axis is parallel to the north-south direction at the base point.	7.556019277143689
3697. the	accelerometers are mounted rigidly on the platform.	7.14162538120728
3698. thus if one accelerometer	is properly aligned the other is also.	10.618531190579676
3699. the input axis of the	appropriate gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometers.	7.936577007527541
3700. figure 7-3 shows a platform system with the gyro	vectors arranged as described above.	7.198778874655976
3701. the platform is leveled and properly	headed so that the x-gyro input axis is parallel to the	east-west direction and the y-gyro input axis is parallel to	the north-south direction.	5.4037986017279
3702. the input axis of the x gyro	when pointing in the east-west direction is always perpendicular to	the spin axis of earth.	7.370444693335603
3703. if the platform is not properly headed the	x-gyro input axis will see a component of the earth's rotation.	5.475848712153735
3704. the sensing of this rotation by the x gyro can be utilized	to direct the platform into proper heading.	7.333060553020843
3705. in fig 7-4	the input axis of the three-axis platform is shown at some point on the	earth.	6.9700368027222614
3706. the point is at a latitude |l and the platform is at	an error in heading east.	8.984197268896464
3707. the earth is spinning at an angular velocity	\q equal to one revolution per 24 hr.	6.196120048044738
3708. when the platform is	level |e is a rotation about the z axis of the platform	f.	9.58976046417637
3709. since the earth is rotating and the unleveled gyro-stabilized platform	is fixed with respect to a reference in space an observer on	the earth will see the platform rotating.	5.968888649141386
3710. scotty did not go back to school.	10.77559583899699
3711. his parents	talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist	at the university hospital- mr mckinley was entitled to a	discount for members of his family- and it was decided it would be	best for him to take the remainder of the term off spend a lot of time	in bed and for the rest do pretty much as he chose- provided of	course he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating.	6.11080627696167
3712. his	teacher and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed	that if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home there was	little danger of his losing a term.	6.400433812792864
3713. scotty accepted the decision	with indifference and did not enter the arguments.	6.35989150912935
3714. he was	discharged from the hospital after a two-day checkup and he and his	parents had what mr mckinley described as a celebration lunch	at the cafeteria on the campus.	7.000954838506869
3715. rachel wore a smart hat and because	she had been warned recently about smoking puffed at her cigarettes	through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick.	4.808070905031883
3716. scotty's father	sat sprawled in his chair angular alert as a cricket looking about	at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression	of proprietorship.	6.597577245764726
3717. teachers- men who wore brown suits and	had gray hair and pleasant smiles- came to their table to talk shop	and to be introduced to scotty and rachel.	4.790798589308555
3718. rachel was polite scotty	indifferent.	11.568363037656766
3719. they ate the cafeteria food with its orange sauces	and scotty gazed without interest at his food the teachers the heroic	baronial windows and the bright ranks of college banners.	5.28961680804392
3720. his father	tried to make the food a topic.	11.234988137387923
3721. the blueberry pie is good	scotty.	10.915477388587384
3722. he looked at his son his face worried.	11.45143587764551
3723. scotty murmured no thanks so softly his father had to	bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him.	5.075687883994028
3724. scotty regarded the ear and the grizzled hair around it with a moment	of interest.	8.042592377505418
3725. he said more loudly i'm full old pop.	12.070853331485324
3726. he	had eaten almost nothing on the crested three-sectioned plate and	had drunk about half the milk in its paper container.	6.757398191382679
3727. he's	all right craig rachel said.	8.254441635698543
3728. i can fix him something later	in the afternoon when we get home.	11.387278593195472
3729. since his seizure scotty	had had little appetite; yet his changed appearance surprisingly	was one of plumpness.	6.14885721093372
3730. his face was fuller; his lips and the usually	sharp lines of his jaw had become swollen-looking.	8.271944585723762
3731. he breathed now	with his mouth open showing a whitely curving section of lower teeth;	he kept his eyes with their puffed blurred lids always lowered	though not apparently focusing.	5.244626481388405
3732. even his neck seemed thicker and	therefore shorter.	11.783128185031327
3733. his hands which had been as quick as a pair of fluttering	birds were now neither active nor really relaxed.	6.2115310653335305
3734. they lay	on his lap palms up stiffly motionless the tapered fingers a little	thick at the joints.	7.8752429876816015
3735. altogether he had since the seizure the appearance	of a boy who overindulged in food and took no exercise.	5.604595862075639
3736. he looked	lazy spoiled a little querulous.	13.671139498061125
3737. rachel had little to say.	8.254441635698543
3738. she greeted her husband's colleagues with smiling politeness offering	nothing.	10.090117903264954
3739. mr mckinley for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity	was completely alert to his son eyes always on the still	face jumping to anticipate scotty's desires.	5.648661358135618
3740. it was a strained silent	lunch.	30.515435481543264
3741. rachel said i'd better get him to bed.	6.764147616291221
3742. the doctors had suggested scotty remain most of every afternoon	in bed until he was stronger.	7.860799503526907
3743. since mr mckinley had to	give a lecture rachel and scotty drove home alone in the plymouth.	5.996449046946254
3744. they did not speak much.	22.990531803625462
3745. scotty gazed out at ugly gray slums and	said softly look at those stupid kids.	5.542917982132687
3746. it was a negro section	of peeling row houses store-front churches and ragged children.	12.681266920840672
3747. rachel	had to bend toward scotty and ask him to repeat.	6.210871206873012
3748. and then: there are lots of kids around here.	11.009801635968275
3749. scotty looked at the children his mouth slightly opened his eyes	dull.	6.409723218970884
3750. he felt tired and full and calm.	14.125486344854538
3751. the	days seemed short perhaps because his routine was each day almost	the same.	5.825820622377272
3752. he rose late and went down in his bathrobe and slippers to	have breakfast either alone or with rachel.	7.8981215668787295
3753. virginia treated him with	attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food: biscuits	cookies candies- the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen.	5.957274431839577
3754. she would hover over him and looking like her brother anxiously	watch the progress of scotty's fork or spoon.	8.703397996334004
3755. you don't	eat enough honey.	15.784668708114987
3756. try to get that down.	19.595663346239842
3757. rachel observing	would say he has to rediscover his own capacity.	8.33019162863444
3758. virginia and rachel talked to each other quietly	now as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war	atmosphere.	7.266636988026677
3759. both watched scotty constantly rachel without seeming	to virginia openly her eyes filled with concern.	6.046518806848467
3760. he did not resent their supervision or virginia's sometimes tiring	sympathy.	14.065201954426886
3761. he ate what he felt like slept as much or as little as	he pleased and moved about the draughty rooms of the house when he	was not in bed with slow dubious steps like an elderly tourist in a	cathedral.	5.3316299597258485
3762. he was able now to sit for hours	in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without	moving.	12.836706744298837
3763. his hands lay loosely yet stiffly- they were like wax hands:	almost lifelike not quite- folded in his lap; his mouth hung	slightly open.	5.172033001815357
3764. when he was asked a question or addressed in such a way	that some response was inescapable he would answer; if as often	happened he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly he would	repeat his words in the same way without emphasis or impatience only	a little louder.	8.052211916435642
3765. he had not mentioned kate.	17.385087763834814
3766. he had not even	thought about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his	slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly almost accidentally encounter	her.	8.445748139687845
3767. at these times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest but	it was an objective pain in no way different from others in intensity	and not different in kind; it was like the bandaged wound on the back	of his head which occasionally throbbed; it was merely another part	of his weakness.	4.940876442566993
3768. he was calm drugged and lazy.	17.218119440805356
3769. rachel mentioned kate.	10.363724110347151
3770. she said i notice the girl from	across the street hasn't bothered to phone or visit.	8.904416859921259
3771. scotty	said that's all right.	9.118533821976325
3772. he thought	about it briefly then deliberately turned the talk to something else.	9.176540466704445
3773. once sitting at the front window in his parents' room he	saw kate come out of her house.	6.741761351765337
3774. they were	far off and looked tiny.	13.133843158043385
3775. the heavy branches in his front yard would hide	and then reveal them.	6.817408452020724
3776. they turned at the bottom of kate's steps	and moved off in the direction of the park.	12.924184431021832
3777. he thought he saw- it	awakened and for a moment interested him- that elizabeth held a	leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash.	7.788275400162423
3778. then they disappeared and scotty got up and went into his own	room and got into bed.	9.057368983580009
3779. by the time he was under the covers he had forgotten	about seeing kate.	10.041928699998516
3780. the doctor since scotty was no longer	allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him came often	and informally to the house.	7.070580168572612
3781. he would sit slim-waisted and spare	on the edge of scotty's bed his legs crossed so elaborately that the	crossed foot could tap the floor.	6.573980990022698
3782. scotty did not mind the doctor's	unsmiling teasing as he used to.	8.07008687651094
3783. husky young man he	said with mock distaste.	7.14162538120728
3784. i imagine you're always battling in school.	12.626880398769476
3785. i don't go to school any more.	6.112009129082544
3786. pardon?	19.804021762487697
3787. 	the doctor had to bend close to hear; his delicate hand as	veined as a moth's wing rested absently on scotty's chest.	4.958070100322966
3788. scotty	said the same words more loudly.	9.670406878971576
3789. well we're taking a	little vacation that's all.	8.760798157016161
3790. he turned unsmilingly to rachel.	18.100149245630604
3791. i	think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little.	9.21614847343009
3792. he could now but the weakness is very definite; it would exhaust	him further and unnecessarily.	9.53230418139413
3793. his stethoscope	was on the table by scotty's bed and he picked it up and wagged	it at scotty.	6.367709358565583
3794. he said fussily just keep the cap on those	strong emotions.	12.944705891190194
3795. the stethoscope glinted silver in the darkening room.	8.341215694113531
3796. i'll drop by again in a few days.	6.780239967936276
3797. rachel stayed	on after the doctor had gone.	7.14162538120728
3798. she smoothed the covers on scotty's	bed and picked things up from the floor.	9.392350469633442
3799. she did not touch him.	12.273782314519758
3800. he did not speak.	31.88991611763428
3801. he had no desire to.	18.187915313983027
3802. she said do you think you'll miss school?	16.30597682975285
3803.    he	had noticed how formal and irritably exact rachel had grown.	6.311161711767532
3804. he felt her irritability did not concern him yet he knew	he would not care even if it did.	9.344965115488222
3805. we've	had any number of calls about you.	8.50355300644976
3806. you could win a popularity contest	at that school without any trouble.	10.759895593422444
3807. she wants to pay you a visit.	9.130734915764195
3808. she says the children miss you.	14.862075846207352
3809. apparently	you were the light of their lives.	9.149249124158029
3810. rachel came close to the bed bent as if she would kiss him	then moved away.	7.984019827911995
3811. that doctor annoys me.	13.51881576711259
3812. she	seemed to speak to herself.	13.01124301923152
3813. do you suppose his self-consciousness	is characteristic of the new negro professionals or merely of doctors	in general?	8.691527388032409
3814.    she turned to him again.	15.335982124924552
3815. well mrs	charles- sally- has phoned too.	9.543751478423268
3816. rachel's	tone was dry.	13.148092146312546
3817. she didn't really say- she glanced	away at the floor then swooped gracefully and picked up one of scotty's	slippers.	5.31480095063949
3818. i mean do you feel like seeing kate?	13.451099661709948
3819. 	scotty said i don't know.	8.254441635698543
3820. he did not.	32.52333993947455
3821. there	was the slight pain but it was no different from the throbbing in	his head.	7.974568851304067
3822. well there's time in any case.	12.107821717729271
3823. we'll wait	till you're stronger and then talk about it.	4.458094500389624
3824. she put the slipper	neatly	by its mate at the foot of the bed.	11.353078798917355
3825. this time rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead.	9.594024245618197
3826. his father was a constant visitor.	12.897597508911213
3827. scotty	would hear the front door in the evening and then his father's deep	slow voice; it floated up the stairs.	5.269029615408402
3828. how's scotty?	15.594944937291627
3829. 	and rachel's or virginia's reply: better.	7.622507342753323
3830. he's	getting plenty of rest.	11.568363037656766
3831. is his appetite improved?	14.719789192420528
3832. 	or: does he get exercise?	10.472119682746735
3833.    the exchange was almost	invariable and scotty in his bed could hear every word of it.	6.196120048044738
3834. it required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical	about his father.	10.055014982183309
3835. his father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously	at the foot of the bed and look at his son.	7.012306084063896
3836. after a pause	during which he studied scotty's face as if scotty were not there	and could not study him too mr mckinley would ask the same	questions he had asked downstairs.	6.734611063080708
3837. scotty would reply softly and	his father apologetically would ask him to repeat.	5.825820622377272
3838. i'm	eating more he would say.	10.472119682746735
3839. or: i walk around the house a	lot.	7.8266524205191335
3840. perhaps you should get out a little.	13.562096499361068
3841. i'm	not supposed to yet.	9.118533821976325
3842. he did not mind	the useless kindly questions.	18.941806343485823
3843. he looked at the lined face with vague	interest; he felt he was noting it as if it were something he might	think about when he grew stronger.	6.371497862601417
3844. mr mckinley examined	everything with critical care seeking something material to blame for	his son's illness.	7.901022633568577
3845. have you got enough blankets?	17.15076508346365
3846.  and	another time without accusation: you never wore that scarf	i bought you.	7.615092762846159
3847. where their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves thrusting themselves	upward in angry motion papa-san sat glacier-like his smooth solidity	his very immobility defying all the turmoil about him.	4.986814429091791
3848. our	objective the colonel had said that day of the briefing is papa-san.	8.451539404280124
3849. there the objective sat brooding over all.	14.436945989394015
3850. gouge burn	blast insult it as they would could anyone really take papa-san?	7.855879470192429
3851. 	between the ponderous hulk and himself in the valley over which	papa-san reigned men had hidden high explosives booby traps and	mines.	5.600506566635469
3852. the raped valley was a pregnant womb awaiting abortion.	9.945332631078985
3853. on	the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed	wire.	8.296392737726348
3854. at the slope's base coils of concertina stretched out of eye	range like a wild tangle of children's hoops stopped simultaneously	weirdly poised as if awaiting the magic of the child's touch to	start them all rolling again.	6.236576364496245
3855. closer still regular barricades of barbed	wire hung on timber supports.	6.210871206873012
3856. was it all vain labor?	17.167214565760016
3857.  who would	clean up the mess when the war was over?	9.000402973139026
3858.  smiling at his quixotic	thoughts warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before	sitting down.	7.063751019154169
3859. tonight a group of men tomorrow night he himself	would go out there somewhere and wait.	6.9194879198136
3860. if he were to go with white	he would be out there two days not just listening in the dark at some	point between here and papa-san but moving ever deeper into enemy	land- behind papa-san itself.	8.463138312685151
3861. was this what he had expected?	9.310843321026303
3862.  he	hadn't realized that there would be so much time to think so many	lulls.	10.763302283764958
3863. somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told that combat	was an intermittent activity.	6.467750816518099
3864. now he knew that the moment illuminated	by the vision on the train would have to be approached.	12.691321895942872
3865. it could	take place tomorrow night or it might occur months from now.	8.132629406549228
3866. there	was just too much time.	12.265494728674685
3867. white's suggestion	flattered but he did not like the identity.	8.882486834490086
3868. he did not spill over with	hatred for the enemy.	15.29707057065577
3869. he hadn't even seen him yet h   pressing	his cigarette out in the earth warren walked to the slit and	scanned the jagged hills.	7.327099184519166
3870. he saw no life but still stood there for	a time peering at the unlovely hills his gaze continually returning to	papa-san.	7.605156370559649
3871. he had come here in order to test himself.	13.773606083787389
3872. while most of	his beliefs were still unsettled he knew that he did not believe in	killing.	10.91613913650053
3873. he had come because he could not live out	his life feeling that he had been a coward.	10.540719303208638
3874. there were ten men	on the patrol which sergeant prevot led out that next night.	10.732511993673237
3875. the	beaming rok was carrying a thirty-caliber machine gun; another	man lugged the tripod and a box of ammunition.	5.236383152695367
3876. warren and white each	carried in addition to their own weapons and ammo a box of ammo for	the rok's machine gun.	7.669666636970978
3877. others carried extra clips for the	browning automatic rifle which was in the hands of a little mexican	named martinez.	8.877600080606834
3878. prevot had briefed the two new men that afternoon.	8.196044167676531
3879. we just sit quiet and wait prevot had said.	8.396496230546957
3880. be sure the	man nearest you is awake.	16.717572823539694
3881. if joe doesn't show up we'll all be	back here at 0600 hours.	7.521433978470609
3882. otherwise we hold a reception.	12.555741634523304
3883. then we pull	out under our mortar and artillery cover but nobody pulls out until	i say so.	6.719624584878343
3884. remember what i said about going out to get anybody left	behind?	8.816401612739652
3885.  that still holds.	16.25399040225975
3886. we bring back all dead and wounded.	12.350455461918722
3887. at 2130 hours they had passed through the barbed wire at the	point of departure.	6.82061128984752
3888. then began the journey through their own mine fields.	9.79567574476966
3889. ours were kinder than theirs some said.	7.14162538120728
3890. they set bouncing	betties to jump and explode at testicle level while we more mercifully	had them go off at the head.	7.231737476099396
3891. the crude	wooden boxes of the enemy our nicely turned gray metal disks.	0.0
3892. but	theirs defied the detectors.	11.568363037656766
3893. a foot misplaced a leg missing.	9.356345845066523
3894. all sizes: big ones some wired to set off a whole field	little ones hand grenade size.	7.957342234941497
3895. booby traps to fill the head with	chunks of metal.	7.3800326108703675
3896. warren tried to shake off the jumble of his fears by	looking at the sky.	7.032105024464237
3897. prevot had said that the searchlights	would be bounced off the clouds at 2230 hours which gives us time	to get settled in position.	5.413608941102272
3898. because they were new men and	to be sure that they didn't get lost prevot had placed warren	and white in the center of the patrol as it filed out.	10.492371566044683
3899. his eyes now	fixed on white's solid figure warren could hear behind him the tread	of another.	6.052483915567135
3900. he could also hear the stream which he had seen from	his position.	11.73959369208351
3901. they were going to follow it for part of their journey.	14.726868208103289
3902. it's safe prevot had said and it provides cover for our	noise.	4.638829243364722
3903. soon they were picking their way along the edge of	the stream which glowed in the night.	7.330586228560816
3904. on their right rose the embankment	covered with brush and trees.	11.056596564047293
3905. if a branch extended out too far	each man held it back for the next and if they met a low overhang each	warned the other.	6.753341378197391
3906. thus stealthily they advanced upstream; then	they turned to the right climbed the embankment and walked into the	valley again.	8.791135668407959
3907. there was no cover here only grass sighing against	pant-legs.	14.170519501784666
3908. and with each sigh like a whip in the hand of an expert	the grass stripped something from warren.	8.218303585246003
3909. the gentle whir of each footstep	left him more naked than before until he felt his unprotected	flesh tremble chilled by each new sound.	5.443811168067202
3910. the shapes of the men ahead	of him lacked solidity as if the whip had stripped them of their very	flesh.	9.182606538758252
3911. the dark forms moved like mourners on some nocturnal pilgrimage	their dirge unsung for want of vocal chords.	6.157866614711012
3912. the warped broken	trees in the valley assumed wraith-like shapes.	10.305551326325668
3913. clumps of brush that	they passed were so many enchained demons straining	in anger to tear and gnaw on his bones.	5.083242045036259
3914. looming over all papa-san	leered down at him threatening a hundred hidden malevolencies.	7.391013650626644
3915. off in	the distance a searchlight flashed on its beam slashing the sky.	6.878586597189155
3916. the	sharp ray was absorbed by a cloud then reflected to the earth in a	softer diffused radiance.	7.174415361014294
3917. somewhere over there another patrol had need	of light.	8.533483649870792
3918. warren thought of all the men out that night who like	himself had left their protective ridge and- fear working at their	guts- picked their way into the area beyond.	6.884759142771981
3919. from the east to the west	coast of the korean peninsula was a strip of land in which fear-filled	men were at that same moment furtively crawling through the night	sitting in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound or shouting	amidst confused rifle flashes and muzzle blasts.	5.2791090844058965
3920. white's arm went	up and warren raised his own.	8.581436094141479
3921. prevot	came up take that spot over there he whispered pointing to	a small clump of blackness.	5.427950274147271
3922. give me your machine gun ammo.	12.276863862690671
3923. warren	handed him the metal box and prevot quietly disappeared down the	line.	6.002446559592496
3924. lying in the grass behind the brush clump warren looked	about.	8.354365827194131
3925. the others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and	the brush.	9.219448584977116
3926. over his shoulder he could see prevot with the machine gun	crew.	9.815925849460228
3927. even at this short distance they were only vague shapes setting	up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the	heads of the rest of the patrol.	7.024889938903743
3928. warren eased his rifle's	safety off and gently slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from	one of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part of his body with	an x.	6.166422474275599
3929. this he placed within quick reach.	12.245409015232283
3930. the walk and his fears	had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch	of the night air.	7.068970569960655
3931. although the armored vest fitted the upper part	of his body snugly he felt no security.	6.716115690045228
3932. figures seemed to crouch in	the surrounding dark; in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed	to advance and retreat even as he watched.	7.4410415811352655
3933. certain this menace was	only imaginary he yet stared in fascinated horror his hand sticky against	the stock of his weapon.	5.320097649352637
3934. he was aware of insistent inner beatings	as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body.	9.016975878454005
3935. above the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight pointed at the clouds	diluting the valley's dark to a pallid light.	5.568148433678107
3936. then the figures	which held his attention became a group of shattered trees standing	like the grotesques of a medieval damnation scene.	8.180004365981466
3937. even so he could	not ease the tension of his body; the rough surface of the earth itself	seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax.	7.143718324473617
3938. sensing the	unseen presence of the other men in the patrol he felt mutely united	to these nine near-strangers sharing this pinpoint of being with him.	7.051377857313717
3939. he sensed something precious in the perilous moment something akin	to the knowledge gained on his bicycle trip through the french countryside	a knowledge imprisoned in speechlessness.	5.370135919572722
3940. in france	he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown	up to the sky and always as he wandered he felt a stranger to their	exultation.	8.527383819790932
3941. they were poems in a strange language of which he could	barely touch a meaning- enough to make his being ache with the desire	for the fullness he sensed there.	6.229259881487513
3942. brittany that stone-gray mystery	through which he traveled for thirty days sleeping in the barns of	farmers or alongside roads had worked some subtle change in him he	knew and it was in brittany that he had met pierre.	6.789561442299042
3943. pierre	had no hands; they had been severed at the wrists.	6.872206062958677
3944. with leather cups	fitted in his handlebars he steered his bicycle.	9.821725517303781
3945. he and warren had	traveled together for four days.	10.594409592502195
3946. they visited the shipyards at brest	and pierre had to sign the register vouching for the integrity of	the visiting foreigner.	7.367001582299765
3947. he took the pen in his stumps and began to	write.	9.313327143771092
3948. wait! wait! cried the guard who ran from the	hut to shout to other men standing about outside.	6.934274960433971
3949. they crowded the small	room and peered over one another's shoulders to watch the handless	man write his name in the book.	6.927946045159832
3950. c'est merveilleux.	15.594944937291627
3951. and then the questions came eager interested questions and many compliments	on his having overcome his infirmity.	7.243120492747014
3952. doesn't it	ever bother you warren had asked to have people always asking	you about your hands?	6.886249538313906
3953.    oh the french are a very curious	people pierre had laughed.	7.641263869103429
3954. they are also honest seekers	after truth.	17.70595667306046
3955. now the english are painfully silent about my missing	hands.	8.907214557739332
3956. they refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there.	11.183423554824664
3957. the	americans like yourself take the fact for granted try to be helpful	but don't ask questions.	5.427950274147271
3958. i'm used to all three but i think	the french have the healthiest attitude.	4.94962672496911
3959. that was the day	that pierre had told warren about the abbey of solesmes.	8.548898101043001
3960. you	are looking tired and there you can rest.	8.581436094141479
3961. it will be good for you.	23.83609541655486
3962. i think too he said his dark eyes mischievous that you will	find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals about which you	have spoken.	9.213070561970492
3963. within two weeks warren was ringing the bell	at the abbey gate.	7.09658821586944
3964. the monk who opened the door immediately calmed his	worries about his reception: i speak english the old man	said but i do not hear it very well.	7.685936816567552
3965. he smiled and stuck a large	finger with white hairs sprouting on it into his ear as though that	might help.	6.276119584179756
3966. smiling at warren's protestations the old monk took	his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor.	6.843555082570595
3967. will	you please wait in here.	8.254441635698543
3968. mickie sat over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next	to the funeral parlor on pennsylvania avenue.	7.296796623354769
3969. al's little cafe	was small dark narrow and filled with the mingled scent of beer	tobacco smoke and italian cooking.	5.373451013152963
3970. hanging over the bar was an oil	painting of a nude al had accepted from a student at the corcoran	gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke.	6.566399768363132
3971. the nude was small	and black-haired and elfin and was called eloise.	7.098087065137257
3972. this	was one place where moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without	anyone noticing him or at least coming up and hanging around and	wanting to know all the low-down.	6.436186552389852
3973. the other patrons were taxi drivers	and art students and small shopkeepers.	8.370415405903303
3974. the reporters had not yet	discovered that this was his hideaway.	11.272653478106982
3975. his friend jane was with	him.	9.627882438407596
3976. she was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even	if he did weigh too much and didn't own the mint.	7.269213011679201
3977. she was the widow	of a writer who had died in an airplane crash and mickie had found	her a job as head of the historical section of the treasury.	7.298731519771195
3978. this	meant sorting out press clippings and the like.	8.581436094141479
3979. jane sat receptive	and interested.	9.118533821976325
3980. mickie had a pleasant glow as he said you see	both of them i mean the president and jeff lawrence are romantics.	7.137155741379015
3981. a romantic is one who thinks the world is divinely inspired and	all he has to do is find the right key and then divine justice and	altruism will appear.	7.800647703425855
3982. it's like focusing a camera; the distant ship	isn't there until you get the focus.	4.339177297207683
3983. you know what i'm talking	about.	19.236453652028427
3984. i'm sure all girls feel this way about men until they live	with them.	4.94962672496911
3985. but when it comes to war the colonel knows what	it is and jeff doesn't.	9.768034516529452
3986. mr christiansen knows that a soldier	will get the distinguished service medal for conduct that would land	him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian.	6.3670418324942375
3987. he had	a mean unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit and someone invented the	name trig for him.	6.3332044950364645
3988. that's to say he was trigger happy.	6.649323994041028
3989. he'd	shoot at anything if it was the rear end of a horse or his own sentry.	7.973846679428707
3990. he was a wiry inscrutable silent country boy from the red clay of	rural alabama and he spoke with the broad drawl that others normally	make fun of.	7.911444852196346
3991. but not in front of trig.	17.815501676159066
3992. i heard of some that tried	it back in the states and he'd knock them clear across the room.	10.947344142134352
3993. there'd been a pretty bad incident back at the marine base.	6.900408649199245
3994. a new	york kid a refugee from one of the harlem gangs made fun of trig's	accent and drew a knife.	9.016904301558275
3995. before the fight was over the harlem	boy had a concussion and trig was cut up badly.	6.903451359553042
3996. they caught trig	stealing liquor from the officers' mess and he got a couple of girls	in trouble.	9.162177921266771
3997. the fear of punishment just didn't bother him.	10.695878637103357
3998. it was left out of him at birth.	16.571667076119464
3999. this is why he made such	a magnificent soldier.	13.11970684978437
4000. he wasn't troubled with the ordinary rank-and-file	fear that overcomes and paralyzes and sends individual soldiers	and whole companies under fire running in panic.	7.107239517072066
4001. it just didn't	occur to trig that anything serious would happen to him.	8.132629406549228
4002. do you get	the picture of the kind of fellow he was?	15.879693689924276
4003.    jane nodded	with a pleasant smile.	8.254441635698543
4004. there was a sniper's nest	in a mountain cave and it was picking off our men with devilish accuracy.	11.586749057686566
4005. the colonel ordered that it be wiped out and i suggested	'you ask for volunteers and promise each man on the patrol a quart	of whisky ten dollars and a week-end pass to davao'.	5.2620688406106835
4006. trig was	one of the five volunteers.	11.595729915558739
4007. the patrol snaked around in back of the cave	approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild howls.	6.4330293860001175
4008. you could hear them from our outpost.	15.205456267605188
4009. there was a lot of shooting.	26.074228451143995
4010. we knew the enemy was subdued because a flare was fired as the signal.	8.497743810732977
4011. two of our men were killed a third was wounded.	8.56990238059521
4012. trig and a very black colored boy from detroit had killed or put	out of action ten guerrillas by grenades and hand-to-hand fighting.	6.387218653107389
4013. when	we got there trig and the negro were quarreling over possession	of a gold crucifix around the neck of a wounded filipino.	5.668934503289825
4014. the colored	boy had it and trig lunged at him with a knife and said 'give	that to me you black bastard.	7.561791374268533
4015. we don't 'low nigras to walk on	the same sidewalk with white men where i come from'.	4.937785882748293
4016. the	negro got a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound.	7.391013650626644
4017. what	did the colonel do about the men?	7.74618850463512
4018.  jane asked in her placid	interested way.	9.670406878971576
4019. he recommended both of	them for the dsm and the detroit fellow for the purple heart	too for a combat-inflicted wound.	5.909009505545415
4020. so you see mr christiansen	knows what it's all about.	12.80482872241089
4021. when he was in	the war he was in law or supplies or something like that and an	old buddy of his told me he would come down on sundays to the pentagon	and read the citations for medals- just like the one we sent in for	trig- and go away with a real glow.	5.336152245168896
4022. these were heroes nine feet	tall to him.	11.217122601447842
4023. jefferson lawrence was alone at the small perfectly	appointed table by the window looking out over the river.	5.467781152199419
4024. he	had dinner and sat there over his coffee watching the winding pattern	of traffic as it crossed the bridge and spread out like a serpent with	two heads.	6.04160250570423
4025. open beside him was mrs dalloway.	7.622507342753323
4026. he thought how	this dainty fragile older woman threading her way through the streets	of westminster on a day in june enjoying the flowers in the shops	the greetings from old friends but never really drawing a deep passionate	breath was so like himself.	6.143462819680892
4027. he and mrs dalloway too	had never permitted themselves the luxury of joys that dug into the	bone marrow of the spirit.	6.95284775577173
4028. he had not because he was both poor	and ambitious.	17.278427490814405
4029. poverty imposes a kind of chastity on the ambitious.	7.440434150261191
4030. they cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of cars	along a dark country lane.	8.749073208907845
4031. no they must look the other way and climb	one more painful step up the ladder.	6.88087869880284
4032. he made the decision with his	eyes open or so he thought.	11.845040990655484
4033. at any cost he must leave the dreary pennsylvania	mining town where his father was a pharmacist.	7.365609736889559
4034. and so he	had so he had.	15.821470211811052
4035. at state college he had no time to walk among the	violets on the water's edge.	7.098238266653304
4036. from his room he could look out in springtime	and see the couples hand in hand walking slowly deliciously	across the campus and he could smell the sweet vernal winds.	7.472555169900006
4037. he was not unmoved.	24.294131809332526
4038. he had to teach himself patiently that	these traps were not for him.	12.940307180984714
4039. he must mentally pull the blinds and	close the window so that all that existed was in the books before him.	7.503955145591806
4040. at law school the same.	15.856388984279766
4041. more of this stamping down of human emotion	as a young lawyer in new york.	6.50457063925392
4042. by the time he was prosperous enough-	his goals were high- he was bald and afraid of women.	10.103282743512988
4043. the only	one who would have him was his cripple the strange unhappy woman	who became his wife.	6.362404746904975
4044. perhaps it was right; perhaps it was just.	11.544045395859738
4045. he	had dared to defy nature to turn his back to the lorelei and he was	punished.	6.083075552994771
4046. like mrs dalloway with her regrets about peter walsh	he had his moments of melancholy over a youth too well spent.	6.9306103296216595
4047. if	he had had a son he would tell him gather ye rosebuds while ye	may h this same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying.	5.259250068590943
4048. but then his son could afford it.	14.76346545701299
4049. lawrence was waiting for bill	boxell.	8.457993590206913
4050. the vice president had called and asked if he could see	the secretary at his home.	10.323659751601646
4051. he said the matter was urgent.	19.05472708829219
4052. the secretary	was uneasy about the visit.	12.435529358277208
4053. he did not like boxell.	20.330024155874902
4054. he suspected	something underhanded and furtive about him.	12.411802052220429
4055. lawrence could not	put his finger on it precisely and this worried him.	6.270230978211473
4056. when you disliked	or distrusted a man you should have a reason.	13.748470019984957
4057. human nature was	not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell.	6.083087477792876
4058. lawrence stared	a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic hoping that a clue to his	dislike of the vice president would appear.	7.213952254160464
4059. therefore	he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort	to understand and sympathize with his point of view.	5.710809277086228
4060. a half	hour later the vice president arrived.	14.610431577057728
4061. he looked very carefully at	every piece of furnishing as though hoping to store this information	carefully in his mind.	6.034462242787552
4062. he observed the florentine vase in the hall	the renoir painting in the library as well as the long shelves of well-bound	volumes; the pattern of the oriental rug the delicate cut-glass	chandelier.	7.776704065940372
4063. he said to the secretary i understand	you came from a little pennsylvania town near wilkes-barre.	8.867119331729759
4064. how did	you find out about this?	13.54281504179816
4065.  he waved his arm around at the furnishings.	9.79832335641565
4066. it was not a discourteous question lawrence decided.	22.972559927717377
4067. this young man had so little time to learn he had to be curious;	he had to find out.	7.6422083670810785
4068. the secretary did not tell him at what cost at	what loneliness he learned these things.	9.610831677445065
4069. he merely said any good	decorator these days can make you a tasteful home.	7.073530828549074
4070. the vice	president said if you hear of any names that would fix me cheap	in return for advertising they decorated the vice president's	home let me know.	6.593952525060604
4071. i can do business with that kind.	14.372022673115191
4072. again	lawrence thought a little sadly these were the fees of poverty and	ambition.	7.8222354323124605
4073. boxell did not have the chance to grow up graciously.	10.585171135942144
4074. he	had to acquire everything he was going to get in four years.	10.082554333190416
4075. they	had brandy in the library.	8.254441635698543
4076. boxell looked at lawrence with a searching	glance the kind that a prosecuting attorney would give a man on trial.	6.668801270201478
4077. what are your weaknesses?	21.41654570467301
4078.  where will you break?	15.215005521174389
4079.  how best to	destroy your peace?	10.972963376784424
4080.    the vice president said with a slight	bluster there isn't anyone who loves the president more than	i do.	9.398340440704608
4081. old chris is my ideal.	9.51303048330792
4082. at the same time you have to face facts	and realize that a man who's been in the marine corps all his	life doesn't understand much about politics.	11.710879678806883
4083. what does a monk know	about sex?	13.74481942632004
4084.    lawrence listened with the practiced deceptive	calm of the lawyer but his face was in the shadow.	8.305695739396771
4085. so	we have to protect the old man for his own good.	7.690411598223095
4086. you see what i mean.	17.055565169455456
4087. congress is full of politicians and if you want to get along with	them you have to be politic.	10.599893226151762
4088. this is why i say we just can't go ahead	and disarm the germans and pull down our own defenses.	9.111666191624566
4089. let me tell	you what happened to me today.	11.467997470506809
4090. a fellow came up to me a senator	i don't have to tell you his name and he told me 'i love the	president like a brother but god damn it he's crucifying me.	7.584054017879749
4091. i've	got a quarter of a million germans in my state and those krautheads	tune in on father werther every night and if he tells them to	go out and piss in the public square that's what they do.	5.204209181959247
4092. he's	telling them now to write letters to their congressmen opposing the disarmament	of germany'.	7.198778874655976
4093. and another one comes to me and he says 'look	here there's a mill in my state employs five thousand people	making uniforms for the navy.	5.502980726983288
4094. the bishop looked at him coldly and said take it or leave it!	literally there was nothing else to do.	7.46963899862977
4095. he was caught in	a machine.	15.66991192537313
4096. but sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite	calmly: let's go and see what it's like.	8.533918090730575
4097. annisberg	was about seventy-five miles west of birmingham near the georgia	border and on the tallahoosa river a small and dirty stream.	5.754719457262468
4098. the	city was a center of manufacture especially in textiles and also	because of the beauty of some of its surroundings a residence for many	owners of the great industries in north alabama.	6.986076066603427
4099. but it had as was	usual in southern cities of this sort a black bottom a low region	near the river where the negroes lived- servants and laborers huddled	together in a region with no sewage save the river where streets	and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime.	5.5168619500945075
4100. wilson came by train from birmingham and looked the city	over; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief	stores were.	6.884568280551431
4101. beyond were industries and factories.	9.558171024372111
4102. then they went down	to black bottom.	14.632673295728583
4103. in the midst of this crowded region was the allen	african methodist episcopal church.	10.970738805048743
4104. it was an old and dirty	wooden structure sadly in need of repair.	18.08310427165421
4105. but it was a landmark.	29.83365285341607
4106. it	had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town black and white	knew of it.	6.757567981697296
4107. it had just suffered a calamity the final crisis in a	long series of calamities.	8.334096723226134
4108. for the old preacher who had been there twenty-five	years was dead and the city mourned him.	11.98142364419002
4109. he was a	loud-voiced man once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength	and ability.	8.899333784405911
4110. he was stern and overbearing with his flock but obsequious	and conciliatory with the whites especially the rich who partly	supported the church.	7.9227498926993345
4111. the deacon board headed by a black man	named carlson had practically taken over as the pastor grew old and	had its way with the support of the amen corner.	6.2108105668867095
4112. the characteristic	thing about this church was its amen corner and the weekly religious	orgy.	8.753976239846834
4113. a knot of old worshippers chiefly women listened weekly to a	sermon.	6.881248562988826
4114. it began invariably in low tones almost conversational and	then gradually worked up to high shrill appeals to god and man.	8.594616403114236
4115. and	then the amen corner took hold re-enacting a form of group participation	in worship that stemmed from years before the greek chorus spreading	down through the african forest overseas to the west indies	and then here in alabama.	5.070089962370865
4116. with shout and slow dance with tears and	song with scream and contortion the corner group was beset by hysteria	and shivering wailing shouting possession of something that seemed	like an alien and outside force.	6.278022520193552
4117. it spread to most of the audience	and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief	and afterward discussed negro religion.	7.027362908103144
4118. it sometimes ended in	death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and	floor.	9.595179618611068
4119. to most of those who composed the amen corner it was a magnificent	and beautiful experience something for which they lived from week	to week.	6.438267007170167
4120. it was often re-enacted in less wild form at the wednesday	night prayer meeting.	11.83382825905555
4121. wilson on his first sunday witnessed	this with something like disgust.	6.516863734099137
4122. he had preached a short sermon	trying to talk man-to-man to the audience to tell them who he was what	he had done in macon and birmingham and what he proposed to do here.	7.199829561011755
4123. he sympathized with them on the loss of their old pastor.	9.867121291849172
4124. but then	at mention of that name the amen corner broke loose.	9.887008010130634
4125. he had no	chance to say another word.	12.04121248550523
4126. at the very end when the audience was silent	and breathless a collection was taken and then slowly everyone	filed out.	10.016267248996382
4127. the audience did not think much of the new pastor and what	the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to	say.	9.196272844352492
4128. during the next weeks he looked over the situation.	13.458885930772936
4129. first	of all there was the parsonage an utterly impossible place for civilized	people to live in originally poorly conceived apparently not	repaired for years with no plumbing or sewage with rat-holes and rot.	5.314967456377934
4130. it was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old	members of the church a woman named catt who as wilson afterward found	was briefly referred to as the cat because of her sharp tongue	and fierce initiative.	10.22591759336713
4131. ann catt was a lonely devoted soul	never married conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church but	a perpetual dissenter and born critic.	4.853876284793092
4132. she soared over the new pastor	like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all	the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository.	6.605421511263822
4133. then	wilson looked over the church and studied its condition.	7.385487783748222
4134. the salary	of the pastor had for years been $500 annually and even this was in arrears.	8.091536790622461
4135. wilson made up his mind that he must receive at least $2500	but when he mentioned this to the deacons they said nothing.	5.573106267614707
4136. the church	itself must be repaired.	13.848082117783294
4137. it was dirty and neglected.	19.850098703869534
4138. it really	ought to be rebuilt and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks	about this.	10.43060658908787
4139. meanwhile the city itself should be talked to.	7.636059201849566
4140. the	streets in the colored section were dirty.	9.060328853487057
4141. there was typhoid and malaria.	21.7716679430166
4142. the children had nowhere to go and no place to play not even sidewalks.	9.593362331736131
4143. the school was small dark and ill-equipped.	11.455306854406768
4144. the teacher was	a pliant fool.	14.999557723317405
4145. there were two liquor saloons not very far from the	church one white that is conducted for white people with a side entrance	for negroes; the other exclusively negro.	6.7213399930878435
4146. undoubtedly there	was a good deal of gambling in both.	12.936508415663305
4147. on the other side of the	church	was a quiet well-kept house with shutters and recently painted.	12.869044186469903
4148. it was called kent house.	25.183121828889895
4149. the deacon of the	church carlson was its janitor.	8.341215694113531
4150. one of the leading members of the	amen corner was cook; there were two or three colored maids employed	there.	11.93819325922899
4151. wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people	which seemed to him rather queer.	8.05500015410395
4152. why should a white hotel be set	down in the center of black bottom?	12.977939577030247
4153.  but nevertheless it looked respectable.	12.754707820148809
4154. he was glad to have it there.	19.15240723478714
4155. the rest of black	bottom was a rabbit warren of homes in every condition of neglect disrepair	and careful upkeep.	7.44374501378252
4156. dives carefully repaired huts and nicely	painted and ornamented cottages were jumbled together cheek by jowl	with little distinction.	6.643215071337043
4157. the best could not escape from the worst and	the worst nestled cosily beside the better.	7.6529402329617255
4158. the yards front and back	were narrow; some were trash dumps some had flower gardens.	8.086542342015262
4159. behind	were privies for there was no sewage system.	7.653601020561708
4160. after looking	about a bit wilson discovered beyond black bottom across the river	and far removed from the white city a considerable tract of land	and it occurred to him that the church and the better negro homes might	gradually be moved to this plot.	7.929117189416618
4161. he talked about it to the presiding	elder.	14.630508753993844
4162. the presiding elder looked him over rather carefully.	10.582206877639416
4163. he was not sure what kind of a man he had in hand.	15.884332599929632
4164. but there was one	thing that he had to stress and that was that the contribution to the	general church expenses the dollar money had been seriously falling	behind in this church and that must be looked after immediately.	9.221131177780968
4165. in	fact he intimated clearly that that was the reason that wilson had	been sent here- to make a larger contribution of dollar money.	6.0564973127400465
4166. wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was they must have a	better church a more business-like conduct of the church organization	and an effort to get this religious center out of its rut of wild worship	into a modern church organization.	7.342935676310371
4167. he emphasized to the presiding	elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the	river.	6.439595759415219
4168. the presiding elder was sure that that would be impossible.	10.729090937971694
4169. but he told wilson to go ahead and try.	10.75194201125051
4170. it did seem impossible.	24.75927199542884
4171. the bank which held the mortgage on the	old church declared that the interest was considerably in arrears and	the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was	being held for an eventual development for white working people who	were coming in and that none would be sold to colored folk.	4.820555874189618
4172. when it	was proposed to rebuild the church wilson found that the terms for	a new mortgage were very high.	8.755751031749407
4173. he was sure that he could do better if	he went to atlanta to get the deal financed.	9.203412418962596
4174. but when this proposal	was made to his deacon board he met unanimous opposition.	10.215870303682975
4175. the	church certainly would not be removed.	8.96838536629507
4176. the very proposition was sacrilege.	16.033001055199488
4177. it had been here fifty years.	18.299326770197176
4178. it was going to stay forever.	27.255419268624163
4179. it was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject.	10.378460555905608
4180. as for	rebuilding well that might be looked into but there was no hurry no	hurry at all.	10.867479437125956
4181. wilson again went downtown to a different banker	an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic but	he shook his head.	5.0176589645046334
4182. reverend he said i think you don't	quite understand the situation here.	0.0
4183. don't you see the amount	of money that has been invested by whites around that church?	3.9790688654043005
4184.  tenements	stores saloons some gambling i hope not too much.	9.000704363759485
4185. the colored	people are getting employment at kent house and other places and	they are near their places of employment.	5.780140237098333
4186. when a city has arranged	things like this you cannot easily change them.	10.283124722949914
4187. now if i were you i	would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or	ten years.	6.775703136409774
4188. by that time perhaps something better can be done.	12.071008009264158
4189. then wilson asked what about this kent house which you	mention?	7.329121340894081
4190.  i don't understand why a white hotel should be down here.	6.137089255931398
4191. the young banker looked at him with a certain surprise and	then he said flatly: i'm afraid i can't tell you anything	in particular about kent house.	5.644884838589291
4192. you'll have to find out about it	on your own.	7.207272899677013
4193. hope to see you again.	12.214744385344263
4194. and he dismissed the colored	pastor.	18.6455711886152
4195. it was next day that sojourner came and sat beside	him and took his hand.	8.595594853566553
4196. she said my dear do you know what kent	house is?	12.330812418036162
4197.    no said wilson i don't.	11.332117804292446
4198. i was	just asking about it.	15.711603260075847
4199. what is it?	22.366870059233243
4200.    it's a house of prostitution	for white men with white girls as inmates.	3.4936223063316043
4201. they hire	a good deal of local labor including two members of our trustee board.	9.31729119302697
4202. they buy some supplies from our colored grocers and they are patronized	by some of the best white gentlemen in town.	9.293485124803489
4203. my dear you must be mistaken.	10.660996355506088
4204. talk to	mrs catt she said.	10.472119682746735
4205. and after wilson had talked to mrs	catt and to others he was absolutely amazed.	6.860081853048783
4206. this of course was	the sort of thing that used to take place in southern cities- putting	white houses of prostitution with colored girls in colored neighborhoods	and carrying them on openly.	8.584740154993558
4207. but it had largely disappeared on	account of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on the	part of the negroes as they became more educated and got better wages.	6.151590641594508
4208. but this situation of kent house was more subtle.	12.87326691560361
4209. the wages	involved were larger and more regular.	10.264958660030445
4210. the inmates were white and	from out of town avoiding local friction.	0.0
4211. the backing from the white	town was greater and there was little publicity.	8.375617950829195
4212. good wages patronage	and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from negroes.	8.318146180074157
4213. and yet wilson knew that this place must go or he must go.	7.617733388754742
4214. and	for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean	practically the end of his career in the methodist church if not	in all churches.	7.833730845854899
4215. payne dismounted in madison place and handed the reins to herold.	6.002446559592496
4216. there was a fog which increased the darkness of the night.	15.754796507539712
4217. two gas	lamps were no more than a misleading glow.	10.023862070503291
4218. he might have been anywhere	or nowhere.	24.795881148258214
4219. the pretence was that he was delivering a prescription	from dr verdi.	9.696460767325938
4220. secretary of state seward was a sick man.	18.30005753862193
4221. the idea had come from herold who had once been a chemist's clerk.	10.136421029681758
4222. the sick were always receiving medicines.	12.435529358277208
4223. no one would question	such an errand.	11.752610894633738
4224. the bottle was filled up with flour.	11.387658710676023
4225. before payne	loomed the old clubhouse seward's home where key had once	been killed.	6.791049676473546
4226. now it would have another death.	16.902017194967502
4227. from the outside it	was an ordinary enough house of the gentry.	9.939403796736036
4228. he clomped heavily up the	stoop and rang the bell.	10.697093789223626
4229. like the bell at mass the doorbell was pitched	too high.	8.164834827984482
4230. it was still good friday after all.	24.046192298808823
4231. a nigger	boy opened the door.	10.365396994212828
4232. payne did not notice him.	10.472119682746735
4233. he was thinking chiefly	of cap.	15.66991192537313
4234. if their schedules were to synchronize there was no point	in wasting time.	10.46856370278829
4235. he pushed his way inside.	12.127026643485452
4236. for a moment	the hall confused him.	16.053662453256113
4237. this was the largest house he had ever been in	almost the largest building except for a hotel.	8.781996267410449
4238. he had no idea where	seward's room would be.	15.519630936676606
4239. in the half darkness the banisters gleamed	and the hall seemed enormous.	10.001211252328778
4240. above him somewhere were the bedrooms.	11.92492840344405
4241. seward would be up there.	8.254441635698543
4242. he explained his errand but without	bothering much to make it plausible for he felt something well	up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army.	7.987102166051926
4243. he did not	really want to kill but as in the sexual act there was a moment when	the impulse took over and could not be downed even while you watched	yourself giving way to it.	7.178984144286146
4244. he was no longer worried.	23.537732141561968
4245. everything would	be all right.	10.723035751546695
4246. he knew that in this mood he could not be stopped.	18.47452429002794
4247. still the sensation always surprised him.	10.138626219858931
4248. it was a thrill he	felt no part in.	19.139196617203407
4249. he could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while	his body did these quick appalling and efficient things.	6.9328912004999195
4250. he	brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs.	7.615092762846159
4251. they	were carpeted but made for pumps and congress gaiters not the great	clodhoppers he wore.	5.846031738294962
4252. the sound of his footsteps was like a muffled	drum.	13.650212649167687
4253. at the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there	angrily in a dressing gown.	11.493189345474127
4254. he stopped and whispered his errand.	13.671139498061125
4255. young frederick seward held out his hand.	7.9231694401409145
4256. panting a little payne	shook his head.	9.670406878971576
4257. dr verdi had told him to deliver his package in	person.	7.035045418304147
4258. frederick seward said his father was sleeping and then	went through a pantomime at his father's door to prove the statement.	6.365727389270327
4259. i will go.	22.478711479519273
4260. he smiled	but now that he knew where the elder seward was he did not intend	to go.	9.983421400520195
4261. he pulled out his pistol and fired it.	9.492848836661834
4262. it	had misfired.	15.594944937291627
4263. reversing it he smashed the butt down on frederick	seward's head over and over again.	6.34397563857748
4264. it was the first blow	that was always difficult.	23.084776985865858
4265. after that violence was exultantly easy.	11.240731267247742
4266. he got caught up into it and became a different person.	12.201022148097422
4267. only afterwards	did an act like that become meaningless so that he would puzzle over	it for days whereas at the time it had seemed quite real.	7.3141439179175824
4268. the nigger boy fled down the stairs screaming murder.	9.945332631078985
4269. it was not murder at all.	21.054263613256005
4270. payne was more methodical than that.	9.670406878971576
4271. he	was merely clearing a way to what he had to do.	8.205145120615803
4272. he ran for the	sick room found his pistol was broken and threw it away.	8.821805502845221
4273. from childhood he had known all about knives.	8.480193090312076
4274. someone blocked	the door from inside.	10.875388345045687
4275. he smashed it in and tumbled into darkness.	9.026368296067464
4276. he saw only dimly moving figures but when he slashed them they yelled	and fled.	9.463855787733145
4277. he went for the bed jumped on it and struck where he could	repeatedly.	8.655702244747832
4278. it was like finally getting into one's own nightmares	to punish one's dreams.	12.732745132583446
4279. two men pulled him off.	12.550921923158377
4280. payne hacked at their arms.	10.472119682746735
4281. there was a lady there in	a nightdress.	18.376784842931034
4282. he would not have wanted to hurt a lady.	18.17954406401074
4283. another man	approached this one fully dressed.	8.508526361994372
4284. when the knife went into his chest	he went down at once.	10.835114532228467
4285. i'm mad shouted payne as	he ran out into the hall.	4.490463198111223
4286. i'm mad and only wished he had been.	5.047630932330972
4287. that would have made things so much easier.	11.240661203457739
4288. but he was not mad.	34.811325722539536
4289. he clattered down the stairs and out of	the door.	8.431773034471274
4290. somewhere in the fog the nigger boy was still yelling murder.	11.206849085016765
4291. one always wakes up even from one's own dreams.	8.334114692633642
4292. the clammy air	revived him.	15.841500723885778
4293. herold he saw had fled.	8.254441635698543
4294. well one did not expect	much of people like herold.	9.743109308228068
4295. he unhitched his horse walked	it away mounted and spurred it on.	7.560809233574742
4296. the nigger boy was close	behind him.	12.435529358277208
4297. then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone.	10.336231782713343
4298. he rode	on and on.	17.83289566254582
4299. he had no idea where he was.	13.630485904552046
4300. after some time he came to	an open field.	10.943899910931593
4301. an open field was better than a building that was for	sure so he dismounted turned off the horse and plunged through the	grass.	5.9704594273158795
4302. he felt curiously sleepy the world seemed far away;	he knew he should get to cap but he didn't know how.	7.482996763008458
4303. he was sure	for he had done as he was told hadn't he?	9.475118778056624
4304.  cap would find him	and take care of him.	11.901307652803261
4305. so choosing a good tree he clambered up into it	found a comfortable notch and curled up in it to sleep like the tousled	bear he was with his hands across his chest as though surfeited	with honey.	4.939594255353507
4306. violence always made him tired but he was not	frightened.	9.646563988429111
4307. in boston edwin booth was winding up a performance	of a new way to pay old debts.	6.87109644277198
4308. it was a part so familiar	to him that he did not bother to think about it any more.	13.346536586536633
4309. on a stage he always knew what to do and tonight to judge	by the applause he must be doing it better than usual.	6.896919497667492
4310. as	sir giles overreach	he raised his arm and declaimed: where	is my honour now?	7.391013650626644
4311.    that was one of the high spots of the	play.	17.354450061425553
4312. the audience as usual loved it.	14.819413009655081
4313. he was delighted to see them	so happy.	14.164517314845751
4314. if he had any worries it was only the small ones about	mother in new york and his daughter edwina and what she might be	doing at this hour with her aunt asia in philadelphia.	8.854689652844183
4315. everyone	is ambivalent about his profession if he has practised it long	enough but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all	those unseen people out there who might cheer you or boo you but that	was largely though not entirely up to you.	4.447559773878214
4316. they made the	world seem friendly somehow though he knew it was not.	9.51976510657041
4317. wilkes	was quite right about one thing.	7.622507342753323
4318. laura keene had been in the	green room.	10.995417055203664
4319. the commotion had brought her into the wings.	8.341215694113531
4320. since she	could not act one part suited her as well as any other and so she was	the first person to offer mr lincoln a glass of water holding	it	up to the box high above her head to miss harris who had asked for	it.	6.254812528859323
4321. she had been one of the first to collect her wits.	14.877653897481053
4322. it was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience as that	they had been stunned already.	13.469491209626954
4323. most of them had seen our american	cousin before and unless miss keene was on stage there was not	much to it.	7.756891696915041
4324. the theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom.	10.39073083885167
4325. the stage had been empty except for harry hawk doing his star	monologue.	7.171874422881686
4326. the audience was fond of harry hawk he was a dear	in or out of character but he was not particularly funny.	10.103913331683257
4327. at the end	of the monologue the audience would applaud.	10.787471775298716
4328. meanwhile it looked at	the scenery.	11.661784402967623
4329. well i guess i know enough to turn you inside	out you sockdologizing old mantrap! said trenchard otherwise	hawk.	5.827975751021583
4330. there was always a pause here before the next line.	14.698513644193772
4331. that was when the gun went off.	13.331625940041615
4332. yet even that explosion did not mean	much.	12.764634669356672
4333. guns were going off all over washington city these days because	of the celebrations and the theatre was not soundproof.	5.083242045036259
4334. then	the audience saw a small dim figure appear at the edge of the presidential	box.	9.103565732878423
4335. sic semper tyrannis it said mildly.	7.622507342753323
4336. booth	had delivered his line.	11.568363037656766
4337. behind him billowed a small pungent cloud	of smoke.	8.461409664010503
4338. they had not heard what had	been said.	16.301661874528456
4339. they had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily.	12.67734405918675
4340. the figure leapt from the box almost lost its balance the flag	draped there tore in the air the figure landed on its left leg fell	on its hands and pressed itself up.	6.580816606440294
4341. harry hawk still had his	arm raised towards the wings.	6.460370037324521
4342. he did not lower	his arm.	25.79198636437355
4343. the figure was so theatrically dressed that it was	as though	a character from some other play had blundered into this one.	5.679445260785294
4344. the	play for saturday night was to be a benefit performance of the octoroon.	9.061415632937646
4345. this figure looked like the slave dealer from that.	8.034217122783295
4346. but it	also looked like a toad hopping away from the light.	12.375741185773549
4347. there was something	maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them.	10.74114804890189
4348. then	it disappeared into the wings.	10.472119682746735
4349. harry hawk had not shifted	position but he at last lowered his arm.	5.825820622377272
4350. there was no mistaking that scream.	26.84798141185944
4351. it was what anyone who had ever	seen her had always expected her to do.	8.595594853566553
4352. yet this scream had a different	note in it.	11.639342299437809
4353. that absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them	awake like a pail of water.	6.829500528263492
4354. clara harris one of the guests	in the box stood up and demanded water.	8.736588363176713
4355. when something unexpected happened one always asked for water if	one were a woman brandy if one were a man.	5.919072275787562
4356. in the presidential box someone leaned over the	balustrade and yelled: he has shot the president!   that	got everybody up.	8.698599294234638
4357. on the stage harry hawk began to weep.	13.196836365206188
4358. laura	keene	brushed by him with the glass of water.	10.036828347283905
4359. the crowd began to move.	13.154520281004205
4360. in washington city everyone lived in a bubble of plots and one death	might attract another.	8.85425567561361
4361. it was not exactly panic they gave way to	but they could not just sit there.	9.58332939898048
4362. the beehive voices for no one could	bear silence drowned out the sound of mrs lincoln's weeping.	8.38835499036234
4363. at the rear of the auditorium upstairs some men tried to	push open the door to the box corridor.	8.140657718404771
4364. a	dr charles taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to	hoist him up to the box.	9.445244192180729
4365. in the audience a man named ferguson lost	his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob on the same principle	which had led miss harris to demand water.	6.783483221683582
4366. someone	opened the corridor door from the inside and called for a doctor.	9.33598880464964
4367. somehow	dr charles leale was forced through the mob and squeezed out	into the dingy corridor.	5.542917982132687
4368. he went straight to the presidential box.	17.80258989829216
4369. as usual mrs lincoln had lost her head but nobody blamed	her for doing so now.	6.874403735755864
4370. there was a little blood on the hem of her dress	for the assassin had slashed miss harris's companion major	rathbone with a knife.	9.509905277868208
4371. rathbone said he was bleeding to death.	8.575760172329272
4372. by	the look of him he wasn't that far gone.	8.196044167676531
4373. with a sneer the man spread his legs and a third time confronted them.	7.52442733790855
4374. once more katie reared and whinnied in fear.	12.637737377950167
4375. for a moment	boy and mount hung in midair.	10.319394769119684
4376. stevie twisted and frantically	commanded the mare to leap straight ahead.	7.879513779734377
4377. but the stranger was nimbler	still.	15.569511500738109
4378. with a bold arm he dared once more to obstruct them.	10.448714892209287
4379. katie	reared a third time then trembling descended.	7.14162538120728
4380. seizing the bridle he tugged with all his might and forced	katie to her knees.	7.729484273644453
4381. stevie could feel himself toppling.	8.254441635698543
4382. he saw the ground coming up- and the stranger's head.	12.095325978017666
4383. with	incredible ferocity he brought his fists together and struck.	6.460370037324521
4384. the blow	encountered silky hair and hard bone.	11.387658710676023
4385. the man uttered a weird cry	spun about and collapsed in the sand.	8.241030544309632
4386. katie scrambled to her	feet stevie agilely retaining his seat.	8.196044167676531
4387. again katie reared and now	wickedly he compelled her to bring her hooves down again and again	upon the sprawled figure of the stranger.	5.814661514546616
4388. he could feel his own feet	iron-shod striking repeatedly until the body was limp.	10.313156148466256
4389. he gloated	and his lips slavered.	12.127026643485452
4390. they rode	around and around to trample the figure into the sand.	9.33913350279515
4391. only the top	of the head with a spot bare and white as a clamshell remained visible.	6.582644781852289
4392. a train hooted.	17.62047525498602
4393. they were pursuing him.	15.935531557258523
4394. he was frightened; his fists	clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt.	11.186713371780234
4395. then katie stumbled	and again he was falling falling!   stevie! stevie!	his mother was nudging him but he was still falling.	6.164603411220565
4396. his head hung	over the boards of katie's stall; before it was sprawled the	mangled corpse of the bearded stranger.	7.664611883650454
4397. stevie wake up now!	we're nearly there.	7.622507342753323
4398. he was safe	in his mama's arms.	17.218119440805356
4399. houses winked	as the cars rolled beside a little depot.	6.460370037324521
4400. po' chavis! the	trainman	called.	13.148092146312546
4401. he came by and repeated po' chavis!	6	bong! bong! startled him awake.	8.030693619908224
4402. the room vibrated as	if a giant hand had rocked it.	10.087928513339124
4403. bong! a dull boom and a throbbing	echo.	7.14162538120728
4404. the walls bulged the floor trembled the windowpanes rattled.	9.945332631078985
4405. he stared at the far morning expecting a pendulum to swing across the	horizon.	7.362482252494495
4406. bong! he raced to the window and yanked at the sash.	7.615092762846159
4407. bong! the wood was old the paint alligatored.	6.764147616291221
4408. bong! a	fresh breeze saluted him.	10.472119682746735
4409. six o'clock!   he put his his	head out.	8.927507526111807
4410. there was the slate roof of the church; ivy climbed the	red brick walls like a green-scaled monster.	10.435005613338511
4411. the clock which had struck	presented an innocent face.	8.341215694113531
4412. in the kitchen mama was wiping	the cupboards.	18.61348947387476
4413. there's a tower and a steeple on the church	a million feet high.	3.708899010225001
4414. and the loudest clock in the whole world!	i know stephen she smiled.	11.77389984556819
4415. they say that our	steeple is one hundred and sixty-two feet high.	11.440144103059763
4416. the clock you heard strike-	it's really the town clock- was installed last april by	mrs shorter on her birthday.	7.333060553020843
4417. he dressed and sped outdoors.	12.127026643485452
4418. he crossed broome street to orange square.	12.411802052220429
4419. the steeple leaned	backward while the church advanced like a headless creature in a	long shapeless coat.	6.196120048044738
4420. the spire seemed to hold up the sky.	11.648656763221755
4421. port	jervis basking in the foothills was the city of god.	7.067437401480571
4422. the dutch	reformed church with two steeples and its own school was on main	street; the episcopal church was one block down sussex street;	the catholic saint mary's church with an even taller steeple	and a cross on top stood on ball street.	5.992156604378717
4423. the catholics had the	largest cemetery near the neversink river where main street ran south;	stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds.	5.482775642821309
4424. god	was everywhere in the belfry in the steeple in the clouds in the	trees and in the mountains hulking on the horizon.	7.262323928722576
4425. somewhere beyond	where shadows lurked must be the yawning pit of which papa preached	and the dreadful lake of fire.	6.100231395787658
4426. so walking in awe he became	familiar with god who resided chiefly in drew centennial church	with its high steeple and clock.	7.059373096202095
4427. there was no church like drew church	no preacher like papa who was intimate with him and could consign	sinners to hellfire.	7.972882750809799
4428. to know god he must follow in papa's	footsteps.	10.73717232809429
4429. he was fortunate and proud.	15.66991192537313
4430. the veterans idling	on their benches in the square beneath the soldiers' monument got	to	their feet when papa approached: morning reverend! his	being and his will- stevie could not divide god from his papa-	illumined every parish face turned the choir into a band of angels	and the pulpit into the tollgate to heaven.	6.23110200455709
4431. we have nine	hundred and eleven members in our charge mama announced and three	hundred and eighty sunday-school scholars.	6.942653137195679
4432. when papa	went out to do god's work stevie often accompanied him in the buggy	which was drawn by violet the new black mare.	8.090184270112296
4433. although they journeyed	westerly as far as germantown beyond the erie roundhouse and	the machine shop and along the delaware and hudson canal and northward	to brooklyn below point peter he could see the church spire	wherever he looked back.	5.762687993423129
4434. sometimes they went south and rolled past	the tollhouse- afternoon reverend!- and crossed the suspension	bridge to matamoras; that was pennsylvania.	7.158537503961423
4435. in the	delaware river three long islands were overgrown with greening trees	and underbrush.	7.415783281064617
4436. south of laurel grove cemetery and below the	junction of the neversink and the delaware was the tri-state rock	from which stevie could spy new jersey and pennsylvania as well	as new york simply by spinning around on his heel.	5.942605742410032
4437. on these	excursions papa instructed him on man's chief end which was his	duty to god and his own salvation.	6.678999984838132
4438. however a boy's lively eyes might	rove.	12.351749604539128
4439. where cuddleback brook purled into the neversink was a magnificent	swimming hole.	6.946964478735678
4440. papa pointed a scornful finger at the splashing	youth: idle recreation! stevie saw no idols; it troubled	him that he couldn't always see what papa saw.	6.09983039226678
4441. he was torn between	the excitement in the sun-inflamed waters and a little engine chugging	northward on the monticello branch.	6.898510631544483
4442. where you been	today?	17.983034337081474
4443.  ludie inquired every evening pretending that he did not	care.	7.750415063608092
4444. he'll make a preacher out of you!   no he	won't! stevie flared.	5.840521306149084
4445. not me!   somebody's	got to be a preacher in the family.	8.503504106516395
4446. he made a will and last testament	before we left paterson.	13.731421772300855
4447. i heard them! uncle and aunt howe were	the witnesses.	8.985226621592115
4448. will he die?	18.37766595309921
4449.    everybody	does.	15.610129252044759
4450. to speak of papa dying was	a sin.	11.56969976888144
4451. it could never happen as long as god was alert and the drew	steeple stood guard with its peaked lance.	7.928993338004826
4452. stevie was constantly	slipping into the church.	9.670406878971576
4453. he pulled with all his strength at the	heavy brass-bound door and shuffled along the wainscoted wall.	6.730386529531044
4454. the	cold mysterious presence of god was all around him.	8.196044167676531
4455. at the end of a	shaft of light the pews appeared to be broad stairs in a long dungeon.	10.633006088571898
4456. far away standing before a curtained window in the study room was	his father hands tucked under his coattails and staring into the dark	church.	7.001678528713207
4457. the figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence.	8.666078775279757
4458. the boy shuddered at the deathly pale countenance with its wrinkles	and gray hair.	8.759676372235512

4648.  who did?	23.885782126812085

4655. if i hafta do this to stay alive by god i'll do it.	9.037925621981648
4656. i	hated the goddamn army from the first day i got in anyhow.	10.433168243813688
4657. all pricks	like coughlin run it anyway one way or another.	8.16202614699969
4658. fuck them h he	rolled over and tried to shut out the noise now much louder.	7.648509000720696
4659. he snuggled	into the blanket h	brandon dreamed.	10.776005861178222
4660. he was sitting	on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water.	9.403693239510567
4661. a	river wide as the missouri where it ran by his place.	7.335779753157581
4662. but he was not.	34.49597796572316
4663. so what?	18.59128237484222
4664.  why should i be spinning just	because the goddamn log is spinning?	10.13070530556394
4665. 	.	15.610129252044759
4666. over on the bank	the west bank a man stood calling to him.	8.812537261954844
4667. he couldn't make out	what he was saying.	7.795963502794143
4668. no doubt it had to do with the log.	17.82477970845511
4669. why should	he be concerned?	12.299552866609114
4670. 	rousseau is so persuasive that voltaire is almost convinced that	he should burn his books too.	6.886249538313906
4671. but while the two men are riding into	the country where they are going to dinner they are attacked in	the dark of the forest by a band of thieves who strip them of everything	including most of their clothes.	5.948229664400545
4672. you must be a very learned	man says voltaire to one of the bandits.	20.171178207588326
4673. a learned	man?	17.297538600737344
4674.  the bandit laughs in his face.	12.435529358277208
4675. he goes to the chief himself.	15.732721694765026
4676. at what university did you	study?	17.524513425731964
4677.  he asks.	21.889553134177078
4678. he refuses to believe that the bandit chief never	attended a higher institution.	11.793252044639841
4679. to have become so corrupt he	says surely you must have studied many arts and sciences.	7.075792144112412
4680. the chief annoyed by these questions knocks voltaire down and shouts	at him that he not only never went to any school but never even	learned how to read.	6.896559938970077
4681. when finally the two bedraggled men reach	their friend's home voltaire's fears are once again aroused.	6.526302640247175
4682. for it is such a distinguished place with such fine works of art and	such a big library that there can be little doubt but that the owner	has become depraved by all this culture.	8.089153168043826
4683. to voltaire's surprise	however their host gives them fresh clothes to put on opens his	purse to lend them money and sits them down before a good dinner.	5.56944066851265
4684. immediately after dinner however rousseau asks for still another	favor.	9.011757208240255
4685. could he have pen and paper please?	8.261878609047885
4686.  he is in a hurry	to write another essay against culture.	16.763102424473505
4687. such was the impromptu	that voltaire gave to howls of laughter at sans souci and that was	soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of europe	to be printed sometime later but with the name of timon of athens	the famous misanthrope substituted for that of rousseau.	4.9157802803829505
4688. how cruel!   but at the same time how understandable.	18.027524893209772
4689. how could	the rich for whom life was made so simple ever understand the subterfuges	the lies the frauds the errors sins and even crimes to	which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages	the rich had in the race of life?	5.028920788314236
4690.    how for example	could a voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a rousseau	would find himself when soon after the furor of his first discourse	he acquired still another title to fame?	7.244973523943356
4691.    this time	as a musician.	12.995411607092887
4692. ever since he had first begun	to study music and to teach it rousseau had dreamed of piercing through	to fame as the result of a successful opera.	8.533781942407167
4693. but his facility in	this genre was not great.	10.424285828111833
4694. and his efforts to get a performance for his	gallant muses invariably failed.	11.065566490591841
4695. his	operatic music had little merit.	8.254441635698543
4696. but then one day while on a	week's visit to the country home of a retired swiss jeweler rousseau	amused the company with a few little melodies he had written to which	he attached no great importance.	7.800205407488597
4697. he was really amazed to discover	the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs.	7.3535919669018925
4698. put a few such songs together they urged him.	11.628774398523905
4699. string them	onto some sort of little plot and you'll have a delightful operetta.	6.257543042178702
4700. nonsense he said.	13.148092146312546
4701. this	is the sort of stuff i write and then throw away!   heaven	forbid! cried the ladies enchanted by his music.	6.336654291461924
4702. you	must make an opera out of this material.	10.017072377839973
4703. and they wouldn't	leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised.	8.602138872450183
4704. oh	the irony and the bitterness of it! that after all his years of effort	to become a composer he should now now when he was still stoutly	replying to the critics of his discourse on the arts and sciences	be so close to a success in music and have to reject it.	6.062264339481162
4705. or at least appear to reject it!   but what else could he do?	7.0146532207228125
4706. 	you couldn't on the one hand decry the arts and at the same time	practice them could you?	10.278409920367066
4707.  well yes perhaps in literature since	you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about your feelings against	literature and so were involved in spite of yourself.	5.60059243696532
4708. but now music	too?	28.39853014633006
4709.  no.	15.610129252044759
4710. that would be too much!   and the fault of	course was rameau's.	11.850944746886343
4711. the fault was rameau's and that of the whole	culture of this parisian age.	7.949663754035088
4712. for it was rameau's type of music	that he had been trying to write and that he couldn't write.	12.36600500163518
4713. these	little songs however were sweet nothings from the heart tender	memories of his childhood little melodies that anyone could hum and	that would make one want to weep.	4.777091308850867
4714. he couldn't appear	as a composer now.	10.649390503034523
4715. that glory craved for so long was now forbidden	to him.	7.7781193238568305
4716. still just for the ladies and just for this once for this	one weekend in the country he would make a little piece out of his	melodies.	7.650518612313837
4717. the ladies were delighted and jean jacques was applauded.	7.839212140222358
4718. and everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote.	8.889955146461821
4719. but then after the little operetta had been given its feeble	amateur rendering everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost	forever and that the royal academy of music must now have the manuscript	in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited.	6.231716108293974
4720. rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite standing	there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance.	7.492816382770513
4721. the ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him.	8.341215694113531
4722. a contradiction?	21.944778634142413
4723.  bah what was a contradiction in one's life?	7.083181512120244
4724. 	every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes	and saying yes when she meant no.	7.381174635157018
4725. rousseau had to admit that	though he couldn't agree to a public performance he would indeed	just for his own private satisfaction dearly love to know how his work	would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices.	4.897811242155384
4726. i'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people	seem to think he said.	8.462872112817319
4727. duclos the historian pointed	out to jean jacques that this was impossible.	6.8726567938239995
4728. the musicians of the	royal opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound.	8.513265273755152
4729. merely to satisfy the author's curiosity.	8.29907236975412
4730. but he recalled that rameau had once had a private performance	of his opera armide behind closed doors just for himself alone.	8.720039788987915
4731. duclos understood what was bothering rousseau: that the writer	of the prosopopoeia of fabricius should now become known as the	writer of an amusing little operetta.	4.808070905031883
4732. that would certainly be paradoxical.	16.51465128084808
4733. but duclos thought he saw a way out.	9.99670844734673
4734. let me do the	submitting to the royal academy he suggested.	10.77479865486041
4735. your name will	never appear.	10.488068255839314
4736. no one will even suspect that it is your work.	14.30958177424244
4737. to that rousseau could agree.	11.129123680875907
4738. but now what crazy twists	and turns of his emotions!   afraid at one and the same time	that his work might be turned down- which would be a blow to his pride	even though no one knew he was the author- and that the work would	be accepted and then that his violent feelings in the matter would	certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself.	7.900562692927515
4739. and	how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause! and thus torn	between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera	and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity	rousseau suffered through several painful weeks.	5.293431582904382
4740. all these	emotions were screwed up to new heights when after acceptance and	the first rehearsals there ensued such a buzz of excitement among parisian	music lovers that duclos had to come running to rousseau to	inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the king's	amusements and that he was now demanding that the work be offered	first at the royal summer palace of fontainebleau.	6.10524828558552
4741. imagine the honor	of it!   what was your answer?	8.18553935110075
4742.  jean jacques asked	striving to appear unimpressed.	12.431590691442471
4743. what else could i do?	11.591156920054853
4744.  monsieur de cury was incensed of course.	9.060328853487057
4745. but i said i would first have to get the author's permission.	13.610507212250583
4746. and i was certain he would refuse.	17.235246293149178
4747. how infuriating all	this was! why had not this success come to him before he had plunged	into his discourse and before he had committed himself to a life	of austerity and denial?	4.955389630163714
4748.  now when everything was opening up to	him- even the court of louis 15!- he had to play a role of	self-effacement.	8.272651517777078
4749. back and forth duclos had to go between m	de cury and jean jacques and between the duke d'aumont and jean	jacques again as his little operetta the village soothsayer	though still unperformed took on ever more importance.	5.227211832857009
4750. and	of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get	around among his closest friends.	6.808569519310805
4751. but they naturally kept his secret	well and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical	and court circles.	7.015249009362936
4752. how titillating it was to go among people	who did not know him as the composer but who talked in the most	glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first	rehearsals.	8.135915446994483
4753. the furor was such that people who could not possibly have	squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were	intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational.	8.461151369422783
4754. and	listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of	chocolate in a cafe rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration	trembling lest his authorship become known and at the same time dreaming	of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself	suddenly as the composer.	6.32719733088611
4755. he felt himself now as he himself	says in his confessions at a crucial point of his life.	6.607741319023334
4756. and that	was why on the day of the performance when a carriage from the royal	stables called to take him to the palace he did not bother to shave.	10.008590622866036
4757. on the contrary he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of	several days.	8.980433415237409
4758. seeing him in that condition and about to enter	the hall where the king the queen the whole royal family and all	the members of the highest aristocracy would be present grimm and the	abbe raynal and others tried to stop him.	6.097434206363047
4759. you can't	go in that way! they cried.	10.644218033232553
4760. why not?	23.24179106238561
4761.  jean jacques	asked.	18.68272446118427
4762. who is going to stop me?	20.544513394053585
4763.    you haven't dressed	for the occasion! they pointed out to him.	10.410372198890153
4764. i'm	dressed as i always am rousseau said.	9.060328853487057
4765. at home yes they argued.	12.498485635082105
4766. but here you are	in the palace.	14.306364280244424
4767. and madame de pompadour.	13.192167111495898
4768. if they are here then surely i have the right to be here	rousseau said.	14.396666965339293
4769. since i am the composer!	but in such a slovenly condition.	8.782024044526025
4770. what	is slovenly about me?	11.78959997873465
4771.  rousseau asked.	12.292407525564322
4772. is it because of my slovenliness	that hair grows on my face?	11.55506159839746
4773.  surely it would grow there	whether	i washed myself or not.	6.572783333480499
4774. a hundred years ago i would have worn	a beard with pride.	12.139134374908117
4775. and those without beards would have stood out as	not dressed for the occasion.	7.156917291557286
4776. now times have changed and i must pretend	that hair doesn't grow on my face.	8.405009070216412
4777. and	fashion is the real king here.	8.181297206969163
4778. not louis 15 since even he obeys.	11.606791343011063
4779. now if you don't mind i should like to hear my own piece performed.	5.725458603114982
4780. but of course behind his boldness he didn't feel bold	at all.	9.887008010130634
4781. he trembled lest his piece should fail.	9.783357976961607
4782. and this in addition	to his usual fear of being among people of high society.	9.859361814520655
4783. his fear	of making some inane or inappropriate remark.	7.591810951946381
4784. and even deeper than	that: his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to	relieve himself.	8.311536384923809
4785. could he walk out in the midst of his piece?	10.923668848968132
4786.  here	before the court?	13.148092146312546
4787.  before the king?	19.09659708171543
4788. 	it was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began.	10.195575129328692
4789. the rider from concord was as good as his word.	9.112598594729707
4790. he came spurring	and whooping down the road his horse kicking up clouds of dust	shouting:   they're a-coming! by god they're a-coming	they are!   we heard him before he ever showed and we	heard him yelling after he was out of sight.	6.960245054825023
4791. solomon chandler hadn't	misjudged the strength of his lungs not at all.	6.771690794857863
4792. i think you could	have heard him a mile away and he was bursting at every seam with	importance.	0.0
4793. i have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole	character of a man and when a very small man is up on a saddle he'd	like as not prefer to eat his meals there.	6.389333468030404
4794. that's understandable	and i appreciate the sentiment.	5.092274000697261
4795. as for this rider i never saw	him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted so whether he stood	tall or short in his shoes i can't say; but i do know that	he gave the day tone and distinction.	5.364940998037396
4796. the last thing in the world that	resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics	perched on top of a stone wall and this dashing rider made us feel	a good deal sharper and more alert to the situation.	7.496148529638275
4797. we came	down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us and we crouched behind	it.	9.564332874213168
4798. i have heard people talk with contempt about the british regulars	but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of	which they are deplorably ignorant.	7.942138480299418
4799. whatever we felt about the redcoats	we respected them in terms of their trade which was killing; and	i know that i myself was nauseated with apprehension and fear and	that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun.	5.191878549365918
4800. i wanted to wipe	my flint but i didn't dare to the state my hands were in just	as i didn't dare to do anything about the priming.	9.437068479917283
4801. the gun would	fire or not just as chance willed.	7.839212140222358
4802. i put a lot more trust in my two	legs than in the gun because the most important thing i had learned	about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it.	7.7479487019052895
4803. the gunfire which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the	road now stopped for long enough to count to twenty; and in that	brief	interval a redcoat officer came tearing down the road whipping	his horse fit to kill.	4.662152275130837
4804. i don't know whether he was after our rider	who had gone by a minute before or whether he was simply scouting conditions;	but when he passed us by a musket roared and he reared his	horse swung it around and began to whip it back in the direction	from which he had come.	5.627731404648714
4805. he was a fine and showy rider but his skill	was wasted on us.	8.833266063919373
4806. from above me and somewhere behind me a rifle cracked.	10.062957891703219
4807. the redcoat officer collapsed like a punctured bolster and the	horse reared and threw him from the saddle except that one booted foot	caught in the stirrup.	5.5340002578332745
4808. half crazed by the weight dragging the dust	and the heat the horse leaped our wall dashing out the rider's brains	against it and leaving him lying there among us- while the horse	crashed away through the brush.	5.977346198809271
4809. it was my initiation to war	and the insane symphony war plays; for what had happened on the common	was only terror and flight; but this grinning broken head not	ten feet away from me was the sharp definition of what my reality had	become.	5.870162264470024
4810. and now the redcoats were coming and the gunfire was	a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us.	11.525098327942652
4811. i must state	that the faster things happened the slower they happened; the passage	and rhythm of time changed and when i remember back to what happened	then each event is a separate and frozen incident.	5.209451043122457
4812. in my recollection	there was a long interval between the death of the officer and	the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoats and in that interval	the dust cloud over the road seems to hover indefinitely.	9.912810148882992
4813. yet	it could not have been more than a matter of seconds and then the front	of the british army came into view.	7.17038303590485
4814. it was only hours since	i had last seen them but they had changed and i had changed.	12.01864317339758
4815. in	the very front rank two men were wounded and staggered along trailing	blood behind them.	5.845739283149404
4816. no drummers here no pipers and the red coats	were covered with a fine film of dust.	8.499661309408816
4817. they marched with bayonets fixed	and as fixed on their faces was anger fear and torment.	6.376876511860498
4818. rank after	rank of them came down the road and the faces were all the same	and they walked in a sea of dust.	6.866166207286599
4819. committeemen hold your fire!	hold your fire! a voice called and what made it even more	terrible	and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant	only some of them glancing toward the stone wall from behind which	the voice came.	4.7678486809975436
4820. the front of their column had already passed	us when another officer came riding down the side of the road not	five paces from where we were.	10.643508450219572
4821. my cousin simmons carried a musket	but he had loaded it with bird shot and as the officer came opposite	him he rose up behind the wall and fired.	5.3057286192364455
4822. one moment there was a man	in the saddle; the next a headless horror on a horse that bolted through	the redcoat ranks and during the next second or two we all of	us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers.	6.4018988238656584
4823. one moment	the road was filled with disciplined troops marching four by four	with a purpose as implacable as death; the next a cloud of gun smoke	covered a screaming fury of sound out of which the redcoat soldiers	emerged with their bayonets and their cursing fury.	5.127737339337937
4824. in the course	of this they had fired on us; but i have no memory of that.	11.077854130819219
4825. i	had squeezed the trigger of my own gun and to my amazement it had	fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule;	and then i was adding my own voice to the crescendo of sound hurling	more vile language than i ever thought i knew sobbing and shouting	and aware that if i had passed water before it was not enough	for my pants were soaking wet.	4.986591467056598
4826. i would have stood there and died	there if left to myself but cousin simmons grabbed my arm in his	viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there; and then i came	to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that i	outdistanced cousin simmons by far.	6.582397244296734
4827. later	we realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall.	5.825820622377272
4828. their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching.	8.255467044782451
4829. we tumbled to a stop in deacon gordon's cow hole a low-lying	bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle.	5.625680356832002
4830. a dozen	cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane as perhaps	we were at that moment with the crazy excitement of our first encounter	the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road and the	thirst of some of the men which was so great that they waded into the	muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it.	7.016947042299251
4831. isaac pitt one of the	men from lincoln had taken a musket ball in his belly; and though	he had found the strength to run with us now he collapsed and lay on	the ground dying the reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow.	4.4785536941913415
4832. it may appear that we were cruel and callous but no one had time	to spend sympathizing with poor isaac- except the reverend.	8.84608635722705
4833. i know	that i myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn	open by a british musket ball as isaac had been yet i also felt	relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself.	6.160067010360587
4834. i was drunk	with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from	the road and the fact that i was not afraid now but only waiting	to know what to do next.	9.443855337734137
4835. meanwhile i reloaded my gun as the	other men were doing.	6.6556963805019675
4836. we were less than a quarter of a mile from the	road and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and	dust that hung over it.	8.494731728121307
4837. wherever you looked you saw committeemen	running across the meadows some away from the road some toward it some	parallel to it; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least	fifty militia were making their way in our direction.	5.092299006587666
4838. cousin	joshua and some others felt that we should march toward lexington	and take up new positions ahead of the slow-moving british column but	another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this	section of road.	6.4996323357149315
4839. i didn't offer any advice but i certainly did not	want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out.	5.161106379899632
4840. someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it	the british would be gone; but cousin simmons said he had watched	them marching west early in the morning and moving at a much brisker	pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass what with	the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts.	6.775591481307701
4841. while this was being discussed we saw the militia to the west	of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters of two and three	men as they approached the road.	4.9211996089918095
4842. it was the opinion of some of us that	these must be part of the committeemen who had been in the battle	of the north bridge which entitled them to a sort of veteran status	and we felt that if they employed this tactic it was likely enough	the best one.	10.318994078230466
4843. mattathias dover said:   it makes sense.	7.622507342753323
4844. if	we cluster together the redcoats can make an advantage out of it	but there's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of	us except chase us and we can outrun them.	0.0
4845. that settled it	and we broke into parties of two and three.	7.405179238426029
4846. cousin joshua dover	decided	to remain with the reverend and poor isaac pitt until life passed away-	and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world.	6.19151674490231
4847. i went off with cousin simmons who maintained that if he didn't	see to me he didn't know who would.	6.293692070088661
4848. good heavens adam	he said i thought one thing you'd have no trouble learning	is when to get out of a place.	9.455389687706633
4849. i learned that now	i said.	12.384361145835424
4850. we ran east for about half a mile before we turned back	to the road panting from the effort and soaked with sweat.	7.922509286317024
4851. there	was a clump of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road	and the shouting and gunfire never slackened.	5.84974187198564
4852. under the trees	there was a dead redcoat a young boy with a pasty white skin and	a face full of pimples who had taken a rifle ball directly between the	eyes.	7.344129227907071
4853. three men were around him.	9.635388815426408
4854. they had stripped him of his musket	and equipment and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off.	9.923759170517389
4855. cousin simmons grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away.	7.374745544769939
4856. god's name what are you to rob the dead with the fight	going on! cousin simmons roared.	6.08205208390664
4857. they tried to outface	him but joseph simmons was as wide as two average men and it would	have taken braver men than these were to outface him.	5.640020873681461
4858. that summer the gambling houses were closed despite the threats	of pierre ameaux a gaming-card manufacturer.	8.128089888922393
4859. dancing was no longer	permitted in the streets.	7.14162538120728
4860. the bordel and other places of prostitution	were emptied.	10.582206877639416
4861. the slit breeches had to go.	9.802060557618772
4862. drunkenness was no	longer tolerated.	11.568363037656766
4863. in defiance a chinless reprobate jake camaret	marched down the aisle in st peter's one sunday morning followed	by one of the women from the bordel whose dress and walk plainly	showed the lack of any shame.	6.068151461836031
4864. plunking themselves down on the front	bench they turned to smirk at those around them.	7.887778062155977
4865. john's first	impulse was to denounce their blasphemy.	7.14162538120728
4866. but the thought occurred	that god would want this opportunity used to tell them about him.	9.74388039454492
4867. calmly	he opened the bible and read of the woman at the well.	6.9847832933735505
4868. he finished	the worship service as if there had been no brazen attempt to dishonor	god and man.	9.522456647087683
4869. the next morning as the clock struck nine	he appeared at the council meeting in the town hall and insisted	that the couple would have to be punished if the church was to be respected.	7.461206861978431
4870. i have told you before and i tell you again monsieur	favre said rudely.	10.478240947770603
4871. stick to the preaching of the gospel!	john stiffened in anger.	7.0857818573654106
4872. that is the answer the ungodly	will always make when the church points its fingers at their sins.	10.131254810126318
4873. i say to you that the church will ever decry evil!   john's	reply was like a declaration of war.	9.02771332331282
4874. monsieur favre sat down	in his high-backed stall lips compressed eyes glinting.	7.615092762846159
4875. ablard corne	a short man with a rotunda of stomach rose.	6.993027508669045
4876. every eye was on him	as he began to speak.	10.416615337178504
4877. what master calvin says is true.	10.34648963827048
4878. how can we have a good city unless we respect morality?	13.649927469939893
4879.    abel	poupin a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes got to	his feet.	5.85218779008502
4880. we all know that jake camaret and the woman are brazenly	living together.	10.58140848094707
4881. it would be well to show the populace how we deal	with adulterers.	12.761171158372434
4882. philibert berthelier the son of the famous	patriot disagreed.	11.427520548518803
4883. do not listen to that frenchman.	13.383556130258755
4884. he is throttling	the liberty my father gave his life to win!   john	was quietly insistent.	9.98787421339557
4885. there can be no compromise when souls are	in jeopardy.	13.035341151591169
4886. a week later the sentence of the council was	carried out: jake camaret and the woman were marched naked through	the streets past a mocking populace.	7.155356829528243
4887. before them stalked the beadle	proclaiming as he went thus the council deals with those who break	its laws- adulterers thieves murderers and lewd persons.	5.50608875353189
4888. let	evildoers contemplate their ways and let every man beware!	john's thoughts raced painfully into the past as he read the letter	he had just received from his sister mary.	6.108385581947502
4889. charles had died two	weeks before in early november without being reconciled to the church.	5.899053563939885
4890. the canons in a body had tried to force him on his deathbed to	let them give him the last rites of the church but he had died still	proclaiming salvation by faith.	7.91810353009598
4891. burial had taken place at night in	the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet so that his enemies	could not find his body and have it dug up and burned.	4.67815023180371
4892. the abbot	of st eloi claude de mommor had been a good friend but not	even he thought charles deserved burial in hallowed ground.	7.28246350723244
4893. john	closed his eyes and saw once again the little niche in his mother's	bedroom where she had knelt to tell the good virgin of her needs.	5.194959005745815
4894. the blue-draped virgin was still there but no one knelt before her	now.	9.28052563372131
4895. not even varnessa; she too prayed only to god.	7.966666808519817
4896. for an	instant john longed for the sound of the bells of noyon-la-sainte	the touch of his mother's hand the lilt of charles's voice in the	square raftered rooms his father's bass tones rumbling to the canons	and the sight of the beloved bishop.	6.575337471081241
4897. but he had to follow the light.	21.056143465854127
4898. unless god expected a man to believe the holy scriptures why	had he given them to him?	0.0
4899. 	the white-clad trees stood like	specters in the february night.	6.460370037324521
4900. snow buried the streets and covered	the slanting rooftops as john trudged toward st peter's.	7.459599946858344
4901. a carriage	crunched by its dim lights filtering through the gloom.	7.6576209927635865
4902. the	sharp wind slapped at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow penetrated	the holes of his shoes his only ones now patched with folded parchment.	6.029236115155864
4903. the city had recently given him a small salary but it was not	enough to supply even necessities.	7.248227350434626
4904. as he neared the square a	round figure muffled in a long black cape whisked by.	10.295465922486509
4905. john recognized	ablard corne and called out a greeting.	7.53973992336163
4906. how grateful he was to such	men! there were several on the council who tried to live like christians.	8.94329027932402
4907. despite their efforts the problems seemed to grow graver	all the time.	6.863805642692483
4908. quickening his steps john entered the vast church and	climbed the tower steps to the bells.	6.886249538313906
4909. underneath the big one in the	silent moonlight lay a dead pigeon and on the smaller bell the clemence	two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold	winter air.	5.306309905832523
4910. john leaned upon the stone balustrade.	11.015816521655731
4911. he brushed	back his black hair shoving it under his pastor's cap to keep it	from blowing in his eyes.	6.034462242787552
4912. below the moon-splashed world rolled away	to insurmountable white peaks; above him the deep blue sky glittered	with stars.	7.407187179757351
4913. he stood very still his arms at his sides staring up	at the heavens then down at the blinking lights below.	6.324012135688302
4914. how	long my lord?	13.148092146312546
4915.  how long?	18.840450914418817
4916.  i have never asked for an easy task	but i am weary of the strife.	10.67299072670401
4917. sleep was difficult these days.	8.254441635698543
4918. severe headaches were frequent.	11.568363037656766
4919. loneliness	tore through him like a physical pain whenever he thought of peter	robert nerien nicholas cop martin bucer and even the compromising	louis du tillet.	5.6136407731091404
4920. an occasional traveler from italy brought	news of peter robert who was now distributing his bible among the	waldensian peasants.	7.03398687827998
4921. letters came regularly from nerien nicholas	and martin.	8.116668560739074
4922. he had anthony and william to confide in and consult.	11.878371347693164
4923. but william continued to find a bitter joy in smashing images and	tearing down symbols sacred to the old church.	6.869447331576674
4924. john found it difficult	but he held him in check.	9.059853435997004
4925. and anthony was busy most of the time	courting this girl and that.	8.023353947877137
4926. his easy good looks made him a favorite	with the ladies.	9.191578852464568
4927. geneva instead of becoming the city of god	as john had dreamed had in the two years since he had been there	continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished.	6.041300188027324
4928. refugees poured in signing the confession and rules in order to remain	and then disregarding them.	7.92723528821011
4929. dice rolled prostitutes plied their	trade thieves stole murderers stabbed and the ungodly blasphemed.	5.674295354649883
4930. catholics who were truly christians longed for the simple penance of	days gone by.	7.4607359217155285
4931. libertines recalled the heroism of the past and demanded:	are we going to allow the protestant pope master calvin	to curtail our liberty?	6.198626051315879
4932.  h why oh why doesn't he stick to preaching	the gospel instead of meddling in civic affairs politics	economics and social issues that are no concern of the church?	6.7657388148721935
4933. 	and john's reply was always the same: anything that affects	souls is the concern of the church! we will have righteousness!	tears burned behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated tonight.	5.058145268668881
4934. unless the confusion cleared he would not be coming here much	longer.	12.410037903963369
4935. monsieur favre's threat would become a reality for he continued	to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of that frenchman.	5.5860375166650975
4936. the slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming	up to the tower interrupted his reverie.	7.48837548295765
4937. faint at first the tapping	grew until it sounded loud against the wind.	6.143833267910102
4938. what is he doing here at this hour?	14.593712067860677
4939.  he started down the	steps to meet the near-blind preacher who had been one of the early gospelers	in paris.	9.008057201133907
4940. john?	19.804021762487697
4941.  is that you?	16.332208592714803
4942.  i came to warn	you of a plot!   john stood above him his face ashen.	11.005965261381508
4943. what	now?	15.610129252044759
4944.  slowly like a man grown old he took eli's hand and led	him below to the tower study guiding him to a chair beside the little	hearth where a fire still burned.	6.129230087746636
4945. monsieur favre just paid me a visit.	7.14162538120728
4946. i went to	your rooms and anthony told me you were here.	9.713745980661573
4947. two anabaptists caroli	and benoit are to challenge you and william to a debate before	the council.	5.924931599271709
4948. it is to be a trap.	44.21857856964294
4949. you know the law: if you lose the	debate after accepting a challenge you will be banished!	what will be the subject?	8.178154389223275
4950.    you are to be accused	of arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal.	12.603759436618347
4951. anger	and fear fused in john.	8.254441635698543
4952. ever since the fourth century a controversy	had raged over the person of christ.	9.947457250051057
4953. those who refused to believe	that he was the eternal son of god were termed arianists.	8.807995576376358
4954. peter	caroli had come to geneva saying that he had been a bishop of the	church of rome and had been persecuted in paris for his reformed faith.	7.959045446492952
4955. he asked to be appointed a preacher.	11.642040994070069
4956. but michael sept had unmasked	him revealing he had never been a bishop but was an anabaptist	afraid to state his faith because he knew john calvin had written	a book against their belief that the soul slept after death.	7.238430938804335
4957. so john	had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher and now caroli	sought revenge.	6.653679539858921
4958. if william agrees we should	insist on a public debate he said at length.	9.312330755359502
4959. there	is more to the conspiracy.	12.673352399316473
4960. bern demands that the lord's supper be	administered here as it used to be with unleavened bread.	8.303637849670915
4961. furthermore	bern decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the council	preach only the word of god and stop meddling in politics!	it was always the spirit with christ; matters such as leavened	or unleavened bread are inconsequential.	5.742177071614314
4962. geneva must remain a sovereign	state.	10.472119682746735
4963. we will not yield to the demands of bern!   the	firelight played over eli's flowing white locks and rugged features.	7.8483304833620515
4964. monsieur favre indicated that if i would co-operate after you	and william are banished following the debate i will be given a	place of influence.	7.324252069525804
4965. what was your reply to that?	12.321920802374585
4966. 	that i would rather be banished with two such christians than	be made the chief syndic!	the following morning as	john entered the place molard on his way to visit a sick refugee	he had a premonition of danger.	6.209813545001324
4967. then suddenly a group of men and dogs	circled him.	10.96217696981869
4968. he wanted to run but he knew that if he did he would	be lost.	15.96845763041831
4969. he stood very still his heart thumping wildly.	9.026368296067464
4970. on the outskirts	of the rabble the camaret brothers and gaspard favre shook their	fists.	10.30283763624519
4971. are you going to comply with the demands of bern?	10.809951669001064
4972. 	the chinless jake called.	11.568363037656766
4973. arianist! a rowdy with	a big blob of a nose roared.	6.210871206873012
4974. heretic!   john lifted	his hand for silence.	9.670406878971576
4975. know this: the ministers will not yield to	the demands of bern.	6.188065717221096
4976. his voice shook a little.	12.214555706636531
4977. for an instant john was stunned.	13.211460889763902
4978. when he felt	the side of his head his fingers came away covered with blood.	10.506357086597426
4979. before	he could duck another stone struck him.	7.14162538120728
4980. let	him be now! pierre ameaux the gaming-card manufacturer said	his little pig eyes glaring.	7.198778874655976
4981. we have taught him a lesson.	13.782733492933218
4982. the crowd moved back and john started dizzily down the hill.	10.071811434672382
4983. fists	pummeled him as he staggered forward.	7.622507342753323
4984. then he slipped and went	down on his hands and knees in the melting snow.	10.314683914062526
4985. at once a bevy of dogs	was snapping and snarling around him.	10.134539108736554
4986. one more horrible than the	rest lunged growling deep in his throat his hair bristling.	8.780343208698934
4987. with great	difficulty john clambered to his feet and started to run sweat	pouring down his face.	7.5813281788940765
4988. standing in the shelter of the tent- a rejected hospital tent	on which the rain now dripped no longer drumming- adam watched his	own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid	across two beef barrels.	5.7935816182702995
4989. there was of course no real need to rearrange	everything.	15.101407016425702
4990. a quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake or	the toffee or the barley sugar or the sardines or the bitters or	the condensed milk or the stationery or the needles- what could it	mean?	6.5303222870621465
4991.  adam watched his own hands make the caressing anxious movement	that when rain falls and nobody comes and ruin draws close like	a cat rubbing against the ankles has been the ritual of stall	vendors forever.	4.846964906484127
4992. he knew its meaning.	24.20490756521104
4993. he had seen a dry old yellowing hand reach out with that painful	solicitude to touch to rearrange to shift aimlessly some object	worth a pfennig.	5.9033645511443185
4994. back in bavaria he had seen that gesture and at	that sight his heart had always died within him.	7.4360790917581925
4995. on such occasions he	had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand whatever	face it might be.	7.640831529420232
4996. now the face was his own.	14.681641752805387
4997. he wondered what	expression as he made that gesture was on his face.	8.762610053091972
4998. he wondered if	it wore the old anxiety or the old taut stoicism.	9.176540466704445
4999. but there was no	need he remembered for his hand to reach out for his face to show	concern or stoicism.	8.34127931670501
5000. it was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came.	14.755697060910425
5001. then why was he assuming the role- the gesture and the suffering?	7.073318943553894
5002. 	what was he expiating?	11.568363037656766
5003.  or was he now taking the role- the gesture	and the suffering- because it was the only way to affirm his	history and identity in the torpid befogged loneliness of this land.	6.99264347017816
5004. he looked out of the tent at the	company street.	12.659622141254484
5005. the rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street.	7.43304005989246
5006. beyond that misty gray of the rain he saw the stretching hutment	low diminutive log cabins chinked with mud with doorways a man would	have to crouch to get through with roofs of tenting laid over boughs	or boards from hardtack boxes or fence rails with cranky chimneys	of sticks and dried mud.	5.8334355166905
5007. the chimney of the hut across from him was	surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked out.	5.902564164932943
5008. in this heavy air	however that device did not seem to help.	13.630721198091019
5009. the smoke from that chimney	rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other and hung as sadly in the	drizzle creeping back down along the sopping canvas of the roof.	5.037374730288671
5010. over the door was a board with large inept lettering: home	sweet home.	9.908431717123221
5011. this was the hut of simms purdew the hero.	11.080760197629639
5012. the men were huddled in those lairs.	16.470946965468556
5013. adam knew the names of some.	9.471812088714504
5014. he	knew the faces of all hairy or shaven old or young fat or thin suffering	or hardened sad or gay good or bad.	6.669341779662273
5015. when they stood about	his tent chaffing each other exchanging their obscenities cursing command	or weather he had studied their faces.	6.533980863879777
5016. he had had the need to	understand what life lurked behind the mask of flesh behind the oath	the banter the sadness.	8.087821645088608
5017. once covertly looking at simms purdew the	only man in the world whom he hated he had seen the heavy slack	bestubbled jaw open and close to emit the cruel obscene banter and had	seen the pale-blue eyes go watery with whisky and merriment and suddenly	he was not seeing the face of that vile creature.	5.0923071120457815
5018. he was seeing	somehow the face of a young boy the boy simms purdew must once	have been a boy with sorrel hair and blue eyes dancing with gaiety	and the boy mouth grinning trustfully among the freckles.	7.5271442601708705
5019. in that	moment of vision adam heard the voice within himself saying: i	must not hate him i must not hate him or i shall die.	5.518950930690354
5020. his	heart suddenly opened to joy.	10.472119682746735
5021. he thought that if once only	once he could talk with simms purdew something about his own life	and all life would be clear and simple.	5.899904888286583
5022. if simms purdew would turn	to him and say: adam you know when i was a boy it was a funny	thing happened.	9.387874475855426
5023. lemme tell you now-   if only simms	purdew could do that whatever the thing he remembered and told.	5.76954927577282
5024. it	would be a sign for the untellable and he adam would understand.	7.461352957445632
5025. now adam in the gray light of afternoon stared across at the	hut opposite his tent and thought of simms purdew lying in there	in the gloom snoring on his bunk with the fumes of whisky choking the	air.	4.772938250335397
5026. he saw the sign above the door of the hut: home sweet home.	10.556617361671215
5027. he saw the figure of a man in a poncho coming up the company street	with an armful of wood.	9.498572075447427
5028. it was pullen james the campmate	of simms purdew.	16.571667076119464
5029. he carried the wood carried the water did the	cooking cleaning and mending and occasionally got a kick in the butt	for his pains.	5.8545638669308735
5030. adam watched the moisture flow from the poncho.	8.845281039633662
5031. it	gave the rubberized fabric a dull gleam like metal.	6.460370037324521
5032. pullen james humbly	lowered his head pushed aside the hardtack-box door of the hut	and was gone from sight.	6.643215071337043
5033. adam stared at the door and remembered	that simms purdew had been awarded the medal of honor for gallantry	at antietam.	5.641685493630875
5034. the street was again empty.	17.51474267018452
5035. the drizzle was	slacking off now but the light was grayer.	7.9133653137009246
5036. with enormous interest	adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the	board directly before him.	7.525452723161261
5037. into the emptiness of the street and his	spirit moved a form.	7.364962063394607
5038. the form was swathed in an army blanket	much patched fastened at the neck with a cord.	9.297639536624093
5039. from under the shapeless	huddle of blanket the feet moved in the mud.	7.301555191280622
5040. the feet wore army	shoes in obvious disrepair.	11.387658710676023
5041. the head was wrapped in a turban and on	top of the turban rode a great hamper across which a piece of poncho	had been flung.	6.403606512061159
5042. the gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle.	9.945332631078985
5043. moisture ran down the cheeks gathered at the tip of the nose and at	the chin.	5.993936335927577
5044. the figure was close enough now for him to see the nose twitching	to dislodge the drop clinging there.	8.930715057032952
5045. the figure stopped and one	hand was perilously freed from the hamper to scratch the nose.	6.196120048044738
5046. then	the figure moved on.	11.568363037656766
5047. this was one of the irish women who had	built their own huts down near the river.	9.74890171885369
5048. adam recognized	this one.	13.848682165804604
5049. he recognized her because she was the one who in	a winter twilight on the edge of camp had once stopped him and reached	down her hand to touch his fly.	6.267062373353556
5050. slice o' mutton bhoy?	11.568363037656766
5051. 	she had queried in her soft guttural.	7.14162538120728
5052. slice o' mutton?	13.148092146312546
5053. 	her name was mollie.	9.118533821976325
5054. they called her mollie the mutton and laughed.	11.77345336631812
5055. looking down the street after her adam saw that she had again	stopped and again removed one hand from the basket.	5.72655906223824
5056. he could not make	out but he knew that again she was scratching her nose.	12.618923078955268
5057. mollie the	mutton was scratching her nose.	7.622507342753323
5058. the words ran crazily in his	head: mollie the mutton is scratching her nose in the rain.	8.02836027950596
5059. then the words fell into a pattern: mollie the mutton	is scratching her nose scratching her nose in the rain.	6.07178354905485
5060. mollie the	mutton is scratching her nose in the rain.	8.196044167676531
5061. the pattern would not stop.	12.048358905764905
5062. it came	again and again.	22.5434124636122
5063. he felt trapped in that pattern in the repetition.	9.40689200968235
5064. suddenly he thought he might weep.	13.276026947560865
5065. what's the matter with	me?	6.854133429398324
5066.  he demanded out loud.	17.83289566254582
5067. he looked wildly around at the now	empty street at the mud at the rain.	7.096282773390461
5068. oh what's the matter with	me?	12.392495127773664
5069.  he demanded.	21.889553134177078
5070. when he had stored his stock in the great	oak chest locked the two big hasps and secured the additional chain	tied the fly of the tent and picked up the cash box he moved up	the darkening street.	7.2661553560236385
5071. he would consign the cash box into the hands of	jed hawksworth then stand by while his employer checked the contents	and the list of items sold.	6.900322256837515
5072. then he-   then what?	15.455954797313815
5073.  he did	not know.	17.36673854574166
5074. his mind closed on that prospect as though fog had descended	to blot out a valley.	7.407049836017958
5075. far off in the dusk he heard voices	singing muffled but strong.	7.069973893844724
5076. in one of the huts a group of men were	huddled together singing.	21.57299960168739
5077. he heard	the words: rock of ages cleft for me let me	hide myself in thee! let the water and the blood from thy riven	side h   he thought: i am a jew from	bavaria.	5.928099705933186
5078. he was standing there he thought in virginia	in the thickening dusk in a costly greatcoat that had belonged to another	jew.	8.095433441926199
5079. that other jew a young man too had left that greatcoat	behind in a rich house and marched away.	6.526562245554576
5080. he had crossed the river which	now beyond the woods yonder was sliding darkly under the mist.	9.006802893817403
5081. he had plunged into the dark woods beyond.	10.918931351420587
5082. what had that man that other young jew felt as he stood in the twilight	and heard other men far away singing together?	6.9969182685210205
5083. .	15.610129252044759
5084. adam	thought of the hutments regiment after regiment row after row the	thousands of huts stretching away into the night.	6.54093796655646
5085. he thought of the	men the nameless thousands huddling in them.	9.258501717386936
5086. he thought of simms	purdew snoring on his bunk while pullen james crouched by the hearth	skirmishing an undershirt for lice and a wet log sizzled.	7.447523006120116
5087. he thought	of simms purdew who once had risen at the edge of a cornfield	a	maniacal scream on his lips and swung a clubbed musket like a flail	to beat down the swirl of rebel bayonets about him.	5.811186626421822
5088. he thought	of simms purdew rising up fearless in glory.	10.697093789223626
5089. he felt the sweetness	of pity flood through him veining his very flesh.	7.9058392470592445
5090. those men lying	in the huts they did not know.	11.24027507067006
5091. they did not know who they were or	know their own worth.	10.261513445302084
5092. in the pity for them his loneliness was gone.	13.277848599464294
5093. then he thought of aaron blaustein standing in his rich house	saying: god is tired of taking the blame.	7.463113341811992
5094. he is going to let	history take the blame for a while.	17.455747582760896
5095. he thought of the old	man laughing under the glitter of the great chandelier.	9.546184437199582
5096. he thought:	only in my heart can i make the world hang together.	11.418105465981181
5097. adam rose from the crouch necessary to enter the hut.	8.282808562358614
5098. he saw mose	squatting by the hearth breaking up hardtack into a pan.	9.651485716567786
5099. a pot was	boiling on the coals.	9.356345845066523
5100. done give ole buckra all his money?	9.060328853487057
5101. 	mose asked softly.	10.363724110347151
5102. and look what he done give us.	11.852011282115413
5103. adam looked	at the pot.	9.542287750099456
5104. what is it?	28.376061098518285
5105.  he asked.	21.889553134177078
5106. chicken mose	said and theatrically licked his lips.	9.060328853487057
5107. gre't big fat chicken	yeah.	9.118533821976325
5108. he licked his lips again.	15.385132030882776
5109. a chicken	with six tits and a tail lak a corkscrew.	7.190017756155806
5110. and hit squealed for	slop.	16.736438267237105
5111. fooled you huh?	10.363724110347151
5112.  it is the same ole same	tell me hit's name.	21.109468199709738
5113. it is sowbelly with tits on.	18.227047983051456
5114. it is salt po'k and skippers.	23.12401448405531
5115. that po'k it was so full of	skippers it would jump and run and not come when you say 'hoo-pig'.	5.829399153946358
5116. had to put my foot on it to hole it down while i cut it up fer	the lob-scuse.	7.200480242038305
5117. he dumped the pan of crumbled hardtack into	the boiling pot of lobscouse.	7.233226891479716
5118. good ole lob-scuse he mumbled	and stirred the pot.	9.530117963562256
5119. he stopped stirring and looked over his shoulder.	9.026368296067464
5120. know what ole buckra et tonight?	10.12242738290048
5121.  he demanded.	21.889553134177078
5122. know what	i had to fix fer ole him?	8.914423071152614
5123.    adam shook his head.	9.542287750099456
5124. she was a child too much a part of her environment too eager to grow	and learn and experience.	12.340414159482215
5125. once they were at easthampton for the summer	.	8.507536461383202
5126. one soft evening- that marvelous sea-blessed time when the	sun's departing warmth lingers and a smell of spume and wrack haunts	everything- amy had picked herself off the floor and begun to walk.	6.652447187035465
5127. fritzie was on the couch reading; laura was sitting in an easy chair	about eight feet away.	5.906441790702325
5128. the infant in white terry-cloth bathrobe	her face intense and purposeful had essayed a few wobbly steps toward	her father.	7.333060553020843
5129. y'all wanna walk- walk he said.	7.622507342753323
5130. then gently	he shoved her behind toward laura.	11.185419424362621
5131. amy walked- making it halfway	across the cottage floor.	6.764147616291221
5132. she lost not a second picking herself up	and continuing her pilgrimage to laura.	8.439284338716144
5133. then laura took her gently	and shoved her off again toward fritzie: amy did not laugh- this	was work concentration achievement.	5.622191507646579
5134. in a few minutes she was making	the ten-foot hike unaided; soon she was parading around the house	flaunting her new skill.	9.629758352109224
5135. some liar's logic a wisp of optimism	as fragile as the scent of tropical blossoms that came through the	window	consoled her for a moment.	5.685060977757118
5136. amy had to be safe had to	come back to them- if only to reap that share of life's experiences	that were her due if only to give her parents another chance to do	better by her.	6.743377812313719
5137. through the swathings of terror she jabbed deceit's	sharp point- amy would be reborn a new child with new parents	living under new circumstances.	5.6930906916443496
5138. the comfort was short-lived yet she	found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced	images on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion.	7.084558190949835
5139. gazing at her husband's drugged	body his chest rising and falling in mindless	rhythms she saw the grandeur of his fictional world that lush	garden from which he plucked flowers and herbs.	4.646432375121559
5140. she	admired him.	15.594944937291627
5141. in the darkness she saw him stirring.	13.759005181888769
5142. he seemed	to be muttering his voice surprisingly clear.	11.45143587764551
5143. y'all should	have	let me take that money out andrus said.	6.460370037324521
5144. 'nother minute	i'd have been fine.	10.472119682746735
5145. y'all	should have let me do it.	7.622507342753323
5146. yes i know fritzie.	14.895633550238912
5147. the heat intensified on tuesday.	11.828718914686771
5148. southern california gasped	and blinked under an autumn hot spell drier more enervating more	laden with man's contrived impurities than the worst days of the summer	past.	6.58556564347247
5149. it could continue this way hitting 106 and more in the valley	joe mcfeeley knew into october.	8.744089994028537
5150. he and irvin moll were sipping	coffee at the breakfast bar.	11.575118156690358
5151. both had been up since 7:00-	irv	on the early-morning watch mcfeeley unable to sleep during his four-hour	relief.	6.002354028006756
5152. the night before they had telephoned the andrus maid	selena masters and she had arrived early bursting her vigorous	presence into the silent house with an assurance that amused mcfeeley	and confounded moll.	7.1430550377799005
5153. the latter thanking her for the coffee had	winked and muttered sure 'nuff honey.	7.674701242703954
5154. selena was the wrong	woman for these crudities.	9.060328853487057
5155. with a hard eye she informed moll: don't	sure 'nuff me officer.	8.235993271533511
5156. i'm honey only to my husband	understand?	5.1153798896086915
5157.  sergeant moll understood.	10.821673271639995
5158. the maid was very	black and very energetic trim in a yellow pique uniform.	8.346523409839932
5159. her speech	was barren of southernisms; she was one of eliot sparling's neutralized	minorities adopting the rolling r's and constricted	vowels of los angeles.	6.18437172467544
5160. not seeing her dark intelligent face one	would have gauged the voice as that of a westwood village matron ten	years out of iowa.	8.2115006086085
5161. after she had served the detectives coffee and	toast	she settled down with a morning newspaper and began reading the stock	market quotations.	5.875809518663927
5162. while she was thus engaged mcfeeley questioned	her about her whereabouts the previous day any recollections she	had of people hanging around of overcurious delivery boys or repairmen	of strange cars cruising the neighborhood.	6.388860605232932
5163. she answered him precisely	missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports.	6.440940776014829
5164. selena	masters joe realized was her own woman.	9.060328853487057
5165. she was the only kind	of negro laura andrus would want around: independent unservile	probably charging double what ordinary maids did for housework- and	doubly efficient.	6.412725894930026
5166. when the parents emerged from the bedroom	a few minutes later the maid greeted them quietly.	9.836366055265124
5167. i'm awful sorry	about what's happened selena said.	4.0028807404405535
5168. maybe today'll be	a good-news day.	12.755029125254122
5169. she charged off to the bedrooms.	10.964089589888768
5170. moll	took his coffee	into the nursery.	10.472119682746735
5171. during the night a phone company technician	had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones.	7.732388892695747
5172. someone	would have to remain in the office continually.	10.139208619618195
5173. mcfeeley greeted	the parents then studied his notebook.	7.14162538120728
5174. he wanted to take the mother	to headquarters at once and start her on the mug file.	13.32150511003477
5175. andrus did not answer him.	8.254441635698543
5176. his face was	bloated with drugging redder than normal.	10.48840694128884
5177. the woman had the glassy	look of an invalid as if she had not slept at all.	6.040227447879625
5178. oh- we managed	she said.	11.568363037656766
5179. did anything happen during	the night?	10.052594241045202
5180.    few crank calls mcfeeley said.	12.123733999442909
5181. a	couple of tips we're running down- nothing promising.	6.764147616291221
5182. we can	expect more of the same.	16.85033608076364
5183. too bad your number is in the directory.	10.993861667567353
5184. didn't occur to me my child would be kidnaped when i had	it listed andrus muttered.	6.886249538313906
5185. he settled on the sofa with his coffee	warming his hands on the cup although the room was heavy with heat.	6.037038212650402
5186. the three had little to say to each other.	12.535135860942592
5187. the previous night's	horror- the absolute failure overcast with the intrusions of	the press had left them all with a wan sense of uselessness of play-acting.	5.259904251726102
5188. sipping their coffee discussing the weather the day's shopping	fritzie's commitments at the network	they avoided the radio the morning tv news show even	the front page of the santa luisa register resting on the kitchen	bar.	6.212589119890329
5189. kidnaper spurns ransom; amy still missing.	7.622507342753323
5190. once	andrus walked by it hastily scanned the bold black headline and	the five-column lead of the article	and muttered: we a buncha national celebrities.	6.221143152558621
5191. mcfeeley told the parents he would escort them to	police headquarters in a half hour.	0.0
5192. before that he wanted to talk to	the neighbors.	13.743706497443675
5193. he did not want to bring the andruses to the station	house too early- rheinholdt had summoned a press conference and he	didn't want them subjected to the reporters again.	7.360745376863581
5194. he could think	of nothing else to tell them: no assurances no hopeful hints at great	discoveries that day.	8.550953813276358
5195. when the detective left andrus phoned his	secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute	director for his current project.	6.138218890366432
5196. mrs andrus was talking to	the	maid arranging for her to come in every day instead of the four days	she now worked.	7.886402574074666
5197. outside only a handful of reporters remained.	9.76535815340183
5198. the bulk of the press corps was covering rheinholdt's conference.	14.420512925856121
5199. in contrast to the caravan of the previous night there were only	four cars parked across the street.	8.761836081824644
5200. two men he did not recognize were	sipping coffee and munching sweet rolls.	10.45153363022728
5201. he did not see sparling or	degroot or ringel or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed	him twelve hours ago.	7.810184369347594
5202. however the litter remained augmented by	several dozen lunchroom suppers.	11.339233381618946
5203. the street cleaner had not yet been	around.	10.105623985040385
5204. one of the reporters called to him: anything new	lieutenant?	18.20899694002796
5205.  and he ignored him skirting the parked cars and	walking up the path to the skopas house.	7.236657717809004
5206. when mcfeeley was halfway	to the door the proprietor emerged- a mountainous dark man his	head thick with resiny black hair his eyes like two of the black olives	he imported in boatloads.	6.883733920117719
5207. the master	of the house his nourished face unrevealing consented to postpone	his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective.	7.036470511133446
5208. inside	as soon as mr skopas had disclosed- in a hoarse whisper- the	detective's errand his family gathered in a huddle forming a mass	of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stood at one side of	a baroque fireplace.	5.751340321738221
5209. flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps they	seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait.	5.427950274147271
5210. it was amazing how	they had herded together for protection: an enormous matriarch in	a quilted silk wrapper rising from the breakfast table; a gross boy	in his teens shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands;	a girl in her twenties fat and sullen descending the marble	staircase;	then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor.	6.315374979741795
5211. they answered him in monosyllables nods occasionally muttering	in greek to one another awaiting the word from papa who restlessly	cracked his knuckles anxious to stuff himself into his white cadillac	and burst off to the freeway.	5.309717899005196
5212. no they hadn't seen anyone around;	no they didn't know the andrus family; yes they had read	about the case; yes they had let some reporters use their phone	but they would no longer.	6.009769395216417
5213. they offered no opinions volunteered nothing	betrayed no emotions.	8.729760093721831
5214. studying them mcfeeley could not help make	comparison with the andrus couple.	7.615092762846159
5215. the skopas people seemed to him	of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy.	5.902564164932943
5216. he imagined they were the kind whose tax returns were never examined	whose children had no	unhappy romances whose names never knew scandal.	7.7865651737678725
5217. the equation was	simple:	wealth brought them happiness and their united front to the world	was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had let	no one in on the secrets.	5.314023122311189
5218. by comparison fritzie and laura andrus	were quivering fledglings.	10.121671691894553
5219. they possessed no outer fortifications no	hard shells of confidence; they had enough difficulty getting from	day to day let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them.	5.234490859602089
5220. skopas	expressed no curiosity over the case offered no expression of sympathy	made no move to escort mcfeeley to the door.	6.44893033609597
5221. all four remained	impacted on the sofa until he had left.	7.423846201535696
5222. he had spoken to mrs	emerson the previous day.	14.497390660367909
5223. there remained a family named kahler	owners of a two-story tudor-style house on the south side of the andrus	home.	9.454829175845521
5224. their names had not come up in any discussions with laura	and he had no idea what they would be like.	7.845576408853676
5225. mcfeeley noted the immaculate	lawn and gardens: each blade of grass cropped bright and firm;	each shrub glazed with good health.	0.0
5226. the door was answered	by a slender man in his sixties- straight-backed somewhat clerical	in manner wearing rimless glasses.	8.040049783806193
5227. when joe identified himself he	nodded unsmiling and ushered him into a sedate living room.	6.733114303802984
5228. she had a dried-out quality- a gray lean woman	not unattractive.	11.612468342371175
5229. both were dressed rather formally.	10.532219129544442
5230. the man wore	a vest and a tie the woman had on a dark green dress and three strands	of pearls.	8.486784096251748
5231. funny thing mr kahler said when they	were seated when i heard you ringing i figured it was that guy	down the block hausman.	5.094729702350184
5232. kahler continued:	i fixed his dog the other day and i guess he's sore	so i expected him to come barging in.	6.670781892338829
5233. mr kahler went on to explain	how hausman's fox terrier had been making in his flower	beds.	6.782645742081112
5234. the dog refused to be scared off so kahler had purchased some	small firecrackers.	8.830811675761273
5235. he would lay in wait in the garage and when the	terrier came scratching around he'd let fly with a cherry bomb.	6.2248528988789795
5236. scared	the hell out of him kahler grinned.	9.060328853487057
5237. i hit him in the	ass once.	10.981588546931944
5238. both grinned at the detective.	12.461447959661996
5239. finally all i needed	was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked like a firecracker	and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life.	5.3929957457175774
5240. in the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room	and then they went across the hall to the kitchen.	8.083728859773203
5241. she was intimidated	by the stove.	13.578227809272471
5242. he found the pilot light and turned on one of the burners	for her.	11.488039783642373
5243. the gas flamed up two inches high.	9.409676561629903
5244. they found the teakettle	and put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox.	8.845103864548607
5245. several sections of a loaf of dark bread; butter; jam; a tiny	cake of ice.	5.986370078701823
5246. in their search for what turned out to be the right breakfast	china but the wrong table silver they opened every cupboard door	in the kitchen and pantry.	9.795031359275539
5247. while she was settling the teacart he went	back across the hall to their bedroom opened one of the suitcases	and took out powdered coffee and sugar.	5.643492815695885
5248. she appeared with the teacart	and he opened the windows.	10.090117903264954
5249. do you want to call eugene?	19.448997228014555
5250. 	he didn't but it was not really a question and so he	left the room walked down the hall to the front of the apartment hesitated	and then knocked lightly on the closed door of the study.	7.827583613581984
5251. le petit dejeuner harold said in	an accent that did credit to miss sloan his high-school french teacher.	5.27430904361069
5252. at the same time his voice betrayed uncertainty about their	being here and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable peace-loving	and dependable in everybody.	9.381513566955928
5253. since ordinary breakfast-table	conversation was impossible it was at least something that they were	able to offer eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it and the	plate of bread and butter and that eugene could return the pitcher	of hot milk to them handle first.	4.927496511835662
5254. eugene put a spoonful of powdered	coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water.	7.13692528752221
5255. stirring he	said: i am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with	you today.	5.427950274147271
5256. they assured him that they did not expect or	need to be entertained.	12.163987492420548
5257. harold put a teaspoonful of powdered coffee	in	his cup and filled it with hot water and then stirring he sat back	in his chair.	5.504334203671359
5258. every time he moved or said something	the chair creaked again.	9.229438789685036
5259. eugene was not entirely silent	or openly rude- unless asking harold to move to another chair and	placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act	of rudeness.	5.090312672718395
5260. it went right on creaking under his own considerable weight	and all it needed harold thought was for somebody to fling himself	back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it.	8.31994850246137
5261. through the open window they heard sounds below in the street: cartwheels	a tired horse's plodding step voices.	6.2992768691403285
5262. harold indicated the	photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was	in.	8.467623390152523
5263. eugene told him and he promptly forgot.	8.874022557322908
5264. they passed the marmalade	the bread the black-market butter back and forth.	9.33913350279515
5265. nothing was said	about hotels or train journeys.	8.167952129314486
5266. eugene offered harold his	car to use at any time he cared to and when this offer was not accepted	the armchair creaked.	7.3090349903079215
5267. they all three had another cup of coffee.	9.35655835491033
5268. eugene was in his pajamas and dressing gown and on his large feet he	wore yellow turkish slippers that turned up at the toes.	6.863434104428479
5269. ex-cuse	me he said in berlitz english and got up and left them	to bathe and dress.	5.9989820325607575
5270. the first shrill ring of the telephone brought	harold out into the hall.	11.818313687499009
5271. he realized that he had no idea where	the telephone was.	10.273340582565313
5272. at that moment the bathroom door flew open and	eugene came out with his face lathered for shaving and strode down	the hall tying the sash of his dressing gown as he went.	7.048726305549488
5273. the telephone	was in the study but the ringing came from the hall.	7.638222000087766
5274. between the telephone	and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord and when the	conversation came to an end eugene carried the instrument with him the	whole length of the apartment to his bathroom where it rang three	more times while he was shaving and in the tub.	6.548113439259515
5275. before he left the apartment	he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could	do for them.	7.269518003943447
5276. sabine called a few	minutes ago eugene said.	9.060328853487057
5277. she wants you and barbara to have	dinner with her tomorrow night.	7.187557404882245
5278. he handed harold a key to	the front door and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while	they were out of the apartment.	7.885770149095809
5279. when enough time had elapsed so	that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had	forgotten harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one	room after another.	5.458899937287409
5280. in the room next to theirs was a huge cradle of	mahogany ornately carved and decorated with gold leaf.	10.018658849260422
5281. it was the	most important-looking cradle he had ever seen.	13.211573438518776
5282. then came their bathroom	and then a bedroom that judging by the photographs on the walls	must belong to mme cestre.	7.735373041869249
5283. a young woman who looked like alix	with her two children.	8.085403915748241
5284. alix and eugene on their wedding day.	9.320030566117687
5285. matching	photographs in oval frames of mme bonenfant and an elderly man	who must be alix's grandfather.	5.427950274147271
5286. mme vienot considerably younger	and very different.	9.670406878971576
5287. and a gray-haired man whose	glance- direct lifelike and mildly accusing- was contradicted by	the gilt and black frame.	6.52492848885481
5288. it was the kind of frame that is only put	around the photograph of a dead person.	13.951590977898041
5289. professor cestre could it	be?	10.613370127107265
5290.    with the metal shutters closed the dining room was so dark	that it seemed still night in there.	9.48527397512265
5291. one of the drawing-room shutters	was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and sofas which	seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet.	7.381199158658839
5292. the curtains	were of the same material and there were some big oil paintings- portraits	in the style of lancret and boucher.	9.840786271336995
5293. though taken	individually the big rooms were or seemed to be square the apartment	as a whole formed a triangle.	6.415348747237091
5294. the apex the study where eugene slept	was light and bright and airy and cheerful.	8.086542342015262
5295. the window looked out	on the place redoute- it was the only window of the apartment that	did.	7.420507262043589
5296. looking around slowly he saw a marble fireplace a desk a low	bookcase of mahogany with criss-crossed brass wire instead of glass	panes in the doors.	6.589534341869777
5297. the daybed eugene had slept in made up now with	its dark-brown velours cover and pillows.	6.196120048044738
5298. the portable record player	with a pile of classical records beside it.	9.005093323721033
5299. beethoven's fifth was	the one on top.	7.622507342753323
5300. da-da-da-dum h music could not be eugene's passion.	9.826683783649258
5301. besides the records were dusty.	11.680702418728552
5302. he tried the doors of the bookcase.	13.660287845691446
5303. the titles he could read easily through the criss-crossed	wires: works on theology astral physics history biology political	science.	6.014161601545416
5304. he moved over to the desk and	stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything.	9.233222776045642
5305. the clock	on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced	at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room.	5.259904251726102
5306. the concierge called out to them as they were passing through	the foyer.	11.722677195483959
5307. her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building and	her small front room was clogged with heavy furniture- a big round	oak dining table and chairs a buffet with a row of unclaimed letters	inserted between the mirror and its frame.	5.32226222397224
5308. the suitcases had come	while they were out and had been put in their room the concierge said.	8.116645962814058
5309. he waited until they were inside the elevator and then said:	now what do we do?	7.108496227848375
5310.    call the vouillemont i	guess.	11.568363037656766
5311. rather than sit around waiting	for the suitcases to be delivered they had gone sight-seeing.	7.208421235855772
5312. they	went to the flea market expecting to find the treasures of europe	and found instead a duplication of that long double row of booths in	tours.	6.578151772633974
5313. cheap clothing and junk of every sort as far as the eye could	see.	7.2969249730940255
5314. looked at everything.	13.148092146312546
5315. barbara bought	some cotton aprons and harold bought shoestrings.	6.850114810505649
5316. they had lunch	at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection of two broad busy	unpicturesque streets and coming home they got lost in the metro;	it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should	have changed in order to take the line that went to the place redoute.	8.274874073994948
5317. it was the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of	his pocket and inserted it into the keyhole.	10.222759321247368
5318. when he opened the door	there stood eugene on his way out of the apartment.	15.860527135497628
5319. he was wearing	sneakers and shorts and an open-collared shirt and in his hand he carried	a little black bag.	8.064812262667377
5320. he did not explain where he was going and	they did not ask.	18.275418099846867
5321. instead they went on down the hall to their room.	9.645004737580726
5322. do you think he could be having an affair?	17.91698990227215
5323.  barbara asked	as they heard the front door close.	6.850114810505649
5324. oh no harold	said shocked.	16.62624163244733
5325. well this is france after all.	9.543751478423268
5326. i know but there must be some other explanation.	15.497876304622402
5327. he's probably	spending the evening with friends.	4.49173374683508
5328. and for that he needs	a little bag?	15.91836598929395
5329.    they went shopping in the neighborhood	and bought two loaves of bread with the ration coupons they had been given	in blois and some cheese and a dozen eggs and a bag of oranges	from a peddler in the place redoute- the first oranges they had	seen since they landed.	5.107784907847041
5330. they had vermouth sitting in front of a cafe.	19.100238431508604
5331. when they got home harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment	and thought how under different circumstances they might have	stayed on here in these old-fashioned high-ceilinged rooms that	reminded him of the irelands' apartment in the east eighties.	5.856514927169991
5332. they	could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days.	7.879513779734377
5333. he	went down the hall to eugene's bathroom to turn on the hot-water	heater and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming	trunks.	7.872453581240027
5334. they were damp.	24.88506539800004
5335. he reached out and felt the	bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub.	6.512874137333827
5336. he looked	around the room and then called out: come here quick?	10.088102719470992
5337. 	what is it?	10.363724110347151
5338.  barbara asked standing in the doorway.	10.863304370113585
5339. i've	solved the mystery of the little bag.	8.83616148316585
5340. there it is h and there	is what was in it.	12.55185082806886
5341. but where do people go swimming in paris?	10.78006460495349
5342. 	that boat in the river maybe.	9.670406878971576
5343. what boat?	20.454815948573874
5344.    there's	a big boat anchored near the place de la concorde with	a swimming pool in it- didn't you notice it?	6.172965591748858
5345.  but if he has time	to go swimming he had time to be with us.	11.344238112310036
5346. she looked at	him in surprise.	14.140224473190667
5347. i know he said reading her mind.	11.89674929739515
5348. i don't know what i'm going to do with you.	8.271741971299175
5349. it's	because we are in france he said and know so few people.	7.889110179042029
5350. so something like this matters more than it would at home.	9.707426532637717
5351. also	he was so nice when he was nice.	8.158698237499738
5352. all because i didn't	feel like dancing.	12.414000739217707
5353. i don't think it was that really.	5.920860785061621
5354. then what was it?	15.455954797313815
5355.    i don't know.	6.526837338842482
5356. the tweed coat maybe.	15.841500723885778
5357. the thing about eugene is that	he's very proud.	10.06956578582713
5358. and the thing about hurt feelings the	wet bathing suit pointed out is that the person who has them is not quite	the innocent party he believes himself to be.	7.485433503415122
5359. for instance- what	about all those people harold rhodes went toward unhesitatingly	as if this were the one moment they would ever have together their one	chance of knowing each other?	5.12664365853219
5360.    fortunately the embarrassing	questions raised by objects do not need to be answered or we would	all have to go sleep in the open fields.	7.7873584019551005
5361. and in any case answers may	clarify but they do not change anything.	13.602239219493752
5362. h he brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes of about a hundred	pounds' weight.	8.987604645453253
5363. they took jesus's body then and wrapped it	in winding-clothes with the spices; that is how the jews prepare a	body for burial.	5.603914417926407
5364. listed as present at the descent were mary	mary's sister mary magdalene john joseph of arimathea nicodemus.	7.098615518158965
5365. search as he might he could find no place where the bible	spoke of a moment when mary could have been alone with jesus.	6.0772301208256785
5366. mostly	the scene was crowded with mourners such as the dramatic dell'arca	lamentation in bologna where the grief-stricken spectators had	usurped mary's last poignant moment.	6.678663405801742
5367. in his concept there could	be no one else present.	10.079554328459578
5368. his first desire was to create a	mother and son alone in the universe.	8.62658440251439
5369. when might mary have had that	moment to hold her child on her lap?	6.972021845903633
5370.  perhaps after the soldiers had	laid him on the ground while joseph of arimathea was at pontius pilate's	asking for christ's body nicodemus was gathering his mixture	of myrrh and aloes and the others had gone home to mourn.	6.898309645271391
5371. those	who saw his finished pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses.	7.8801858256983905
5372. they would feel what mary was undergoing.	14.43875605464388
5373. there would be no	halos no angels.	19.03143900548589
5374. these would be two human beings whom god had chosen.	11.390756475190857
5375. he felt close to mary having spent so long concentrating	on the beginning of her journey.	8.067700364885134
5376. now she was intensely alive anguished;	her son was dead.	9.759860430032251
5377. even though he would later be resurrected	he was at this moment dead indeed the expression on his face reflecting	what he had gone through on the cross.	6.440429634158175
5378. in his sculpture therefore	it would not be possible for him to project anything of what jesus felt	for his mother; only what mary felt for her son.	8.110676966787103
5379. jesus' inert	body would be passive his eyes closed.	6.764147616291221
5380. mary would have to carry the	human communication.	13.565230929951191
5381. this seemed right to him.	11.309843967689007
5382. it was a relief	to shift in his mind to technical problems.	16.8528432339632
5383. since his christ was	to be life size how was mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship	seeming ungainly?	5.53830229619614
5384.  his mary would be slender of limb and	delicate of proportion yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely	and convincingly as she would a child.	6.342030298708218
5385. there was only one	way to accomplish this: by design by drawing diagrams and sketches	in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas	to carry his concept.	6.182877240283878
5386. he started by making free sketches to loosen	up his thinking so that images would appear on paper.	7.833904939808143
5387. visually	these approximated what he was feeling within himself.	7.592498988449206
5388. at the same time	he started walking the streets peering at the people passing or shopping	at the stalls storing up fresh impressions of what they looked	like how they moved.	8.623606416172686
5389. in particular he sought the gentle sweet-faced	nuns with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads	remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them	down on paper.	6.154848548060789
5390. discovering that draperies could be designed	to serve structural purposes he began a study of the anatomy of folds.	7.603585788601973
5391. he improvised as he went along completing a life-size clay figure	then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper wet the	lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that argiento	brought from the bank of the tiber to the consistency of thick	mud.	4.81948568511537
5392. no fold could be accidental each turn of the drapery had to serve	organically to cover the madonna's slender legs and feet so that	they would give substantive support to christ's body to intensify	her inner turmoil.	6.755295077078836
5393. when the cloth dried and stiffened he saw what	adjustments had to be made.	9.27439619267275
5394. so that's sculpture commented	argiento wryly when he had sluiced down the floor for a week making	mud pies.	9.460978068911757
5395. see argiento	if you control the way these folds are bunched like this or made to	flow you can enrich the body attitudes.	5.495391055031081
5396. they can have as much tactile	appeal as flesh and bone.	12.283548932381194
5397. he went into the jewish quarter	wanting to draw hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding	of how christ might have looked.	7.785657663326604
5398. the jewish section was	in trastevere near the tiber at the church of san francesco a ripa.	10.982712194047874
5399. the colony had been small until the spanish inquisition of 1492	drove many jews into rome.	6.468359563744081
5400. here for the most part they were well	treated as a reminder of the old testament heritage of christianity;	many of their gifted members were prominent in the vatican	as physicians musicians bankers.	8.720908756091038
5401. the men did not object to	his sketching them while they went about their work but no one could	be persuaded to come to his studio to pose.	6.561512335117621
5402. he was told to ask for	rabbi melzi at the synagogue on saturday afternoon.	10.107316701574787
5403. michelangelo found	the rabbi in the room of study a gentle old man with a white beard	and luminous grey eyes robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on	his head.	5.570936783263023
5404. he was reading from the talmud with a group of men from his	congregation.	13.014379671106212
5405. when michelangelo explained why he had come rabbi	melzi replied gravely:   the bible forbids us to bow down	to or to make graven images.	6.2715345199529136
5406. that is why our creative people give their	time to literature not to painting or sculpture.	10.88323326848201
5407. but	rabbi melzi you don't object to others creating works of art?	6.002446559592496
5408. 	not at all.	13.148092146312546
5409. each religion has its own tenets.	9.5754215067733
5410. i am carving a pieta from white carrara marble.	12.481657818979368
5411. i wish to make	jesus an authentic jew.	11.840884022727277
5412. i cannot accomplish this if you will not	help me.	14.818917960940539
5413. the rabbi said thoughtfully i would not want	my people to get in trouble with the church.	6.343866597148396
5414. i am working	for the cardinal of san dionigi.	13.534751508611084
5415. i'm sure he would approve.	4.560029137262479
5416. what kind of models would you prefer?	15.158697243657057
5417.    workmen.	15.610129252044759
5418. not bulky laborers but sinewy men.	12.699007652091959
5419. rabbi melzi smiled at	him with infinitely old but merry eyes.	6.210871206873012
5420. i will send you the best the quarter has to offer.	10.929353271176288
5421. michelangelo	hurried to sangallo's solitary bachelor room with his sketches	asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the	seated madonna.	5.0176589645046334
5422. sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle	couch.	8.581436094141479
5423. michelangelo bought some scrap lumber.	8.562951707179929
5424. together he and argiento	built the stand covering it with blankets.	9.389948731392575
5425. his first	model arrived at dusk.	9.627882438407596
5426. he hesitated for a moment when michelangelo asked	him to disrobe so michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to	wrap around his loins led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes.	9.638544507749977
5427. he then draped him over the rough stand explained that he was supposed	to be recently dead and was being held on his mother's lap.	6.720961242342408
5428. the	model quite plainly thought michelangelo crazy; only the instructions	from his rabbi kept him from bolting.	6.886249538313906
5429. but at the end of the sitting	when michelangelo showed him the quick free drawings with the	mother roughed in holding her son the model grasped what michelangelo	was after and promised to speak to his friends h.	7.317185085116887
5430. he worked for	two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi.	0.0
5431. mary presented	quite a different problem.	9.285946786453083
5432. though this sculpture must take place	thirty-three	years after her moment of decision he could not conceive	of her as a woman in her mid-fifties old wrinkled broken in body and	face by labor or worry.	6.830882317439205
5433. his image of the virgin had always been that	of a young woman even as had his memory of his mother.	5.961152921714031
5434. jacopo	galli introduced him into several roman homes.	9.060328853487057
5435. here he sketched	sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk young girls not yet	twenty some about to be married some married a year or two.	6.0608700302390845
5436. since	the santo spirito hospital had taken only men he had had no experience	in the study of female anatomy; but he had sketched the women of	tuscany in their fields and homes.	7.427478530294428
5437. he was able to discern the body	lines of the roman women under their robes.	9.19578727453928
5438. he spent concentrated	weeks putting his two figures together: a mary who would be young	and sensitive yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap; and	a jesus who though lean was strong even in death h a look he remembered	well from his experience in the dead room of santo spirito.	6.458749664096356
5439. he drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory	without need to consult his sketches.	6.3332044950364645
5440. soon he was ready	to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay.	9.61542276447901
5441. here he would have free	expression because the material could be moved to distort forms.	8.097344848658365
5442. when	he wanted to emphasize or get greater intensity he added or subtracted	clay.	7.461352957445632
5443. next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of	wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence.	6.5178560548700215
5444. he respected each	of these approach techniques and kept them in character: his quill	drawings had a scratchiness suggesting skin texture; the clay he used	plastically to suggest soft moving flesh as in an abdomen in a reclining	torso; the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an	elastic pull.	6.122394760951571
5445. yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his	mind; they remained rough starting points.	6.270423813705957
5446. when carving he was charged	with spontaneous energy; too careful or detailed studies in clay	and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model.	7.03750947618792
5447. the true surge had to be inside the marble itself.	8.998770308186435
5448. drawing and	models were his thinking.	10.472119682746735
5449. the arrangement	with argiento was working well except that sometimes michelangelo	could not figure who was master and who apprentice.	5.780140237098333
5450. argiento had	been trained so rigorously by the jesuits that michelangelo was unable	to change his habits: up before dawn to scrub the floors whether	they were dirty or not; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry	every day the pots scoured with river sand after each meal.	5.465985517666067
5451. argiento this is senseless he complained not liking to work	on the wet floors particularly in cold weather.	5.236383152695367
5452. scrub the studio once a week.	9.670406878971576
5453. before dawn.	18.50048355942429
5454. and god help anyone who tries to unteach you!	grumbled michelangelo; yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble	about for argiento made few demands on him.	8.67278508006772
5455. the boy was becoming acquainted	with the contadini families that brought produce into rome.	6.90464199729814
5456. on sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with	them and in particular to see their horses.	8.23501377061213
5457. the one thing he missed	from his farm in the po valley was the animals; frequently he would	take his leave of michelangelo by announcing:   today	i go see the horses.	5.823909298585406
5458. it took a piece of bad luck to show	michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him.	12.042362002263301
5459. he was crouched over his	anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim when a splinter	of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil.	5.677460923252987
5460. he stumbled	into the house eyes burning like fire.	11.45143587764551
5461. argiento made him lie	down on the bed brought a pan of hot water dipped some clean white linen	cloth and applied it to extract the splinter.	5.1643423832701085
5462. though the pain was	considerable michelangelo was not too concerned.	11.4273298310426
5463. he assumed he could	blink the splinter out.	10.362409917895468
5464. but it would not come.	43.67703722033909
5465. argiento never left	his side keeping the water boiled applying hot compresses throughout	the night.	5.674295354649883
5466. by the second day michelangelo began to worry;	and by the second night he was in a state of panic: he could see nothing	out of the afflicted eye.	9.277430225336678
5467. at dawn argiento went to jacopo galli.	10.027868570518072
5468. galli arrived with his family surgeon maestro lippi.	8.581436094141479
5469. the surgeon	carried a cage of live pigeons.	8.976097203071156
5470. he told argiento to take a bird	out of the cage cut a large vein under its wing let the blood gush	into michelangelo's injured eye.	7.810921632123888
5471. the surgeon came back at	dusk cut the vein of a second pigeon again washed out the eye.	6.325448302970279
5472. beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps.	7.391013650626644
5473. the thin legs twitched convulsively once then kate felt the little	body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound.	5.571976520698639
5474. the scant	flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands.	10.582206877639416
5475. when juanita awoke kate was still rocking the dead child still	crooning in disbelief no no oh no!   they put	kate to bed and wired jonathan and sent for the young presbyterian	minister.	5.190080516142122
5476. he sat beside kate's bed with the others throughout the	morning talking talking of god's will while kate lay staring angrily	at him.	7.737894978563803
5477. when he told her god had called the child to him she	rejected his words rebelliously.	7.5074298567114255
5478. few of the neighbors came but	mrs tussle came called by tragedy.	9.59290661441379
5479. it always comes in	threes she sighed heavily.	11.601728556192805
5480. trouble never comes but in threes.	11.108380474026662
5481. they held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads	church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot.	5.905871111394986
5482. kate moved	through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment.	8.797671804231028
5483. she would not accept the death of such a little child.	10.945443195036063
5484. god called	her to him the minister had said.	10.261126987147541
5485. god would not do that	kate thought stubbornly.	8.679403727470644
5486. jonathan's letter came as she knew	it would and he had accepted their child's death as another judgment	from god against both kate and himself.	6.656468589764589
5487. in blind panic of grief	she accepted jonathan's dictum and believed in her desperation that	she had been cursed by god.	6.012361463777105
5488. she held jonathan's letter his words	burning like a brand and knew suddenly that the bonds between them	were severed.	7.526481911161834
5489. she had nothing left but her duty to his land and his	son.	7.79081837780472
5490. joel came and sat mutely with her sharing her pain and anguish	averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom.	6.290129093830134
5491. juanita and	mrs tussle kept kate in bed a week until her milk dried.	5.819916787989497
5492. when	she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion	save dedication to duty.	8.108700813323747
5493. she disciplined herself daily to do what	must be done.	7.953336273174813
5494. she had even steeled herself to keep juanita upstairs	in the nurse's room off the empty nursery although the girl tried	to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare kate remembrance of	the baby's death.	6.943700471097851
5495. juanita drooped about the place wearing	a haunted brooding look which kate attributed to the baby's death	until the day a letter came for her addressed to miss juanita fitzroy	bearing a grafton postmark.	4.828546067467191
5496. seeing the slanting hand kate	knew uneasily that it was from the yankee colonel.	9.81743385482403

5665. the wraith-like events of the last few days flooded david's	mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his	kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from boston.	6.011252710698994

5672. he hoped he was free of self-deception.	13.22850795736197
5673. here he was suddenly	caught up in the delirium of a war in the spite and calumny of whigs	and tories.	7.308781708847473

5676. he knew that many were	using it for their own ends.	15.319612802335438
5677. but it did not matter.	31.684433019798956
5678. he stropped the	razor slowly; what mattered was that a new concept of americans was	being born.	8.593806987947758
5679. that some men did not want it he could understand.	8.336944280732
5680. the	moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers.	7.615092762846159

5685. and what of that poor tarred	and feathered wretch he had seen on the road driving down from schuyler's?	7.480221432026576
5686. 	things like that would increase rather than be done away	with.	8.11890220056154

5702. he began to pack the saddlebags.	21.422066580561875
5703. and all this too shall pass	away: it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church	service when he was a boy- yes in a white church with a thin spur	steeple in the patriarchal hudson valley where a feeling of plenitude	was normal in those english-dutch manors with their well-fed squires.	5.329847904628258
5704. burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried on	in a primitive way almost unchanged from feudal times.	6.365727389270327

5709. andrei remembered that his own reaction	had been one of indifference.	6.787403073327353
5710. had he found the meaning too	late?	11.946258255486631
5711.  it aggravated him.	22.215501758012252
5712. the land of the lublin uplands was rich	but no one seemed to care.	10.94526327761936

5714. he had	sat beside alexander brandel at the rostrum of a congress of zionists.	8.824820353737188
5715. all of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified	ideologies and each berated the other and beat his breast for	his own approaches.	6.948416117952861
5716. when alexander brandel rose to speak the hall	became silent.	11.138509861638617
5717. i do not care if your beliefs take you along	a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism.	6.951274890181028
5718. we are	here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest	seeking human dignity.	8.012847557110435
5719. beyond the forest all our paths merge into	a single great highway which ends in the barren eroded hills of judea.	5.301317329240338
5720. this is our singular goal.	25.412908806455967
5721. how we travel through the forest is for	each man's conscience.	7.458181639771552
5722. where we end our journey is always the same.	10.07138260355431
5723. we all seek the same thing through different ways- an end to this	long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses	which will continue to plague us until the star of david flies over	zion.	6.037374907637478
5724. this was how alexander brandel expressed pure zionism.	13.137217118431877

5728. before he went into battle andrei had told alex i	only want to be a pole.	11.141313029717725
5729. warsaw is my city not tel aviv.	7.14162538120728
5730. and now andrei sat on a train on the way to lublin and wondered	if he was not being punished for his lack of belief.	10.069873576473157
5731. warsaw! he	saw the smug eyes of the home army chief roman and all the	romans and	the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him.	5.721212256728581
5732. they had let	this black hole of death in warsaw's heart exist without a cry of	protest.	9.521813639338504

5742. 	what is beyond this fog?	10.472119682746735
5743.  only palestine and i will never live to	see palestine because i did not believe.	7.7293072626358885
5744. by late afternoon	the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at lublin	which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war	to the russian front.	6.518716138816649
5745. at a siding another train which was a	familiar sight these days.	8.677572294524834

5853. i don't know if i can get you into the inner camp.	4.772737124156635
5854. maybe yes maybe no but you can observe everything from the roof	of a barrack we are building.	7.587034009540522
5855. grabski slurped his way to the	bottom of the soup bowl.	8.106383367865853
5856. can't understand why the hell anyone	wants to go inside that son-of-a-bitch place.	7.808140422337925
5857. orders from	the home army.	9.118533821976325
5858. why?	19.804021762487697
5859.  nothing there but jews.	10.967551345999263
5860. well-	what about the money?	11.568363037656766
5861.    andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty	notes.	8.254441635698543
5862. grabski had never seen so much money.	10.326051719142223
5863. his broad flat	fingers petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying snatched	the bills clumsily.	6.2700032503171785
5864. you	get the rest when i'm safely out of majdanek.	8.93045837200534
5865. i ain't	taking no goddamned chances for no jew business.	8.555241096529764
5866. andrei	and styka were silent.	11.568363037656766
5867. she was getting real dramatic.	13.578227809272471
5868. i'd have been more impressed	if i hadn't remembered that she'd played hedda gabler in her	highschool dramatics course.	5.531780034684722
5869. i didn't want her back on that broken	record.	6.2581366027262275
5870. nothing's free in the whole goddam world was	all i could think of to say.	7.509170309051386
5871. when i'd delivered myself of that	gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink.	7.019472964292951
5872. i'd forgotten all about thelma and the kentucky	derby and how it was thelma's fifty dollars i was spending.	5.4921307270326984
5873. it was just me and eileen getting drunk together like we used to in	the old days and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my	hands on her partly because i wanted to wring her neck because she was	so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch.	5.0605963081035314
5874. drunk	or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me.	11.248667974342622
5875. i was	crazy about her all over again.	9.95288923829895
5876. it was the call of the wild all right.	17.54121672084635
5877. that evening turned out to be hell like all the others.	10.352638715720124
5878. we	moved down broadway from ginmill to ginmill.	9.060328853487057
5879. it was the same old routine.	20.496981201812435
5880. eileen got to dancing just a little tiny dancing step to a hummed	tune that you could hardly notice and trying to pick up strange	men but each time i was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she'd	pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet	husky voice about the good times and the happiness we'd had together	and there i was back on the hook.	5.940524929074068
5881. i did have the decency to	call up thelma and tell her i'd met old friends and would be home	late.	6.327900220295112
5882. i could scratch her eyes out eileen cried and stamped	her foot when i came back from the phone booth.	9.525284433384837
5883. you know i	don't like my men to have other women.	10.454897741501911
5884. i hate it.	23.01211864307504
5885. she got so drunk i had to take her home.	9.280642825564364
5886. it was a walk up on	hudson street.	21.735874734770118
5887. she just about made me carry her upstairs and then	she clung to me and wouldn't let me go.	6.052569241866805
5888. there was a man's	jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table.	15.046933679330468
5889. the place smelt of	some kind of hair lotion these pimplike characters use.	7.244396365881352
5890. what about	ballestre?	25.95030532115391
5891.  i had to shake her to make her listen.	12.526088950355705
5892. what about him?	20.3435750720723
5893.    suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic.	8.656836902049417
5894. precious and i allow each other absolute freedom.	8.581436094141479
5895. we are	above being jealous.	13.960988065955103
5896. he's used to me bringing home strange men.	5.140975414125697
5897. i'll	just tell him you're my husband.	7.622507342753323
5898. he can't object to that.	15.385132030882776
5899. if he pokes his nose in here i'll slug	him.	10.531459175595769
5900. that really would be funny.	14.860954966088402
5901. she was still laughing when i grabbed her and started rolling	her on the bed.	7.401771410541008
5902. after all i'm made of flesh and blood.	13.028278206784922
5903. i'm	not a plaster saint.	9.118533821976325
5904. never in my life	have i felt so remorseful about anything i've done as i did about	spending that night with my own wife.	6.641408854661527
5905. eileen declared she couldn't lift her head from the pillow.	6.278469055508673
5906. she	lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling	me where to look for the coffeepot.	7.289050266557726
5907. i was stumbling in my undershirt	trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when i smelt that	sickish sweet hairtonic smell.	6.170237689804208
5908. there was somebody else in the apartment.	24.413715865229516
5909. honest i could feel the hair stand up on the	back of my neck like a dog's that is going to get into a fight.	6.1045968043584224
5910. i	turned around with the percolator in my hand.	10.036828347283905
5911. my eyes were so bleary	i could barely see him but there he was a little smooth olivefaced	guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora.	5.604160986579163
5912. oval face without an expression in the world.	10.286620937605248
5913. we didn't have time to speak before eileen's voice was screeching	at us from the bed.	7.209115659667673
5914. joseph maria ballestre meet francis xavier	bowman.	9.839283266130659
5915. she gave the nastiest laugh	i ever heard.	11.36372124108146
5916. and don't either of you forget that i'm not	any man's property.	9.27293326867462
5917. if you want to fight go down on the sidewalk.	16.983977359301335
5918. she was enjoying the situation.	17.22621989152487
5919. eileen	was a psychologist all right.	8.254441635698543
5920. instead of wanting to sock the poor bastard	i found myself having a fellowfeeling for him.	9.518069777553453
5921. maybe he felt the	same way.	12.42556484973851
5922. i never felt such a lowdown hound in my life.	11.085869812615156
5923. first thing	i knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and i was	handing eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a	queen among her courtiers.	6.053580006699366
5924. i couldn't face thelma after that	night.	13.93195501835056
5925. i didn't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone.	6.437211482415965
5926. i wrote her that i'd met up with eileen and that old bonds had proved	too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express.	6.9947458058587255
5927. of	course i had to give her eileen's address but she never came near	us.	6.890018465612133
5928. all she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was	beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and	it was goodbye forever.	6.533160722314124
5929. she never said a word about the fifty dollars.	10.185364427851217
5930. she added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking.	10.889707593222452
5931. i	must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times.	6.631136575431331
5932. afterwards i learned that eileen had called thelma on the telephone	and made a big scene about thelma trying to take her husband	away.	6.492041248069093
5933. that finished me with thelma.	12.118043906724294
5934. trust eileen to squeeze all the	drama out of a situation.	8.900025743948065
5935. and there i was shacked up with eileen	in that filthy fourth floor attic on hudson street.	7.392903302898851
5936. i use the	phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about	our relationship.	9.285570187987327
5937. i felt it and it ate on me all the time but i	didn't know how right i was till later.	7.539165244226309
5938. what i did know was	that precious was always around.	12.226368631598916
5939. he slept in the hall bedroom at the	head of the stairs.	7.560809233574742
5940. who do you think pays the rent?	13.47412973965653
5941.  you wouldn't	have me throw the poor boy out on the street eileen said when	i needled her about it.	7.336542862642047
5942. i said sure that was what i wanted her	to do but she paid no attention.	8.698147371036596
5943. eileen had a wonderful way of not listening	to things she didn't want to hear.	5.589783253570319
5944. still i didn't think	she was twotiming me with precious right then.	8.702450700933873
5945. to be on the safe side	i never let eileen get out of my sight day or night.	8.037670474887106
5946. i couldn't make out what his racket was.	11.633205579815934
5947. i'd	thought him a pimp or procurer but he didn't seem to be.	5.799449097473636
5948. he was smooth	and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under	his selfeffacing manner.	9.726305672138423
5949. still he let eileen treat him like a valet.	7.53601356534174
5950. whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was precious	who did the work.	7.242499728229622
5951. i never could find out what his business was.	11.862600051581408
5952. he always seemed to have money in his pocket.	14.282612857549505
5953. the phone had been	disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger.	7.0685292028505895
5954. now and then he would disappear for several days.	11.94873118254724
5955. connections	was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when i put leading	questions.	5.542917982132687
5956. oh he's just an international spy eileen would	shout with her screechy laugh.	8.125242739812563
5957. poor devil he can't have been	too happy either.	7.387108900330429
5958. he got no relief from drink because though sometimes	precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the	evening he'd leave it on the table untouched.	8.142952440896329
5959. when i was in	liquor i rode him pretty hard i guess.	9.821767976369795
5960. occasionally if i pushed	him too far he'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel	bony skull would show through that smooth face of his.	6.454539978866754
5961. some day	i told eileen that guy will kill us both.	7.182488945632192
5962. getting drunk every night was the only way i	could handle the situation.	11.113194811171885
5963. eileen seemed to feel the same way.	7.240698345721332
5964. we still	had that much in common.	13.596829801400364
5965. the trouble was drinking cost money.	11.796572233694311
5966. the	way eileen and i were hitting it up we needed ten or fifteen dollars	an evening.	7.128552095543188
5967. eileen must have wheedled a little out of precious.	6.536123690965156
5968. i raised some kale by hocking the good clothes i had left over from	my respectable uptown life but when that was gone i didn't have a	cent.	6.9841860519312
5969. i don't know what we would have done if pat o'dwyer hadn't	come to town.	4.785392404426787
5970. pat o'dwyer looked like a heavier jim.	10.43018290012234
5971. he had the same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he didn't have	jim's pokerfaced humor or his brains or his charm.	6.537452383885511
5972. he was a big	thick beefy violent man.	17.955388739685983
5973. now pat may have been a lecher and a plugugly	but he was a good churchgoing catholic and he loved his little	sister.	7.0597840504904985
5974. those o'dwyers had that irish clannishness that made them	stick	together in spite of politics and everything.	8.849859233255112
5975. pat took eileen	and me out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears	in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again.	4.656645272807095
5976. whom god	hath joined etcetera.	11.568363037656766
5977. the o'dwyers were real religious people	except for kate.	8.341215694113531
5978. now it would be up to me to keep the little girl	out of mischief.	11.692101412132873
5979. pat had been worried as hell ever since she'd lost	her job on that fashion magazine.	5.704937655056327
5980. it had gone big with the hollywood	girls when he told them his sister was an editor of art and apparel.	9.216303299553164
5981. how about me trying to help her get her job back?	8.099485357631183
5982.    all	evening eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready	for her first communion.	6.886249538313906
5983. it just about blew us both out of the water	when eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with.	6.8660872082863795
5984. but brother	i can't take a job right now she said with her eyes on her	ice cream i'm going to have a baby francis xavier's baby	my own husband's baby.	7.569538489759953
5985. my first thought was how had it	happened so soon but i counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd	been living together six weeks.	5.0221909599755055
5986. pat meanwhile was bubbling over with	sentiment.	9.670406878971576
5987. greatest thing that ever happened.	8.254441635698543
5988. now eileen really	would have to settle down to love honor and obey and she'd have to	quit drinking.	7.401614491736262
5989. he'd come east for the christening by god he would.	6.210871206873012
5990. when we separated that evening pat pushed a hundred dollar bill	into eileen's hand to help towards a layette.	8.579083963779446
5991. before he left	town pat saw to it that i was fixed up with a job.	9.163222267031214
5992. pat had contacts	all over the labor movement.	9.060328853487057
5993. a friend of pat's named frank sposato	had just muscled into the portwatchers' union.	6.40132428842376
5994. the portwatchers	were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats	and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves.	7.333060553020843
5995. most of them were	elderly men.	21.914678413878597
5996. it was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because	the thieving is awful in the port of new york.	10.538541408029781
5997. they weren't as	well paid as they should have been.	8.175689281675892
5998. one reason the portwatchers let	sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen.	9.168056960659289
5999. sposato needed a front some labor stiff with a clean record to	act as business agent of the redhook local.	5.18729781514116
6000. there i was a retired	wobbly and structural iron worker who'd never gouged a cent off a fellow	worker in my thirty years in the movement.	8.895875685497195
6001. for once radicalism was	a recommendation.	11.618969564762878
6002. sposato couldn't wait to get me hired.	9.060328853487057
6003. with my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance i certainly looked	the honest working stiff.	6.579043274294942
6004. the things a man will do for a woman.	11.551772721183386
6005. there was one fact which rector could not overlook one truth which	he could not deny.	9.243595084307207
6006. as long as there were two human beings working together	on the same project there would be competition and you could no	more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave.	8.730612174533634
6007. no matter	how devoted a man was no matter how fully he gave his life to the lord	he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition	as an individual.	5.868777919523357
6008. all of the jobs in the mission might be equal	in the eyes of the lord but they were certainly not equal in the	eyes of the lord's servants.	9.273742487911763
6009. it was only natural that fletcher would	strive for a position in which he could make the decisions.	11.484330508902254
6010. even rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he	knew it not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church-	his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career-	but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel.	6.1723191090570575
6011. he	was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church	and how much was his own ego demanding to be satisfied for the two	were intertwined and could not be separated.	5.5142433547999765
6012. he wanted desperately	to see kayabashi defeated the communists in the village rooted out	the mission standing triumphant for in the triumph of the lord he	himself would be triumphant too.	8.275537506667405
6013. but perhaps this was a part of the	eternal plan that man's ambition when linked with god would be a driving	indefatigable force for good in the world.	7.273004600267526
6014. how foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith	would suffice.	11.308949440941413
6015. he would have to work without questioning the motives	which made him work and content himself with the thought that the	eventual victory however it was brought about would be sweet indeed.	6.875814897269104
6016. his first move was to send hino to the village to spend a few days.	7.99209079454377
6017. his arm had been giving him some trouble and rector was not enough	of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or	whether hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print	shop using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse.	4.654322151995442
6018. in any event rector	sent him to the local hospital to have it checked telling him to	keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find	out what kayabashi was planning.	10.19083074894605
6019. hino was elated at the prospect.	7.622507342753323
6020. he was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital	and he was given some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor-	an excellent place to make contact with the enemy.	8.641130102756106
6021. he left with all	the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday nodding attentively	as rector gave him his final instructions.	0.0
6022. he was to get involved in	no	arguments; he was to try to make no converts; he was simply to listen	and report back what he heard.	10.66346340179055
6023. it was a ridiculous situation	and rector knew it for hino frankly partisan openly gregarious	would make a poor espionage agent.	7.724951828812063
6024. if he wanted to know anything he	would end up asking about it point-blank but in this guileless manner	he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to	get them by indirection.	7.516771564358079
6025. in all of his experience in the mission field	rector had never seen a convert quite like hino.	10.70843057972297
6026. from the moment	that hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job any job-	his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise	hand- he had been ready to become a christian.	8.66986691485539
6027. he had already been	studying the bible; he knew the fundamentals and after studying	with fletcher for a time he approached rector announced that he wanted	to be baptized and that was that.	6.846327333908216
6028. rector had never been able	to find out much about hino's past.	8.286754097963518
6029. hino talked very little about	himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration	in connection with another subject.	5.4513335250013615
6030. putting the pieces of	this mosaic together rector had the vague outlines of a biography.	7.151351539358647
6031. hino	was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast in	chiba and divided his life between the land and the sea supplementing	the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment	on a fishing boat.	5.159051802320863
6032. without exception hino's brothers turned	to either one or both of their father's occupations but hino showed	a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach	where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller.	7.048662339813435
6033. he had gone into the japanese navy had been trained as an officer	had participated in one or two battles- he never went into detail	regarding his military experience- and at the age of twenty-five	quite as a bolt out of the blue he had walked into the mission as if	he belonged here and had become a christian.	6.398377394953877
6034. rector was often curious;	often tempted to ask questions but he never did.	7.820048028238166
6035. if and when hino	decided to tell him about his experiences he would do so unasked.	9.36313086480133
6036. rector had no doubt that hino would come back from the village	bursting with information ready to impart it with his customary gusto	liberally embellished with his active imagnation.	6.74112264670777
6037. when the telephone	rang on the day after hino went down to the village rector had	a hunch it would be hino with some morsel of information too important	to wait until his return for there were few telephones in the village	and the phone in rector's office rarely rang unless it was important.	5.369708241574286
6038. he was surprised to find kayabashi's secretary on the other	end of the line.	10.107316701574787
6039. he was even more startled when he heard what kayabashi	wanted.	9.378002807679255
6040. the oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries the	secretary said businessmen from tokyo for the most part and kayabashi	wished to show them the mission.	8.928082391711982
6041. they had never seen one before	and had expressed a curiosity about it.	8.79326306085581
6042. i guess it will be all right.	15.140397752418034
6043. when would the oyabun like	to bring his guests up here?	7.975657520711742
6044.    this afternoon the	secretary said.	16.48682148135584
6045. at three o'clock if it will be of convenience to	you at that time.	8.872935817204608
6046. i will	be expecting them.	18.694724422724896
6047. he was about to hang up the phone but	a note of hesitancy in the secretary's voice left the conversation	open.	8.061389058246455
6048. he had something more to say.	17.179290268138082
6049. i beg to inquire if the back	is now safe for travelers he said.	7.033748404049442
6050. unless the oyabun has been working on it he said	then checked himself and added: you can tell kayabashi-san	that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for	his party to use.	7.0768680620724895
6051. the secretary	sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in rector's	hand.	7.9867663559367745
6052. rector had no idea why kayabashi wanted to visit the mission.	8.61349622982108
6053. for the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great	weakness or an indication of equally great confidence and from all	the available information it was probably the latter.	5.872743400974493
6054. kayabashi must	feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this	a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the	village.	8.865511003553182
6055. at the same time it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend	a day in a christian mission out of mere curiosity.	9.019168236868724
6056. no kayabashi	was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and rector	would not be able to fathom it until they arrived.	7.881464131716193
6057. when he had	given the call a few moments thought he went into the kitchen to ask	mrs yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors using	the formal english china and the silver tea service which had been	donated to the mission then he went outside to inspect the grounds.	5.826678254699957
6058. fujimoto	had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn.	10.86758474768027
6059. rector asked	him to move it for the time being; he wanted the mission compound	to be effortlessly spotless.	6.534166181192953
6060. a good initial impression would be important	now.	12.567118006690933
6061. he went into the print shop where fletcher had just finished	cleaning the press.	9.271895102746381
6062. how many pamphlets do we have in stock?	14.059499323853887
6063. 	rector said.	12.292407525564322
6064. i should say about a hundred thousand	fletcher said.	16.095592040991242
6065. why?	15.610129252044759
6066.    i would like to enact	a little tableau this afternoon rector said he explained about	the visit and the effect he wished to create the picture of a very busy	mission.	8.623605076921264
6067. he did not wish to deceive kayabashi exactly just to display	the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner.	7.544752132504697
6068. fletcher	nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange	the things rector requested.	8.612835154716992
6069. rector's next stop was at	the schoolroom where mavis was monitoring a test.	5.825820622377272
6070. he beckoned to her	from the door and she slipped quietly outside.	9.592132658614503
6071. he told her of the visitors	and then of his plans.	9.794214825868265
6072. how many children do you have present	today?	14.06286079819661
6073.  he said.	21.889553134177078
6074. she looked back toward the schoolroom.	13.824323613423559
6075. no only fourteen.	14.344404360913732
6076. the little ito girl	had to go home.	12.668093584285918
6077. she has a pretty bad cold.	12.95154123597628
6078. i would	like them to appear very busy today not busy exactly but joyous exuberant	full of life.	8.237409910283183
6079. i want to create the impression of a compound	full of children.	10.734320885412176
6080. do you think you can manage it?	21.76719848278703
6081.    mavis	smiled.	15.610129252044759
6082. as rector was walking back toward	the residential hall johnson came out of the basement and bounded up	to him.	9.71117526962787
6083. the altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen	his spirits but he was still a little wary around rector for they	had not yet discussed the incident.	5.9640583129001055
6084. i think i've fixed the pump	so we won't have to worry about it for a long time he said.	14.135809511476369
6085. i've	adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water	gets too low.	6.151154033551881
6086. he looked out over	the expanse of the compound.	11.45143587764551
6087. it was going to take a lot of activity	to fill it.	17.112607159845755
6088. have you ever operated a transit?	20.033130940002824
6089.  he said.	21.889553134177078
6090. you are about to become a	first-class surveyor rector said.	13.104633790155063
6091. when konishi gets back with	the jeep i want you to round up two or three japanese boys.	6.974736967806781
6092. you'll find an old transit in the basement.	4.666798494482245
6093. the	glass is out of it but that won't matter.	8.803927093794105
6094. it looks pretty efficient	and that's the important thing.	14.369444322316204
6095. he went on to explain what he	had in mind.	13.369175489810937
6096. he said he could do it.	28.596437996380505
6097. rector	was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential	hall.	7.25636052160854
6098. it was rather a childish game all in all but everybody	seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not	remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much.	10.13472207267773
6099. he was	not sure what effect it would have but that was really beside the point	when you got right down to it.	6.909235075773001
6100. he was not going to lose the mission	by default and whatever reason kayabashi had for bringing his little	sight-seeing group to the mission he was going to be in for a surprise.	10.99516345094217
6101. he found elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make	sure everything was in order in the residential hall and then to take	charge of the office while the party was here.	6.046810039738061
6102. when everything had been	done rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly	report until three o'clock.	8.09287208526567
6103. at two thirty he sent fujimoto	to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to	keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed	the approach of kayabashi's party.	6.60005812239566
6104. then rector attired in his best	blue serge suit sat in a chair out on the lawn in the shade of a	tree smoking a cigarette and waiting.	7.088216909555334
6105. the air was cooler here and the	lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass an effect	which he found pleasant.	6.246459540431902
6106. she concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one	be inconvenient.	9.560673035057837
6107. the fish took the bait.	11.538123230100371
6108. he replied that he	could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with	a stranger but- joy of joys he would be at home at the hour mentioned.	7.264880315707882
6109. but when she called he had thought better of the matter	and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement.	6.959320624489185
6110. she was told	by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged	on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed.	8.963784377839454
6111. claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff	daunt her purpose.	7.585381086637271
6112. she wrote again and now abandoning for the moment	the theme of love she asked for help in the matter of her career.	9.565927065369122
6113. she could act and she could write.	9.815573151004429
6114. his lordship was concerned in the	management of drury lane but if there were no opportunities there	would he read and criticize her novel?	7.415843993611394
6115.    at last he consented	to meet her and following that brief interview claire wrote him a	yet more remarkable proposal:   have you any objection to the	following plan?	5.8318323929441
6116.  on thursday evening we may go out of town together	by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles.	0.0
6117. there	we shall be free and unknown; we can return the following morning	h   she concluded by asking for a brief interview- to settle	with you where- and she threw in a tribute to his gentle	manners and the wild originality of your countenance.	4.686567133320159
6118. she opened his reply with trembling fingers h he agreed! and	he would see her that evening.	7.735353964671092
6119. victory at last!   at their	meeting he told her not to bother about where- he would attend	to that.	5.236383152695367
6120. there was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and as	claire	rose to go he asked her to sing him one song before she left.	13.26944735102098
6121. she sang him scott's charming ballad rosabelle which was the	vogue of the moment.	6.652099300943592
6122. she had never sung better.	17.556434645016964
6123. your voice	is delightful he approved with a warm smile.	7.0413287261957445
6124. tomorrow will	be a new experience- i have never before made love to a nightingale	h.	7.487102552994445
6125. there have been cooing doves chattering magpies thieving jackdaws	a proud peacock a silly goose and a harpy eagle- whom i was	silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals.	6.026026338924263
6126. and so they went he choosing of all places an inn near medmenham	abbey scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the hellfire	club.	7.887792682824567
6127. he regaled claire with an account of the mock mass performed	by the cassocked bloods which he had had at firsthand from old	bud dodington one of the leaders of the so-called order.	6.752089412467822
6128. each	wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this it seems was not	employed for self-flagellation h.	6.757567981697296
6129. naked girls danced in the chancel	of the abbey the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen	to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities.	4.808070905031883
6130. the jaded	amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish.	10.389679610768761
6131. alas	all that belonged to the age of devil dashwood and wicked	wilkes abbot and beadsman of the order! the casual seduction	of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison.	5.1240582989812395
6132. they passed close by the turn to bishopsgate.	11.949284741652804
6133. a scant half mile	away shelley and mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace	the air about them scented with stock and listening to the nightingale	who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden.	5.074668193690336
6134. charming	and peaceful- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure?	7.391013650626644
6135. 	alone with the fabulous byron! how many women had longed	for the privilege that was hers.	5.427950274147271
6136. how was she to behave claire	wondered.	12.494456028220794
6137. to be passive to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd.	8.756877241621655
6138. she was the pursuer as clearly as was venus in shakespeare's poem.	10.697090553442623
6139. and while her adonis did not suffer from inexperience satiety might	well be an equal handicap.	6.982464332125161
6140. no she would not pretend modesty but	neither must she be crudely bold.	8.520487136832335
6141. mystery- that was the thing.	10.198760548033663
6142. in	the bedroom she would insist on darkness.	9.884292315564585
6143. with his club foot he might	well be grateful.	8.746806372014115
6144. at the inn which was situated close to a	broad weir byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference	and addressed as milord.	7.8899523313232285
6145. the place was evidently a familiar	haunt and claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated	in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown.	6.161660298932098
6146. the fire	in the sitting room was lighted.	12.224206060003265
6147. what about the bedroom?	13.359616238729945
6148. 	byron inquired.	15.594944937291627
6149. seems to me last time i was here the grate bellowed	out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell.	6.010707189109018
6150. we found some owls had built a nest in the chimney milord but	i promise you you'll never have trouble of that sort again.	7.4565923015719235
6151. so not only had he been here before but it seemed he might well	come again.	6.185495741148917
6152. claire felt suddenly small and cheap heroine of a trivial	episode in the voluminous history of don juan.	6.91428702219724
6153. a cold supper	was ordered and a bottle of port.	7.563545188002981
6154. when napoleon's ship had borne	him to elba french wines had started to cross the channel the first	shipments in a dozen war-ridden years but the supplies had not yet	reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the spanish peninsula	still ruled.	6.294844856467061
6155. as they waited for supper they sat by the	fire glasses in hand while byron philosophized as much for his own	entertainment as hers.	6.036456660580829
6156. sex is overpriced he said.	10.472119682746735
6157. the	great greek tragedies are concerned with man against fate not	man against man for the prize of a woman's body.	5.763413703881979
6158. so don't see yourself	as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major	importance.	7.6505409248355045
6159. the gods seemed to think sex pretty important	she rebutted.	7.839212140222358
6160. mars and venus bacchus and ariadne jupiter	and io byron and the nymph of the owl's nest.	6.757567981697296
6161. that would be	minerva i suppose.	13.01734789722337
6162. wasn't the owl her symbol?	8.442266106666008
6163.    byron	laughed.	15.610129252044759
6164. so you know something of the classics do you?	14.757775879084994
6165. 	tell me about minerva how she behaved what she did to please	you.	5.825820622377272
6166. i don't ask you who 'tis	you're being unfaithful to husband or lover.	6.03737696379835
6167. for a moment she thought of answering with the truth	but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity who demanded	some	degree of education in body as well as mind.	6.570067435927975
6168. very well	she said i'll not catechize you.	10.406870681543984
6169. what matter the others so long	as i have my place in history.	7.051663718466665
6170. she was striking the right	note.	17.22621989152487
6171. no man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed with	one so favored flattery could hardly seem overdone.	5.8386938216470705
6172. brains and beauty	high position in both the social and intellectual worlds athlete	fabled lover- if ever the world was any man's oyster it was his.	7.211003056651294
6173. the light supper over claire went to him and slipping an arm	about his shoulder sat on his knee.	6.290504059766844
6174. he drew her close and hand on	cheek turned her face to his.	9.176540466704445
6175. her lips moist and parted spoke his	name.	8.154987146205233
6176. byron!   his hand went to her shoulder and	pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown;	then to better purpose he took hold of the knot and with dextrous	fingers untied it.	5.925191657312866
6177. the bodice beneath was buttoned and withdrawing	his lips from hers he set her upright on his knee and started to	undo it unhurriedly as if she were a child.	5.239638533125812
6178. but kindled by	his kiss his caressing hand her desire was aflame.	9.887008010130634
6179. she sprang up and	went swiftly to the bedroom.	8.472846859613272
6180. lord byron poured himself another glass	of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color.	7.016717234447779
6181. he drank slowly with due appreciation.	10.776005861178222
6182. it was an excellent vintage.	30.439577967103027
6183. he rose and went to the bedroom.	11.67110578003823
6184. pausing in the doorway he said:	the form of the human female unlike her mind and her spirit	is the most challenging loveliness in all nature.	6.570130751489062
6185. when claire	returned to bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become	byron's mistress.	7.344191199697148
6186. by odd coincidence on the evening of her return	shelley chose to read parisina which was the latest of the titled	poet's successes.	8.137757792318178
6187. as he declaimed the sonorous measures it was	as much as claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with	her dramatic tidings.	6.066800874164377
6188. although it is not the best of which	he is capable said shelley as he closed the book it is still	poetry of a high order.	9.96844461426977
6189. if he would only leave the east	said mary.	12.511589232225859
6190. i am tired of sultans and scimitars.	14.894444268829886
6191. the hero of his next poem is napoleon bonaparte said claire	with slightly overdone carelessness.	6.683696445201504
6192. how do you know that?	18.27407625484657
6193. 	demanded mary.	12.292407525564322
6194. i was told it on good authority	claire answered darkly.	15.479121240162312
6195. i mustn't tell i mustn't tell	she repeated to herself.	8.555241096529764

6199. with a pardonable	irony shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his	daughter:   fanny and mrs godwin will probably be glad	to hear that mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement	and that her child is well.	5.27360374080319
6200. at the same time another	child- this one of shelley's brain- was given to the world:	alastor a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze	into the still depths of a fine mind's musings.	9.155893304247572
6201. alastor was published	only to be savagely attacked contemptuously ignored.	6.460370037324521
6202. shelley	sent a copy to southey a former friend and another to godwin.	7.391013650626644

6208. how can you say such a thing?	16.434059458064386
6209.  there	will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of alastor.	6.209444661039578
6210. there	are some even now.	13.183222779291485
6211. what about that dear clever mr thynne?	9.428205570307522
6212. 	i am sure he is in raptures.	11.342895226771253
6213. poor mr thynne he	always has to be trotted out for my encouragement.	7.148088198988927
6214. there	are other mr thynnes.	13.183222779291485
6215. not everyone is bewitched by byron's	caliphs and harem beauties.	7.966666808519817
6216. mary's supercritical attitude	toward byron had nothing to do with his moral disrepute.	10.164926043974871
6217. she was resentful	of his easy success as compared with shelley's failure.	8.63051932496953
6218. the	same	month that alastor was published murray sold twenty thousand	copies of the siege of corinth a slovenly bit of byronism that	even shelley's generosity rebelled at.	6.09983039226678
6219. the lordly poet was	at low-water mark.	9.802060557618772
6220. the careless writing was in keeping with his mood	of savage discontent.	9.536240829713417
6221. on all sides doors were being slammed in his	face.	9.519353962095817
6222. the previous scandals gaily diverting as they were had only	served to increase his popularity.	8.809103666031113
6223. now under the impact of his wife's	disclosures he was brought suddenly to the realization that there	was a limit to tolerance however brilliant however far-famed the offender	might be.	5.9451828695363815
6224. he tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion	to his half sister but he soon saw as did she that this course if persisted	in would involve them in a common ruin.	7.2417581632820935
6225. for the moment there	was no woman in his life and it was this vacuum that had given claire	her opportunity.	9.376989776293748
6226. but the liaison successfully started in the	last days of autumn was now languishing.	10.591818778555064

6228. he refused to bring claire to it even as an occasional visitor	claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the milbankes.	7.000426104312035
6229. beckworth handed the pass to the colonel.	7.14162538120728
6230. he had thought that	the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction	of serving his own order but the slip of paper was folded and absently	thrust into the colonel's belt.	6.722041560825782
6231. despite his yearning the colonel	would not go down to see the men come through the lines.	6.834192371133355
6232. he would	remain in the tent waiting impatiently occupied by some trivial	task.	9.592132658614503
6233. sir?	15.610129252044759
6234.    -fetch me the	copies of everything b and c companies have requisitioned in the	last	six months.	7.032105024464237
6235. the last six months sir?	13.960969536105498
6236.    -you	heard me.	15.594944937291627
6237. there's a lot of waste going on here.	4.326890144947143
6238. i want to take a look.	22.53324237015602
6239. this is no damned holiday beckworth.	17.890296607592607
6240. below	he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank.	9.382014288369923
6241. the colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs methodically	tearing at his thumbnail.	7.806007711952228
6242. the bombproof was	a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth.	9.005093323721033
6243. it	stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank.	8.65595042017059
6244. from the outside it	seemed no more than a low drumlin a lump on the dark earth.	11.485762097100272
6245. a crude	ladder ran down to a wooden floor.	9.24472622671088
6246. two slits enabled observers to watch	across the river.	9.85829515947488
6247. the place smelled strongly of rank fertile earth	rotting wood and urine.	7.5732635528843035
6248. the plank floor was slimed beneath watson's	boots.	11.387658710676023
6249. at least the union officer had been decent enough to provide	a candle.	9.113335589457066
6250. there was no place to sit but watson walked slowly	from the ladder to the window slits and back stooping slightly to avoid	striking his head on the heavy beams.	9.555146557224036
6251. in the corner was the soldier	with the white flag.	10.466002073342645
6252. he stood stiffly erect clutching the staff his	body half hidden by the limp cloth.	8.52351370118872
6253. watson hardly looked at him.	9.629045873528531
6254. the	man had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last	instant brandishing the flag of truce.	6.808967914079182
6255. someone had hauled him over	the side and he had remained silent while they crossed.	6.348278533242324
6256. an officer	with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank.	8.599255911894419
6257. the men in the	boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer two	of them calling him billy.	7.468302328520856
6258. when the boat had touched the weaker ones	and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the	soldiers.	7.9251333129924335
6259. watson had presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof.	8.81276501839752
6260. the officer had told him that both lists must be checked.	9.005093323721033
6261. watson	had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass.	7.459999840668314
6262. the officer surprised	said he would have to see.	16.1153995644715
6263. watson had nodded absently and muttered	that he would check the lists himself later.	6.156405695150847
6264. he had peered through	the darkness at the rampart.	13.852464038907144
6265. the men he would take back across	the river stood there but he turned away from them.	6.947911098226617
6266. he wanted no part	of the emotions of the exchange no memory of the joy and gratitude	that other men felt.	9.805809712328493
6267. he had hoped to be alone in the bombproof but the	soldier had followed him.	8.044838534125674
6268. though watson carefully ignored the man	he could not deny his presence.	9.228794048966249
6269. perhaps it would be better to speak	to him since silence could not exorcise his form.	8.070885212583322
6270. watson glanced briefly	at him seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner.	7.595093516586119
6271. we won't be too long.	8.086176013152713
6272. if my pass is approved i may	be a half hour.	10.550961433307789
6273. the soldier answered in a curious muffled voice	his lips barely moving.	7.098087065137257
6274. watson turned away and did not see the man's	knees buckle and his body sag.	8.360843618373119
6275. he	had acknowledged the man.	9.377765891583822
6276. it was easier to think now watson decided.	16.571667076119464
6277. the stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts.	7.098087065137257
6278. he	paced slowly stooping staring at the damp slippery floor.	8.196044167676531
6279. he tried	to order the words of the three union officers seeking to create some	coherent portrait of the dead boy.	8.307268059663611
6280. his lack	of success steadily eroded his interest.	10.276228481933904
6281. he stopped pacing leaned	against the dank timbered wall and let his mind drift.	6.955990454870539
6282. a feeling of	futility an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known	seeped through him.	7.830360531090303
6283. what in the name of god was he doing crouched	in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river?	8.415658580862917
6284.  why had he crossed	the dark water to bring back a group of reclaimed soldiers or	to skulk in a foul-smelling hole?	8.221040184272223
6285.    he grew annoyed and at the	same time surprised at that emotion.	9.153431586285322
6286. he was conscious of a growing sense	of absurdity.	14.649174995737313
6287. hillman had written it all out hadn't he?	6.764147616291221
6288.  wasn't	the report official enough?	11.568363037656766
6289.  what did he hope to accomplish here?	9.865657898260363
6290. 	hillman had ordered him not to leave the far bank.	10.6793070831903
6291. prompted by	a guilty urge he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected.	7.999702189406288
6292. for	what?	19.804021762487697
6293.  to tell john something he would find out for himself.	8.011070538818117
6294. the figure in the corner belched loudly a deep liquid eruption.	9.005093323721033
6295. watson	snorted and then laughed aloud.	8.254441635698543
6296. exactly!   the soldier's	voice was muffled again stricken with chagrin.	8.196044167676531
6297. he clutched the	staff	and his dark eyes blinked apologetically.	9.026368296067464
6298. let's get out of here.	11.56512701236161
6299. watson ran up the ladder	and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud	and river weeds.	6.101588461690517
6300. to his left the two skiffs dented their sharp bows	into the soft bank.	8.75525137210045
6301. the flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull	of the current.	7.43304005989246
6302. a soldier held the end of a frayed rope.	14.400414183198786
6303. three	union guards appeared carrying their rifles at ready.	6.764147616291221
6304. watson stared	at them	curiously.	16.02770385309362
6305. they were stocky men well fed and clean-shaven with	neat uniforms and sturdy boots.	7.379077553717503
6306. behind them shambled a long column of	weak tattered men.	10.077544672560576
6307. the thin gray figures raised a hoarse cawing cry	like the call of a bird flock.	6.196120048044738
6308. they moved toward the skiffs with shocking	eagerness elbowing and shoving.	9.805316538225382
6309. four men were knocked down but	did not attempt to rise.	6.991821140220314
6310. they crept down the muddy slope toward the	waiting boats.	10.372209341984666
6311. the union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy	indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs.	6.514369185680007
6312. the crawling men tried to rise and fell again.	9.945332631078985
6313. no one moved to them.	13.354177752336232
6314. watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened	to their voices beg shrilly.	8.60473856042395
6315. in a confused soaked and stumbling	shift of bodies and lifting arms the two men were dragged into the	same skiff.	6.83428128501159
6316. the third crawling man forced himself erect.	12.91624685253105
6317. he swayed	like a drunkard his arms milling in slow circles.	7.953394054598466
6318. he paced forward unsteadily	leaning too far back his head tilted oddly.	9.592132658614503
6319. his steps were	short and stiff and with his head thrown back his progress was a	supercilious strut.	6.227960812390213
6320. he appeared to be peering haughtily down his nose	at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom.	8.749110406491063
6321. he	stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed	barge his weight nearly swamping the craft.	7.257662076234089
6322. watson looked for	the fourth man.	12.216031715840696
6323. he had reached the three passive guards; he crept	in an incertain manner patting the ground before him.	7.037021288536089
6324. the guards did	not look at him.	12.435529358277208
6325. the figure on the earth halted seemingly bewildered.	9.362698053404962
6326. he sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound.	10.025491488719803
6327. then he began	to crawl again.	13.198141365735388
6328. watson watched the creeping figure.	12.216031715840696
6329. he felt a spectator	interest.	18.491281673362987
6330. would the man make it or not?	12.38515930773736
6331.  if only there was a	clock for him to crawl against.	11.125877179625602
6332. if he failed to reach the riverbank	in five minutes say then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping	in the mud.	8.48958019877512
6333. say three minutes to make it sporting.	9.349550694473386
6334. still the guards	did not move but stood inert aloof from the slow-scrambling man.	8.513931730322378
6335. the figure halted and watson gasped.	9.802060557618772
6336. the man began to creep in	the wrong direction deceived by a slight rise in the ground! he turned	slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart.	7.5950340079913445
6337. watson	raced for him his boots slamming the soft earth.	6.460370037324521
6338. the guards	came to life with astonishing menace.	11.387658710676023
6339. they spun and flung their rifles	up.	10.352492626598039
6340. one man dropped to his knee for	better aim.	13.50630850501655
6341. let me help him for the love of god!	the guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at watson	with sullen puzzled faces.	6.088651926746209
6342. watson pounded to the crawling man and	stopped panting heavily.	9.118357116017174
6343. he reached down and closed his fingers on	the man's upper arm.	7.560809233574742
6344. beneath his clutch a flat strip of muscle surged	on the bone.	8.331435498447835
6345. watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet.	7.332121987975533
6346. watson stared into a cadaverous face.	11.108380474026662
6347. two clotted balls the color	of mucus rolled between fiery lids.	6.9950108100073605
6348. light sticks of fingers the tips	gummy with dark earth patted at watson's throat.	7.884467034748245
6349. the man's voice	was a sweet patient whisper.	6.474858743052047
6350. henry said that he'd take	my arm and get me right there.	8.142309175209114
6351. it don't matter.	22.215501758012252
6352. is it far?	32.13126933560902
6353.    how far could	it be watson thought bleakly how far can a blind man crawl?	7.400754406384628
6354.  another	body length or all the rest of his nighted life?	14.740726935236808
6355.    -not	far.	15.610129252044759
6356. not like us fellas.	16.262159121021142
6357. it raises the voice	bein in camp.	12.998584141589314
6358. can	you walk?	15.594944937291627
6359.    -why course i can.	9.118533821976325
6360. i can walk real good.	20.635720571895614
6361. watson stumbled down the bank.	9.629045873528531
6362. the man leaned his frail body	against watson's shoulder.	13.62675746881857
6363. he was no heavier than a child.	12.878120353746112
6364. the man wheezed weakly his fetid breath beating	softly against watson's neck.	11.024051692367026
6365. his sweet whisper came after great effort.	8.100034263261762
6366. i wish you was henry h.	16.15277828825249
6367. he promised	to take me.	14.0564280108931
6368. watson	supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure	over the bow of the nearest skiff.	8.648874463809031
6369. the man swayed on a thwart turning	his ruined eyes from side to side.	7.864590117251196
6370. watson turned away sickened for	the first time in many months.	10.424906010186023
6371. he heard the patient voice calling.	11.7324718071717
6372. henry?	19.804021762487697
6373.  where are you henry?	11.992927780254675
6374.    -make him lie	down!   watson snatched a deep breath.	8.581436094141479
6375. he had not meant to shout.	14.901779025467722
6376. he stood with his back to the skiff.	13.461661557537576
6377. the men mewed and scratched	begging to be taken away.	11.398975342868589
6378. watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night	flecked with pine-knot torches.	8.699688537053031
6379. goddamn you! what	do you do to them?	7.14162538120728
6380.    intelligence jabbed at him accusingly.	10.472119682746735
6381. he had not felt that during the afternoon.	11.825784660211932
6382. all his emotions had been inward self-conscious.	12.012219753049246
6383. in	war on a night like this it was only the outward emotions that mattered	what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others.	5.653036179199081
6384. he was sure of it.	19.87986593677342
6385. john's type of man allowed	this sort of thing to happen.	7.6117516447620455
6386. what a fool he had been to think of	his brother! so charles was dead.	10.350556947602161
6387. what did it matter?	14.219272258525194
6388.  his name	had been crossed off a list.	10.276228481933904
6389. already his cool body lay in the ground.	8.380403951514873

6461. she was not a girl he	could see.	13.584195726694594

6491. i've seen you walking your dogs on sunday and driving by	in the convertible h.	4.340300937427907
6492. the thought of this lonely woman sitting	at her window touched him although he was even more touched by	her plumpness.	7.891165918510941
6493. sheer plumpness he knew is not a vital part of the	body and has no procreative functions.	6.145746643344818
6494. it serves merely as an excess	cushion for the rest of the carcass.	15.268266595013417
6495. and knowing its humble place in	the scale of things why did he at this time of life seem almost ready	to sell his soul for plumpness?	6.10161097369116
6496.  the remarks she made about the sufferings	of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he didn't	know what to make of them but after the sixth drink he put his arm around	her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook	there.	5.923086198837605
6497. i've never done this before she said later	when he was arranging himself to leave.	4.240163322596448
6498. her voice shook with feeling	and he thought it lovely.	11.285887032381407
6499. he didn't doubt her truthfulness although	he had heard the words a hundred times.	5.092610775338445
6500. i've never done this	before they always said shaking their dresses down over their white	shoulders.	5.379346023429161
6501. i've never done this before they always said	waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor.	4.3593196196023705
6502. i've never done	this before they always said pouring another whiskey.	5.5834035511962465

6504. on ships at sea on railroad trains in summer hotels with mountain views	they always said i've never done this before.	7.190444500174982
6505. where	have you been?	10.363724110347151
6506.  mrs pastern asked sadly when he came	in.	10.359544399544296
6507. i had a drink with the flannagans.	13.809743055908283
6508. she told me he was in germany.	16.900888065503604
6509. charlie ate some supper in the	kitchen and went into the tv room to hear the news.	6.363478252049533
6510. throw a little nuclear hardware at them! show	them who's boss! but in bed he had trouble sleeping.	6.643215071337043
6511. he thought	first of his son and daughter away at college.	7.953394054598466
6512. it was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known.	24.06132912095731
6513. then he	played nine imaginary holes of golf choosing his handicap his irons	his stance his opponents and his weather in detail but the green of	the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries.	5.3132623201091
6514. his money	was tied up in a nassau hotel an ohio pottery works and a detergent	for window-washing and luck had been running against him.	6.924188682562761
6515. his	worries harried him up out of bed and he lighted a cigarette and went	to the window.	6.570019856485047
6516. in the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their	leaves.	13.896146012936814
6517. during the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses	at the track and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel	tickets would still be lying like leaves in the gutters near belmont	and saratoga.	6.095339313475926
6518. maple and ash beech and elm one hundred to win on	three in the fourth fifty to win on six in the third one hundred	to win on two in the eighth.	6.58203938916234
6519. children walking home from school would	scuff through what seemed to be his foliage.	8.25796484020042
6520. then getting back into	bed he thought unashamedly of mrs flannagan planning where they	would next meet and what they would do.	7.011151409785722
6521. there are he thought so few	true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the	medicine even when the medicine seemed as it did a little crude?	6.444910866180702
6522. 	it was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been	to see her for ten years not since their last journey eastward to witness	their uncle izaak being lowered into the rocky soil; that aside	from due notification of certain major events in their lives	christmas and easter cards of the	traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through	the widowed years.	5.753182808378817
6523. her thoughts were not discrete.	9.707775903539014
6524. but there was	a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons.	12.897965175851972
6525. she	grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright like a bird	alert for flight.	5.427950274147271
6526. she turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the	dainty-legged escritoire warped and cracked now from fifty years in	an atmosphere of sea spray.	6.992963546113194
6527. there she extracted two limp vellum sheets	and wrote off the letters one to abel one to mark.	6.8984630165675
6528. once	her trembling hand with the pen grasped tight in it was pressed against	the paper the words came sharply smoothly as authoritatively as	they would dropping from her own lips.	5.907722020352733
6529. and the stiffly regal look of	them she saw grimly lacked the quaver of age which thwarting the efforts	of her amazing will ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged	string.	5.3053228611749175
6530. please come down as soon as you conveniently can	the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen i have an	important matter to discuss with you.	6.644910366148927
6531. to abel: i am afraid	there is not much to amuse small children here.	7.015216015390462
6532. i should be obliged	if you could make other arrangements for your daughters.	11.264788639673803
6533. you may stay	as long as you wish of course but if arranging for the care of the	girls must take time into account i think a day or two should be enough	to finish our business in.	6.188648699562952
6534. to mark: please give my regards	to myra.	11.56969976888144
6535. she signed the letters quickly stamped them and	placed them on the hall table for raphael to mail in town.	6.2546576737655695
6536. then she	went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the	glare on the water.	8.136687768573724
6537. my nephews will be coming down she	said that evening as angelina brought her dinner into the dining room	the whole meal on a vast linen-covered tray.	5.022727719578544
6538. she looked at the girl	speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years; from the	early evening lights of them which had first startled izaak to look	at	her in an uncousinly way they had faded to a near-absence of color which	had possibly from her constant looking at the water something of	the light of the sea in them.	6.225677578050518
6539. angelina placed the tray on the	table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth.	5.667261151085284
6540. she smiled	and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face.	9.118601195872367
6541. that	will be so nice for you mrs packard she said.	6.210871206873012
6542. her voice was	ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in sicilian brilliance before	the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose.	6.42623539572226
6543. um said the old lady and brought her eyes down to the tray.	6.360513988104634
6544. you remember them i suppose?	17.055565169455456
6545.  she glinted suspiciously at the	dish before her: blowfish.	8.472846859613272
6546. i hope raphael bought them whole.	15.204345105273354
6547. angelina stepped back her eyes roaming the tray for omissions.	6.210871206873012
6548. then she looked at the old woman again her eyes calm.	10.796453152009201
6549. yes	she said i remember that they came here every summer.	6.210871206873012
6550. i used to play with the older one sometimes when he'd let me.	10.612196954204803
6551. abel?	15.610129252044759
6552. 	the name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips.	7.879513779734377
6553. for an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through	her smile.	8.215617826123031
6554. she would have said triumph.	19.498239344786793
6555. then angelina turned and	with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen.	7.0054235509862846
6556. jessica packard	lifted her head and followed the retreating figure her eyes resting	nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips.	6.783518219632277
6557. for a moment she held her face to the empty doorway; then she snorted	and groped for her fork.	7.370056338069433
6558. there's no greater catastrophe	in the universe she reflected dourly impaling tender green beans	on the silver fork than the dwindling away of a family.	5.09523262356556
6559. procreation	expansion proliferation- these are the laws of living things with	the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments: oblivion.	6.333840227770071
6560. when the fate of the individual is visited on the group then	warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed	ah then the true bitterness of	existence could be tasted.	7.394443877824211
6561. and indeed the young garden beans were brackish	in her mouth.	7.670163086720062
6562. she was the last living of the older generation.	15.482801962333035
6563. what had once been a widespread family- at one time she knew	there were enough packards to populate an entire county- had now	narrowed down to the two boys abel and mark.	6.376287357056811
6564. she swung her eyes up	to the blue of the window her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans.	8.75781434678583
6565. what hope lay in the nephews she asked the intensifying light out there	with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced having	sired two girl children with none to bear on the packard name?	6.001879628446406
6566. 	she ate.	15.594944937291627
6567. it seemed to her as it seemed each night that the gloom	drew itself in and became densest at the table's empty chairs	giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows.	6.198054733153335
6568. here too	she talked low quirking her head at one or another of the places	most often at izaak's armchair which faced her across the long table.	7.86615713645147
6569. or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed consciously	playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early	years.	8.404218412337457
6570. she thought again of her children those two who had	died young before the later science which might have saved them could	attach even a label to their separate malignancies.	6.428374313227177
6571. the girl her	first she barely remembered.	9.802060557618772
6572. it could have been anyone's infant for	it had not survived the bassinet.	15.177336252368628
6573. but the boy h the boy had been	alive yesterday.	10.024173892536204
6574. each successive movement in his growing was recorded	on the unreeling film inside her.	7.959280541638137
6575. he ran on his plump sticks of	legs	freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the	camera had caught and held on the paling photographs all carefully placed	and glued and labeled resting in the fat plush album in the bottom	drawer of the escritoire.	4.666771840793531
6576. in the cruel clearness of her memory the	boy remained unchanged quick with the delight of laughter and the pain	with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable	to her.	7.098656259451035
6577. it was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water	on those days when she hated the sea.	8.286136252348875
6578. the brothers drove	down together in mark's small red sports car mark at the wheel.	8.375756339709893
6579. abel sat and regarded the farm country which spreading	out from both sides of the road rolled greenly up to where the	silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields.	5.375939744716952
6580. he saw the land with a stranger's eyes all the old familiarness	gone.	10.753687026430354
6581. and it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger	impervious complete in itself.	8.612047785563002
6582. there was stability there too- a	color which his life had had once.	12.753554865570587
6583. that is what childhood is he told	himself.	13.075852284738653
6584. in the stiff neutral lines of the	telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of aunt jessica's	letter.	9.724444223281168
6585. what bad grace what incredible selfishness he and mark	had shown.	7.725645779685622
6586. the boyhood summers preceding their uncle's funeral might	never have been.	9.430036403335416
6587. they had closed over absolutely with the sealing	of old izaak's grave.	8.46047106258667
6588. the small car flew on relentlessly.	13.082895766937119
6589. the old	woman stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took	on an ominous reality.	6.991749931789798
6590. abel moved and adjusted his long legs.	9.060328853487057
6591. i suppose it has to do with the property mark had said over	the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters.	8.667052625835595
6592. not until the words had been spoken did abel suddenly see the old house	and the insistent sea and feel his contrition blotted out in one	shameful moment of covetousness.	7.206757083698903
6593. he and mark were the last of the family	and there lay the cape ann property which had seemed to have no	end stretching from horizon to horizon in those golden days of summer.	6.4319781968414995
6594. now abel turned his head to look at his brother.	10.995489915671905
6595. mark held	the wheel loosely but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful	way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd	make in the years to come.	5.68031928009229
6596. his sandy hair was already beginning	to thin and recede at the sides and abel looked quickly away.	7.973939490916092
6597. mark	easily looked years older than himself settled his world comfortably	categorized.	6.210871206873012
6598. the vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they	approached the sea.	9.430036403335416
6599. she didn't mention bringing myra mark	said maneuvering the car into the next lane.	5.485779890181826
6600. she's probably	getting old- crotchety i mean- and we figured uh-uh better not.	6.067534619955805
6601. they've never met you know.	5.812284011925707
6602. but myra wouldn't budge without	an express invitation.	12.934994931595257
6603. i feel kind of bad about it.	11.19620160880235
6604. he gave abel	a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel hugging it to him and	abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt.	8.493441385927131
6605. i imagine	the old girl hasn't missed us much mark added his eyes on the	road.	6.789400154986115
6606. abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation.	9.060328853487057
6607. it was barely possible that his brother was right.	12.228242096961287
6608. he could	tell they were approaching the sea.	12.411802052220429
6609. the air took on a special strength	now that they'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind.	6.435656416413579
6610. there was the smell of the coast like a primeval memory composed	of equal parts salt water clams seaweed and northern air.	9.909780172872003
6611. he turned	from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy's eye	again the great fieldstone house which built on one of the many acres	of ancestral land bordering the west harbor had been izaak's bride-gift	to his cousin-wife as the last century ended.	5.131381054994681
6612. mark's	thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own climbing	the same crags in dirty white sneakers clambering out on top of the	headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant.	6.969525034961548
6613. remember the starbird?	16.18233276632486
6614.  mark asked and abel lifted his	eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road the twin white	ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of	the hill and came down.	8.192883822330788
6615. there	was the day uncle izaak had in an unexpected grandiose gesture	handed over the pretty sloop to abel for keeps on condition that	he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy	wished.	4.765083171768086
6616. the two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team	h all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth	and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance	could.	8.295100059162973
6617. they seemed then to have had a single mind and body a	mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth casually.	6.7445146450964995
6618. he saw the starbird as she lay her slender mast up and gently	turning its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus	sky.	7.835877980409735
6619. both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her	waiting ready for the two of them to run up her sails.	9.181841836176348
6620. the starbird	had been long at the bottom of the bay.	16.982789646879603
6621. they came unexpectedly	upon the sea.	12.824722361102804
6622. meeting it without preparation as they did robbed	of anticipation a common disappointment seized them.	8.677338000804655
6623. they were	climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid	blackness became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into	a faint mist of light and ended.	5.677267082527253
6624. mark stopped the car and switched	off the lights and they sat looking at the water which there being	no moon out at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an	absence of stars.	6.401661343209591
6625. his eyes were old and they never saw well but heated with whisky they'd	glare at my noise growing red and raising up his rage.	5.294250900054916
6626. i decided	i hated the pedersen kid too dying in our kitchen while i was away	where i couldn't watch dying just to entertain hans and making	me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall pa lumped under the	covers at the end like dung covered with snow snoring and whistling.	6.595434967468308
6627. oh he'd not care about the pedersen kid.	7.674607905193737
6628. he'd not care about getting	waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid	and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain.	6.75318259573934
6629. that would make	him mad enough if he was sober.	10.338761284592296
6630. i didn't hurry though it was cold	and the pedersen kid was in the kitchen.	8.295054385415657
6631. he was all shoveled	up like i thought he'd be.	10.068881193379493
6632. i pushed at his shoulder calling	his	name.	13.93195501835056
6633. i think his name stopped the snoring but he didn't move except	to roll a little when i shoved him.	6.827765609856476
6634. the covers slid down his skinny	neck so i saw his head fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed but	his face was turned to the wall- there was the pale shadow of his nose	on the plaster- and i thought well you don't look much like	a pig-drunk bully now.	6.267248460556303
6635. i couldn't be sure he was still asleep.	9.169644675936961
6636. he	was a cagey sonofabitch.	12.441832479896641
6637. i shook him a little harder and made some noise.	9.154018063055279
6638. i was leaning too far over.	16.70774452185394
6639. he always slept close to the wall so you had to lean	to reach him.	8.307069547557036
6640. it put you off.	22.5434124636122
6641. i knew better but	i was thinking of the pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough.	7.531087505680707
6642. when his arm came up i ducked away but it caught me on the side of	the neck watering my eyes and i backed off to cough.	8.441859367068144
6643. pa was on his	side looking at me his eyes winking the hand that had hit me a fist	in the pillow.	5.0176589645046334
6644. get the hell out of here.	11.283077324560365
6645. i didn't	say anything trying to get my throat clear but i watched him.	7.2742894140510215
6646. he was like a mean horse to come at from the rear.	11.123007742082926
6647. it was better though	he'd hit me.	16.79056552587768
6648. he was bitter when he missed.	17.218119440805356
6649. get the	hell out of here.	9.797449949533029
6650. he told me to wake	you.	24.059370645327075
6651. a fat hell on big hans.	9.356345845066523
6652. he found the pedersen kid by the crib.	12.2773748775717
6653. pa pulled at the covers.	8.254441635698543
6654. he was tasting his mouth.	19.87986593677342
6655. hans is rubbing him with snow.	7.622507342753323
6656. he's got him in the kitchen.	6.499541616015072
6657. it's the pedersen kid.	2.1393550040581193
6658. nothing	to steal from the crib.	10.472119682746735
6659. he was just	lying there.	18.754315787442366
6660. that's where he was when hans	found him.	6.073062069305468
6661. i ain't hid nothing in	the crib.	10.981588546931944
6662. the pedersen	kid.	23.714632315036916
6663. the kid-   i god damn well understand.	8.976097203071156
6664. pa	had his head up glaring his teeth gnawing at the place where he'd	grown a mustache once.	7.043104310168956
6665. i god damn well understand.	12.384361145835424
6666. you	know i don't want to see pedersen.	9.037790717084638
6667. why should i?	19.10530713190059
6668.  what	did he come for hey?	10.472119682746735
6669.  god dammit get.	14.08006203716601
6670. find out something.	22.237321373519293
6671. both you and hans.	11.089211415609126
6672. he was shouting	and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow.	10.599664273899362
6673. he had long	black hairs on his wrist.	12.04121248550523
6674. they curled around the cuff of his nightshirt.	11.075139487055674
6675. big hans made me come.	8.254441635698543
6676. big hans said-   a	fat hell on big hans.	8.581436094141479
6677. he's an even bigger fool than you are.	4.0522723948979165
6678. fat hey?	16.366879166810914
6679.  i taught him dammit and i'll teach you.	9.169644675936961
6680. you	want me to drop my pot?	9.670406878971576
6681.    he was about to get up so i got	out slamming the door.	11.175355033183747
6682. he was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep.	12.74303939037989
6683. once he went after hans and dumped his pot	over the banister.	7.211089669083017
6684. pa'd been shit-sick in that pot.	9.670406878971576
6685. he didn't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part	of pa's door down before he stopped.	4.742387220957449
6686. he might not have gone that	far if pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house.	9.200826619623347
6687. that pot put pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it.	7.431366446478654
6688. i	always felt the memory was present in both of them stirring in their	chests like a laugh or a growl as eager as an animal to be out.	5.950565555073685
6689. i	heard pa cursing all the way downstairs.	9.815968514427064
6690. hans had laid steaming	towels over the kid's chest and stomach.	7.879513779734377
6691. he was rubbing snow on	the kid's legs and feet.	10.068881193379493
6692. water from the snow and water from the towels	had run off the kid to the table where the dough was and the dough	was turning pasty sticking to the kid's back and behind.	6.622405731167124
6693. ain't	he going to wake up?	8.254441635698543
6694.    what about your pa?	16.948875083506145
6695. 	he was awake when i left.	7.622507342753323
6696. what'd he say?	13.148092146312546
6697. 	did you get the whisky?	9.109528565177627
6698.    he said a fat hell on big	hans.	18.35843327488095
6699. did you ask him about the whisky?	9.518277087454916
6700. 	yeah.	19.804021762487697
6701. well?	15.610129252044759
6702.    he said	a fat hell on big hans.	12.411802052220429
6703. what's	he going to do?	9.118533821976325
6704.    go back to sleep most likely.	12.732805972954381
6705. you'd best get that whisky.	7.076070424014453
6706. pa's scared to hell of axes.	9.670406878971576
6707. listen to me jorge	i've had enough to your sassing.	7.674589182642618
6708. if i don't	get some whisky down him he might die.	12.559469027848587
6709. you want the kid to die?	11.823504411807077
6710. 	do you?	15.594944937291627
6711.  well get your pa and get that whisky.	8.157632477990633
6712. pa	don't care about the kid.	10.472119682746735
6713. he don't care at all and i don't care to get my head	busted neither.	7.490520070586254
6714. he don't care and i don't care to have his shit	flung on me.	9.479471017011953
6715. he don't care about anybody.	12.127026643485452
6716. all he cares about is	his whisky and that dry crack in his face.	8.863152034329424
6717. get pig-drunk- that's	what he wants.	9.797449949533029
6718. he don't care about nothing else at all.	11.45143587764551
6719. that cock.	20.780458782818886
6720. i'll get the spirits ma said.	6.139485272299999
6721. i'd wound big	hans up tight.	5.384636745418132
6722. i was ready to jump but when ma said she'd get the	whisky it surprised him like it surprised me and he ran down.	8.106187680937065
6723. ma	never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off.	6.705218795173839
6724. not for years.	22.05289495736377
6725. the first thing every morning when she washed her face	she could see the scar on her chin where he'd cut her with a boot	cleat and maybe she saw him heaving it again the dirty sock popping	out as it flew.	5.4856977579256
6726. it should have been nearly as easy for her to remember	that as it was for big hans to remember going after the axe while	he was still spattered with pa's yellow sick insides.	8.576832771712825
6727. no	you won't big hans said.	8.254441635698543
6728. yes hans if they're	needed	ma said.	13.110616200649021
6729. hans shook his head but neither of us tried	to stop her.	6.583633325843117
6730. if we had then one of us would have had to go instead.	19.16600206360459
6731. hans rubbed the kid with more snow h rubbed h rubbed.	6.002446559592496
6732. i'll	get more snow i said.	9.364720305710975
6733. i took the pail and shovel and went	out on the porch.	7.656668534210395
6734. i don't know where ma went.	6.0250803233820855
6735. i thought she'd	gone upstairs and expected to hear she had.	8.602727392315117
6736. she had surprised hans	like she had surprised me when she said she'd go and then she surprised	him again when she came back so quick like she must have because	when i	came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three	white feathers on its label and hans was holding it angrily by the throat.	6.288166077322758
6737. oh he was being queer and careful pawing about in the	drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm.	6.053983985014928
6738. he was awful angry because he'd thought ma was going to do something	big something heroic even especially for her h i know him h	i know him h we felt the same sometimes h while ma wasn't thinking	about	that at all not anything like that.	7.047891665109764
6739. there was no way of getting	even.	21.162391408267943
6740. it wasn't like getting cheated at the fair.	13.388290833654258
6741. they were always	trying so you got to expect it.	9.108611709320193
6742. now hans had given ma something of	his- we both had when we thought she was going straight to pa-	something valuable; but since she didn't know we'd given it to her	there was no easy way of getting it back.	6.084743019488218
6743. hans cut the foil	off finally and unscrewed the cap.	6.460370037324521
6744. he was put out too because there	was only one way of understanding what she'd done.	10.359482742491902
6745. ma had found one	of pa's hiding places.	7.14162538120728
6746. she'd found one and she hadn't said a	word while big hans and i had hunted and hunted as we always did all	winter every winter since the spring that hans had come and i had	looked in the privy and found the first one.	5.7396344832536474
6747. pa had a knack for hiding.	7.622507342753323
6748. he knew we were looking and he enjoyed it.	12.90969536860853
6749. she'd	found it by luck most likely but she hadn't said anything and we didn't	know how long ago it'd been or how many other ones she'd found	saying nothing.	4.6904158433825796
6750. pa was sure to find out.	9.670406878971576
6751. sometimes he didn't	seem to because he hid them so well he couldn't find them himself or	because he looked and didn't find anything and figured he hadn't	hid one after all or had drunk it up.	4.677363592405363
6752. but he'd find out about this	one because we were using it.	10.43260142309222
6753. a fool could see what was going on.	8.618251835035405
6754. if	he found out ma found it- that'd be bad.	8.292150162768825
6755. he took pride in his	hiding.	14.104448539727901
6756. it was all the pride he had.	20.31527168853097
6757. i guess fooling hans and me took	doing.	9.95288923829895
6758. but he didn't figure ma for much.	16.54234329299358
6759. he didn't figure her	at all and if he found out	h a woman h it'd be bad.	5.117778105001956
6760. hans	poured some in a tumbler.	10.472119682746735
6761. you going to put more towels on him?	10.347486025628706
6762. 	no.	19.804021762487697
6763. why not?	18.319883046184035
6764.  that's what he needs	something warm to his skin don't he?	4.983647176066665
6765.    not where	he's froze good.	12.818325936063328
6766. that's why i only	put towels on his chest and belly.	4.750570176161539
6767. he's got to thaw slow.	4.168710858239306
6768. you ought	to know that.	20.025453829488345
6769. colors on the towels had run.	7.892588828502319
6770. ma poked	her toe in the kid's clothes.	9.060328853487057
6771. what are we going to do	with these?	16.767688103045334
6772.    big hans began pouring whisky in the kid's	mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in	a second it was dripping from his chin.	5.950565555073685
6773. here help me prop	him up.	11.837617072687397
6774. i got hold his mouth open.	13.93195501835056
6775. i didn't want to touch	him and i hoped ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's	clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't	make any move to.	5.182584510716217
6776. lift don't shove h lift.	10.472119682746735
6777. i took him by the shoulders.	13.259204014700947
6778. his mouth fell open.	13.755309650718509
6779. the skin on his neck was tight.	8.976097203071156
6780. he	was cold all right.	11.78959997873465
6781. his mouth is open.	10.842351322615498
6782. he'll choke anyway.	7.446549074579478
6783. don't hold him like	that.	3.241817001227866
6784. put your arms around him.	13.30446831207734
6785. he was cold all right.	15.66991192537313
6786. i put my arm carefully around him.	14.85798969813128
6787. hans had	his fingers in the kid's mouth.	7.14162538120728
6788. now he'll choke for sure.	13.476598103985157
6789. just hold him like i told you.	9.061030907176157
6790. he	was cold all right and wet.	9.818077947137997
6791. i had my arm behind his back.	13.3048514052684
6792. he was in his mid-fifties at this time long past the establishment of	his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again and it was almost	a decade since he had sworn off lecturing.	8.746944037200153
6793. there was never a doubt	any more how his structures would be received; it was always the same	unqualified success now.	7.429502728124805
6794. he could no longer build anything whether	a private residence in his pennsylvania county or a church in brazil	without it being obvious that he had done it and while here and there	he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique	they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the	public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time a quality	of authentic uniqueness about them which once established by an	artist as his private vision is no longer disputable as to its other	values.	6.140736773868429
6795. stowey rummel was internationally famous a crafter of a genuine	americana in foreign eyes an original designer whose inventive	childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere	by his personality.	4.595688357851942
6796. he had lived for almost thirty years in this	same stone farmhouse with the same wife a remarkably childish thing	in itself; he rose at half-past six every morning made himself some	french coffee had his corn flakes and more coffee smoked four cigarettes	while reading last sunday's herald tribune and yesterday's	pittsburgh gazette then put on his high-topped farmer's	shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop.	5.919517532269964
6797. this was an enormously	long building whose walls were made of rocks some of them brought	home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist.	6.44442733678189
6798. the debris of his other careers was piled everywhere; a pile of	wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying	on its side on the window sill vertical steel columns wired for support	to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting	out into the air masonry constructions on the floor from the time he	was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through	a whole house visible all the way up through wire gratings on each	floor.	5.9476694956723195
6799. his files desk drafting board and a high stool formed the only	clean island in the chaos.	6.004690791406951
6800. everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in	visible form: his models drawings ten-foot canvases in monochromes	from his painting days and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books	that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac.	5.882966537442573
6801. bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for	the camden cycly company plant hung on a rope in one corner and over	his desk next to several old and dusty hats was a clean pair of roller	skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house.	5.302255225111843
6802. he worked standing with his left hand in his pocket as though he	were merely stopping for a moment sketching with the surprised stare	of one who was watching another person's hand.	7.8575386127539195
6803. sometimes he would	grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him sometimes he would	look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved.	5.133585562479718
6804. it	all seemed- if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows-	as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler's	neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss's	work.	6.168300651441326
6805. this air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude	toward his things and people often mistook it for boredom in him	or a surrender to repetitious routine.	5.5438496513383875
6806. but he was not bored at	all;	he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite	wonderful that the world admired it and he could not imagine why he	should alter it.	9.483134156747699
6807. there are after all fortunate souls who hear everything	but only know how to listen to what is good for them and stowey	was as things go a fortunate man.	8.284188825283636
6808. he left his home the	day after new year's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and	without a hat.	8.182559825406509
6809. he would wear this same costume in florida despite his	wife cleota's reminders over the past five days that he must take	some cool clothes with him.	6.135728696008002
6810. but he was too busy to hear what she was	saying.	14.710936015887611
6811. so they parted when she was in an impatient humor.	10.681733428837203
6812. when he	was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon feeling in his trouser	cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before	she came out of the house with an enormous rumanian shawl over her	head which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad	and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window.	6.968499801360201
6813. finding	the key under his shoe he started the engine and while it warmed up	he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog and said defrost	the refrigerator.	5.465123969129898
6814. he saw the surprise in her face and	laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen.	10.721282225594019
6815. he kept on laughing until she started laughing with him.	8.372447987542277
6816. he had a deep	voice which was full of good food she had cooked and good humor;	an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it.	8.173772517827262
6817. he would	settle himself into his seat to laugh.	9.492848836661834
6818. whenever he laughed it was	all he was doing.	9.294885563980085
6819. and she was made to fall in love with him again there	in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog mad as she was	at his going away when he really didn't have to mad at their both	having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a	week to go by.	6.197137442852012
6820. she was forty-nine at this time a lanky woman of breeding	with an austere narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple	or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn	sort of prayer.	7.405492059822793
6821. her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two	lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair	that fell to her shoulders.	5.2303328878888795
6822. there was an air of blindness in her	gray eyes the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women	who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from	money-making and which besides has kept its estate intact.	7.954484394700085
6823. she was	personally sloppy and when she had colds would blow her nose in the	same handkerchief all day and keep it soaking wet dangling from her	waist and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves.	5.017791294344189
6824. but just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood	she would disappear and come down bathed brushed and taking	breaths of air and even with her broken nails her hands would come to	rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy a grace of history	so to speak and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she	was and adamant on certain questions of personal value.	5.90364473666416
6825. she even spoke	differently when she was clean and she was clean now for his departure	and her voice clear and rather sharp.	6.254019998775755
6826. now drive carefully	for god's sake! she called trying to attain a half humorous	resentment at his departure.	7.569827439210039
6827. but he did not notice and was already	backing the car down to the road saying toot-toot! to the	stump of a tree as he passed it the same stump which had impaled the	car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to	have removed.	6.263806890633113
6828. she stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until	he had swung the car onto the road.	7.735353964671092
6829. then when he had it pointed	down the hill he stopped to gaze at her through the window.	7.110244040182915
6830. she had	begun to turn back toward the house but his look caught her and she stood	still waiting there for what his expression indicated would be	a	serious word of farewell.	6.897141359880381
6831. he looked at her out of himself she thought	as he did only for an instant at a time the look which always surprised	her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and	his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs the look of the	gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the tate	gallery on a thursday once.	4.818928217199259
6832. now she kept herself protectively ready	to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger	and said toot! once more and roared off into the fog his foot	evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed	the accelerator just as his hand did when he worked.	6.179830300781557
6833. she walked back	to the house and entered feeling herself returning sensing some kind	of opportunity in the empty building.	6.245786901275279
6834. there is a death in all partings	she knew and promptly put it out of her mind.	13.772543502275504
6835. she enjoyed	great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking	all night but it always seemed to her that being alone especially	alone in her house was the realest part of life.	4.86016344972539
6836. now she could let out	the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that stowey	would let them out one of the doors; she could dust the plants	then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the	middle	on; improvise cha-chas on the harp; and finally the best part of	all simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine	and the newspapers reading the ads as well as the news registering	nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing	and desire.	5.914171464642024
6837. she did this now comfortably aware of the mist running	down the windows of the silence outside of the dark afternoon	it was getting to be.	6.444017385824623
6838. she fell asleep leaning on her hand hearing the	house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own	these two hundred years hearing the birds rustling in their cages and	the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and	walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm.	6.932039328444628
6839. every	few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things: stowey	yes was on his way south and the two boys were away in school and	nothing was burning on the stove and lucretia was coming for dinner	and bringing three guests of hers.	5.66232850576172
6840. then she fell asleep again as soddenly	as a person with fever and when she awoke it was dark outside	and the clarity was back in her eyes.	7.004972375297665
6841. she stood up smoothing her hair	down straightening her clothes feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping	darkness outside and above everything else for the absence of	the need to answer to respond to be aware even of stowey coming in	or going out and yet now that she was beginning to cook she glimpsed	a future without him a future alone like this and the pain made her	head writhe and in a moment she found it hard to wait for lucretia	to come with her guests.	4.888017488047787
6842. she went into the living room and turned on	three lamps then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling	light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn illuminating	the driveway.	7.487256537574229
6843. she knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at	herself.	8.016135679245236
6844. they were both so young after all so unready for any final	parting.	10.153904835156522
6845. how could it have been thirty years already she wondered?	9.946414923127234
6846. 	but yes nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine and she was forty-nine	and she had been married at nineteen.	7.407200254504526
6847. she stood still over the leg	of lamb rubbing herbs into it quite suddenly conscious of a nausea	in her stomach and a feeling of wrath a sensation of violence that started	her shivering.	5.449567098792145
6848. but they all said no your time will come.	12.932988752408587
6849. enjoy being a	bride while you can.	7.622507342753323
6850. there was no room for company in the	tiny weaning house	.	17.419875041649938
6851. so when the	big house filled up and ran over the sisters-in-law found beds for	everyone in their own homes.	6.080079841128008
6852. and there was still not anything that linda	kay could do.	18.118936673415206
6853. so linda kay gave up asking and accepted	her reprieve.	7.819574399789055
6854. without saying so she was really grateful; for to	attend the dying was something she had never experienced and certainly	had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as bobby	joe's wife.	6.604466668160244
6855. she had made curtains for all the windows of her	little house and she had kept it spotless and neat shabby as it was	and cooked good meals for bobby joe.	5.9507333613043345
6856. she had done all the things she	had promised herself she would do but she had not thought of this.	8.2710322007887
6857. people died she would have said in hospitals or in cars on the highway	at night.	7.086070814902075
6858. bobby joe was gone all day now not coming in	for dinner and sometimes not for supper.	7.13471672334233
6859. when they first married he	had been working in the fields all day and she would get in the car and	drive to wherever he was working to take him a fresh hot meal.	5.9988379236622515
6860. now	there was no work in the fields nor would there be till it rained	and she did not know where he went.	7.70656776826014
6861. not that she complained or had any	cause to.	10.01716488234422
6862. four or five of the cousins from east texas were about	his age so naturally they ran around together.	8.299933890678997
6863. there was no reason	for her to ask what they did.	12.87996220540548
6864. thus a new pattern of days began	to develop for granny albright did not die.	8.241026551972194
6865. she lay still on the	bed her head hardly denting the pillow; sometimes she opened her eyes	and looked around and sometimes she took a little milk or soup.	5.117710496397998
6866. they	stopped expecting her to die the next minute but only in the next	day or two.	7.7214005236442445
6867. those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would	not go home for she might die any time; but they might as well	unpack their suitcases for she might linger on.	5.578224435932913
6868. so the pattern	was established.	19.58631108443702
6869. when linda kay had put up her breakfast dishes	and mopped her linoleum rugs she would go to the big house.	6.592125785887085
6870. there	was not anything she could do there but that was where everyone was	or would be.	8.22369562370063
6871. bobby joe and the boys would come by say how's granny?	7.323653460371755
6872. 	and sit on the porch a while.	9.963603971793237
6873. the older men would be there	at noon and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off	to the creek or drove down the road towards town.	5.640018817921472
6874. the women and	children stayed at the albrights'.	14.484267452670649
6875. the women keeping their voices	low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room sounded	like chickens shut up in a coop for the night.	7.153402308961435
6876. the children had to	play away from the house	to maintain a proper quietness.	11.20204283053797
6877. off and on all day someone	would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything.	5.942878165509942
6878. the evaporative cooler had been moved to granny's room and	her door was kept shut; so that the rest of the house stayed open	though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that	way.	9.538774782857526
6879. the dust clogged their throats and the heat parched them	so that the women were always making ice water.	5.973289908963735
6880. they had cleaned	up an old ice box and begun to buy fifty-pound blocks of ice in town	as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for	the crowds who ate and drank there.	6.587275575156894
6881. one afternoon as the women	sat clucking softly a new carload of people pulled up at the gate.	6.970186086156762
6882. it was a cadillac black grayed with the dust of the road its windows	closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would	be cool and unwrinkled.	10.007235589995753
6883. they were an old fat couple	a thick middle-aged man and a girl about	ten or twelve.	8.608643088383149
6884. there was much embracing much exclaiming.	23.14879281618022
6885. cousin	ada! cousin john! cousin lura! cousin	howard! and how is she?	6.210871206873012
6886.  about the same john	about	the same.	20.25898015015805
6887. all the women got up and offered their chairs and	when they were all seated again the guests made their inquiries and	their explanations.	6.005341328667268
6888. we were on our vacation in canada	howard explained in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming	and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home.	8.150408308420957
6889. we came on as soon as we could.	11.723587693351124
6890. there was the suggestion	of ice water and- in spite of the protest we're not really	thirsty- linda kay to escape the stuffy air and the smothering	soft voices hurried to the kitchen.	9.60498030161256
6891. she filled a big pitcher	and set it with glasses on a tray.	6.897938509958291
6892. carrying it to the living room	she imagined the picture she made: tall and roundly slim a bit sophisticated	in her yellow sheath with a graceful swingy walk that she	had learned as a twirler with the school band.	6.213914308470507
6893. almost immediately she	was ashamed of herself for feeling vain at such a time in such a	place and she tossed back her long yellow hair smiling shyly as she	entered the room.	5.146687488536666
6894. howard was looking	at her.	12.886172342385436
6895. she felt the look and looked back because she could not help	it seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first	believed.	5.636923843793688
6896. and who is this?	19.008529318983225
6897.  he asked when she passed	him a glass.	11.642040994070069
6898. oh that's linda kay mama albright	said fondly.	10.398550832016166
6899. she married our baby boy bobby joe this summer.	7.953336273174813
6900. let's see cousin ada said.	8.70709923209007
6901. he's a right smart	younger than the rest?	4.083701913049093
6902.    oh yes mama laughed.	13.980946987867025
6903. he's	ten years younger than ernest.	8.254441635698543
6904. we didn't expect him to come	along; thought for the longest he was a tumor.	9.900093425449526
6905. this joke	was not funny to linda kay and she blushed as she always did;	then hearing the muffled boom of howard's laughter blushed redder.	5.39111182530187
6906. who is howard anyway?	20.959858232557675
6907.  she asked bobby joe that	night.	15.373309664084495
6908. oh he's a second	cousin or something.	11.252693535139658
6909. he got in the oil business out at odessa and	lucked into some money.	8.420684406861074
6910. how old is he?	19.994162347570644
6911.    gosh	i don't know.	10.363724110347151
6912. he's been married and	got this half-grown kid.	4.608368136559891
6913. if he bothers you don't pay him any mind.	9.898318812433429
6914. he's just a big windbag.	5.595483745498976
6915. bobby joe was thinking about something	else.	8.497094997205483
6916. say did you know they're fixing to have a two-day antelope	season on the double x?	7.705833033604787
6917.    he was talking about antelope	again when they woke up.	11.571320613486638
6918. listen i never had a chance to	kill an antelope.	8.422944613143244
6919. there never was a season before but now they want	to thin 'em out on account of the drouth.	7.307594276657645
6920. did he ever	visit here when he was a kid?	13.720042530562791
6921.  linda kay asked.	10.363724110347151
6922. when he	was a kid i wasn't around.	12.456038077993659
6923. bobby joe took a gun from behind	the door and with a quick bye now was gone for the day.	5.87826072345432
6924. almost immediately howard and his daughter debora drove up in	the cadillac.	8.661922653614251
6925. we're going after ice howard said	and	thought maybe you'd go along and keep us company.	4.653302588524281
6926. there	was really no reason to refuse and linda kay had never ridden in	a cadillac.	8.831185588445088
6927. driving along the caliche-topped road to town howard	talked.	6.764147616291221
6928. finally he said tell me about yourself and linda	kay told him because she thought herself that she had had an interesting	life.	8.395658057090843
6929. she was such a well-rounded teenager having been a twirler	future farmers sweetheart and secretary of future homemakers.	6.481409197065396
6930. in her sophomore year she had started going steady with bobby joe	who was a football player future homemakers sweetheart and president	of future farmers.	7.680722899132473
6931. it was easy to see that they were made for	each other and they knew what they wanted.	11.110792453076751
6932. bobby joe would be a senior	this year and he planned to graduate.	9.312413161111069
6933. but there was no need for	linda kay to go on since all she wanted in life was to make a home	for bobby joe and raise his children.	8.811925196751112
6934. you lucky kids he said.	17.055565169455456
6935. i'd give anything if i could	have found a girl like you.	4.645254661676125
6936. then he told linda kay about himself.	13.301785224704144
6937. of course he couldn't say much really because of debora but	linda kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and	what a raw deal he had got.	5.997204080208145
6938. it made her feel different about howard.	17.535100506371556
6939. she was going to tell bobby joe about how mistaken she had	been but he brought one of the cousins home for supper and all they	did was talk about antelope.	6.139956051357539
6940. bobby joe was trying to get linda	kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home.	6.871983869225636
6941. cook	a whole antelope?	10.363724110347151
6942.  she exclaimed.	24.46901042456472
6943. why i couldn't even cook	a piece of antelope steak; i never even saw any.	7.053168112774695
6944. i want to roast the whole thing and have it for the boys.	12.508054863868324
6945. linda kay told him he couldn't do anything like that	with his grandma dying and he said well they had to eat didn't	they they weren't all dying.	5.390365733530076
6946. linda kay felt like going off to the	bedroom to cry; but they were going up to the big house after supper	and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little.	7.226216121785413
6947. every night they all went to mama and papa albright's and	sat on the open front porch where they could get the breeze.	5.996833532873085
6948. it was	full-of-the-moon and nearly light as day.	14.718704829380005
6949. they all	sat around and drank ice water and the men smoked and everybody had	a good time.	7.197788518997553
6950. once in a while they said what a shame it was with granny	dying but they all agreed she wouldn't have wanted it any other	way.	6.966389497439894
6951. that night the older men got to talking about going possum-hunting	on a moonlight night.	6.6030488920030255
6952. bobby joe and two or three of the	other boys declared they had never been possum-hunting and uncle bill	farnworth said he would	just get	up from there and take them right then.	6.8277815033976825
6953. after they	had left some of the people moved around to find more comfortable places	to sit.	8.143287448363308
6954. there were not many chairs so that some preferred to sit	on the edge of the porch resting their feet on the ground and others	liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall.	9.496986086569983
6955. howard	who had been sitting against the wall said he needed more fresh air	and took the spot on the edge of the porch where bobby joe had been	sitting.	6.27934383476266
6956. you'll be a darn sight more comfortable there howard	ernest said laughing and they all laughed.	4.902261458975937
6957. linda	kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable.	8.362091338920917
6958. bobby joe had	been sitting close to her touching her actually and holding her hand	from time to time but it seemed at once that howard sat much closer.	6.577475917772968
6959. perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh so that more of	it seemed to come in contact with hers; but she had never been so aware	of anyone's flesh before.	5.947176692947406
6960. still she was not sorry he sat	by her but in fact was flattered.	8.557308006597403
6961. he had become the center of the	company such stories he had to tell.	12.323075216206048
6962. he had sold oil stock to bob hope	and bing crosby in person; he had helped fight an oil-well fire	that raged six days and nights.	7.489390904783603
6963. but tell me doctor where do you plan to conduct the hatching?	8.790448287834161
6964. 	alex asked.	15.594944937291627
6965. that will have to be in the hotel	the doctor retorted confirming alex's anticipations.	13.339168746124772
6966. what i	want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning	and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel.	9.92256008247251
6967. the doctor paid	the bill and they repaired to the hotel room number nine to initiate	alex further into these undertakings.	6.004245600770348
6968. the doctor opened	the smallest of his cases an unimposing straw bag and exposed the contents	for alex's inspection.	7.48837548295765
6969. inside carefully packed in straw	were six eggs but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect	what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside; to alex	they were merely six not unusual hens' eggs.	4.753980672708149
6970. there was little enough	time to contemplate them however; in an instant the doctor was stalking	across the room with an antique ledger in his hands thoroughly	eared and big as a table top.	0.0
6971. he placed it on alex's lap.	10.776005861178222
6972. this is my hen ledger he informed him in an absorbed way.	11.795441673654961
6973. it's	been going since 1908 when i was a junior in college.	7.543414615345915
6974. that first	entry there is the vermont flumenophobe the earliest and one of	the most successful of my eighty-three varieties- great big scapulars	and hardly any primaries at all.	7.42322956835561
6975. couldn't take them near a river	though or they'd squawk like a turkey cock the day before thanksgiving.	5.6622401711285315
6976. the ledger was full of most precise information:	date of laying length of incubation period number of chicks reaching	the first week second week fifth week weight of hen size of rooster's	wattles and so on all scrawled out in a hand that looked more	chinese than english the most jagged and sprawling alex had ever seen.	0.0
6977. below these particulars was a series of alpha-beta-gammas connected	by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed.	5.859593608464831
6978. alex's	instruction was rapid for the doctor had to go off to the rue	ecole de medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip	of wine to sustain him through them all.	6.292204623146848
6979. but after the doctor's return	that night alex could see from the high window in his own room	the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels	apparently giving its egg-hatching powers one final chance before it	was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen.	5.002342796230763
6980. a knocking at	alex's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning.	8.40106343233402
6981. it	was the doctor dressed and ready for the expedition to the market and	alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste.	5.754749454823204
6982. the doctor stood about	waiting for alex to dress with a show of impatience and soon they	were moving as quietly as could be through the still-dark hallways	past the bedroom of the patronne and so into the street.	6.140179798670089
6983. the	market was not far and once there the doctor's sense of immediacy	left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him.	5.971493682438109
6984. he stroked the hens and they responded with delighted clucks he gobbled	with the turkeys and they at once were all attention he quacked	with the ducks and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese.	6.550881477319316
6985. the dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be	done with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery.	5.717830135280216
6986. it was a fine broody hen white with a maternal eye and a striking	abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen.	8.795568672602469
6987. the doctor	with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope	drew alex's attention to those excellences which might otherwise	have escaped him: the fine color in comb and wattles the length and	quality of neck and saddle hackles the firm wide spread of the	toes and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets.	5.021760279666887
6988. all search	was ended; he had found his fowl.	12.170269904512773
6989. the purchase was effected and	they made their way towards the hotel again the hen with whom some	sort of communication had been set up nestling in the doctor's arms.	5.364479963628531
6990. the clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel	entrance; and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still	be abed began to rise in alex's well exercised breast.	6.843256951473382
6991. the doctor	was wearing a long new england greatcoat hardly necessary in the	june weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration	of hens.	5.438015056822804
6992. alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who	for all his care manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where	the hen was cradled.	7.081249537567031
6993. they advanced in a line across the entrance	hall	to the stairway and up with gingerly steps towards the first landing.	6.412212961893886
6994. it was then that they heard the tread of one descending and in	some perturbation glancing up saw the patronne coming towards them	as they gained the landing.	7.975928295688189
6995. bonjour messieurs vous etes	matinals she greeted them pleasantly.	6.764147616291221
6996. alex explained that they had	been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around	behind him attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind	alex's arm and back.	6.069938808981894
6997. vous voulez vos petits dejeuners	tout de suite alors?	6.764147616291221
6998.  their hostess enquired.	15.362618498979483
6999. alex told her that	there was no hurry for their breakfasts trying at the same time to	effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him.	5.732163109959642
7000. the	doctor he noticed was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs	but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible	cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well.	6.176221090178761
7001. eyes swerved	in the patronne's head alex coughed loudly and the doctor	with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him took to the stairs	in long-shanked leaps.	4.76581317220898
7002. comment?	19.804021762487697
7003.  ejaculated the surprised	woman looking at alex for an explanation but he parting from	her without ceremony only offered a few words about the doctor's	provincial american speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands	of his work.	4.931921471847684
7004. with that he hurried up the stairs followed by her	suspicious	gaze.	11.447520789041324
7005. when alex entered his room the doctor was already	preparing a nest in the straw case six eggs ready for the hen's	attentions.	5.924323904935415
7006. there was no reference to the incident on the stairs his	powers being absorbed by this more immediate business.	11.363913524196807
7007. the hen appeared	to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down	to the performance of them.	6.18023853477841
7008. one part of her audience was totally engaged	the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some	ancient classic the other part the guest of the connoisseur attentive	as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does	not fully understand.	6.268246377928917
7009. the spectacle progressed towards a denouement which	was obviously still remote; the audience attended.	6.578982329721101
7010. time elapsed	but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome	knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature.	6.995133281276191
7011. startled	he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view and alex went to the	door.	5.326519577128725
7012. he opened it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling	coughing and scraping noise as possible in order to drown emanations	from the hen who had begun to protest.	8.054071372217221
7013. it was giselle the fille de	chambre come to clean the room and while she stood before him with	ears pricked up and regard all curiosity explaining her errand alex	could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could	to calm the displeased bird.	5.252484703793126
7014. giselle was reluctant but alex succeeded	in persuading her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut	again.	6.849584171661778
7015. who was that young feller?	10.967932821297548
7016.  the doctor instantly	asked.	18.83174821599479
7017. that was the fille de chambre the one you thought	couldn't get the eggs out.	8.162963719205338
7018. she looked mighty interested though.	14.140224473190667
7019. anyhow she's coming back in five minutes to do the room.	6.762033368110939
7020. the doctor's mind was working at a great speed; he rose to put	his greatcoat on and addressed alex in a muted voice.	6.852952259467768
7021. have	you got our keys handy?	8.254441635698543
7022.    right in my pocket.	12.256142946775988
7023. now you go outside and beckon me when it's safe.	8.064529437540246
7024. the hall was empty and alex beckoned; they climbed the stairs	which creaked very loudly to their sensitive ears and reached the next	floor.	6.852952259467768
7025. a guest was locking his room; they passed behind him and	got to alex's room unnoticed.	6.046198409504693
7026. the doctor sat down rather wearily	caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a	poultry-loving man but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this	door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more.	6.560037376771768
7027. at	the door alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille	de chambre to return in ten minutes.	6.40953206835194
7028. it was evident that a second	transfer had to be effected and that it had to take place between the	time the fille finished the doctor's room and the time she began	alex's.	9.619418468268432
7029. they waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe;	the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine	and listened at the door.	5.234490859602089
7030. a bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows	being arranged indicated the fille de chambre's presence inside;	they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced	another important fact.	6.357269695967358
7031. the doctor shot down to the lavatory and turned	the doorknob but to no effect: the lavatory was occupied.	6.31321246852747
7032. although	a look of alarm passed over his face he did not arrest his movements	but disappeared into the shower room just as the chambermaid emerged	from number nine.	6.765085040042948
7033. alex suppressed those expressions of relief which	offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat; unwarranted	they were in any case for as he stood facing the fille de chambre	his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower	room.	4.496029917999484
7034. the events of the last quarter of an hour mysterious to	any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard	had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series of cackly wails	perhaps mourning her nest but briefly enjoyed.	7.513978511632348
7035. the doctor's	wits had not left him however for all his sixty-eight years and the	wails were almost immediately lost in the sound of water rushing out	from the showerhead.	6.321539925873991
7036. alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual	were taking place and entered the doctor's room.	6.757567981697296
7037. shortly the doctor	himself entered his hair somewhat wet from the shower but evidently	satisfied with the outcome of their adventures.	5.918346290698653
7038. without comment he	opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a highboard around	the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside.	8.475630139077994
7039. next the hen	was nested and all seemed well.	7.967695991516322
7040. the two men sat for some time savoring	the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings	before they got up and left the hotel the doctor to go to the conference	house and alex to go to the main post office.	8.266475035918859
7041. alex returned	to the hotel rather weary and with no new prospects of a role	in the late afternoon but found the doctor in an ebullient mood.	4.816916840050745
7042. at	the time alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication	with the hen who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully	after the occurrences of the morning.	6.7008710318578695
7043. chickens have short	memories the doctor remarked that's why they are better company	than most people i know and he went on to break some important	news to alex.	5.873327951994046
7044. well he began it seems like some people	in paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference	house do.	7.151335066351274
7045. they've got a big vulture from tanganika at the	zoo here with a wife for him too very rare birds both of them the	only vulturidae of their species outside africa.	4.309046847042791
7046. seems like	she's	willing but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy	who took jeannie may behind the barn and then didn't know what to	do and the people at the zoo haven't got any vulture chicks to show	for their trouble.	6.241463387994444
7047. going downstairs with the tray winston wished he could have	given in to miss ada but he knew better than to do what she said when	she had that little-girl look.	5.371194053852711
7048. there were times it wasn't right	to make a person happy like the times she came in the kitchen and asked	for a peanut butter sandwich.	9.175970892326326
7049. you know we don't keep peanut butter	in this house he always told her.	8.18506774744492
7050. why winston she'd	cry i just now saw you eating it out of the jar! but he	knew how important it was for her to keep her figure.	7.825764480774801
7051. in the	kitchen leona his little young wife was reading the morning paper.	7.415783281064617
7052. her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool.	8.018407330783146
7053. here winston said gently what's these dishes doing not	washed?	8.291947986180384
7054.  the enormous plates which had held mr jack's four	fried eggs and five strips of bacon were still stacked in the sink.	7.243051271850887
7055. leave me alone leona said.	8.587897212087949
7056. can't you see i'm	busy?	11.568363037656766
7057.  she looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper.	8.896731147102988
7058. this is moving day winston reminded her and i bet	you left things every which way upstairs your clothes all over the	floor and the bed not made.	7.549223808848393
7059. leona! his eye had fastened on her	leg; bending he touched her knee.	5.825820622377272
7060. if i catch you one more time	down here without stockings-   she twitched her leg away.	9.708956332474669
7061. she had an alley cat's manners.	12.955047626087975
7062. winston stacked miss ada's thin pink dishes in the sink.	7.879513779734377
7063. then he	spread out the last list on the counter.	7.72124805359566
7064. to be left behind	was printed at the top in miss ada; fine hand.	11.543011341710196
7065. winston took out	a pencil admired the point and wrote slowly and heavily clothes	stand.	5.9324003884465775
7066. sighing leona dropped the paper and stood up.	9.139614368306562
7067. i	guess i better get ready to go.	8.529796625996704
7068. winston watched her fumbling	to untie her apron.	9.060328853487057
7069. carefully he undid the bow.	8.254441635698543
7070. how come your bows is always cockeyed?	11.436703851707046
7071.    she turned and	put her arms around his neck.	9.004732673333839
7072. i don't want to leave here winston.	6.118587703680254
7073. he drew back embarrassed	and pleased.	12.127026643485452
7074. i thought you was sick to death of this big house.	10.3211144282129
7075. said	you wore yourself out cleaning all these empty rooms.	6.460370037324521
7076. at	least there is room here she said.	9.427461338981978
7077. what room is there going	to be in an apartment for any child?	7.051663718466665
7078.    i told you what	miss ada's doctor said.	16.556151633016437
7079. i don't mean miss ada!	what you think i care about that?	4.622066639806156
7080.  i mean our children.	20.334887109296098
7081. she	sounded as though they already existed.	9.244711987756071
7082. in spite of the hundred	things he had on his mind winston went and put his arm around her	waist.	10.847529689674804
7083. we've got plenty of time to think about that.	6.185979655746994
7084. all the	time in the world.	13.821446840433715
7085. we've only been married four years january.	5.225159000530055
7086. that's a long time waiting.	6.936104236715188
7087. how many times have i told you- he began and	was almost glad when she cut him off- too many times!-	and flounced to the sink where she began noisily to wash her hands.	4.8772260552564894
7088. too many times was the truth of it winston thought.	11.313442901891205
7089. he hardly	believed his reason himself any more.	9.783357976961607
7090. although it had seemed a good	reason to begin with: no couple could afford to have children.	9.068634261267668
7091. how you going to work with a child hanging on you?	9.449129124049907
7092.  he asked	leona.	27.770505909397876
7093. you want to keep this job don't you?	11.667005738364118
7094.  he doubted	whether she heard him over the running water.	11.500547313047392
7095. he sat for a	while with his hands on his knees watching the bend of her back as she	gathered up her things- a comb a bottle of aspirin- to take upstairs	and pack.	5.312529672630682
7096. she made him sad some days and he was never sure why;	it was something to do with her back the thinness of it and the	quick jerky way she bent.	8.092335934182634
7097. she was too young that was all; too young	and thin and straight.	8.513285062385096
7098. winston!   it was mr	jack bellowing out in the hall.	9.68862676367082
7099. winston hurried through the swinging	door.	8.254441635698543
7100. i've been bursting my lungs for you mr jack	complained.	5.255920864658871
7101. he was standing in front of the mirror tightening his tie.	12.349416925544872
7102. he had on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat and his brief	case lay on the bench.	9.447875346781824
7103. i don't know what you think you've been	doing about my clothes he said.	4.56232808997252
7104. this coat looks like a rag heap.	13.495648595767976
7105. there were a few blades of lint on the shoulder.	13.068214159382418
7106. winston	took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work.	8.812033626439662
7107. he gave mr	jack a real going-over; he brushed his shoulders and his back	and his collar with long firm strokes.	6.415827801046271
7108. hey! mr jack cried	when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes.	7.198778874655976
7109. winston	apologized and quickly set the hat right.	7.14162538120728
7110. then he stood back to look	at mr jack who was pulling on his pigskin gloves.	8.600653985599752
7111. winston enjoyed	seeing him start out; he wore his clothes with style.	6.002446559592496
7112. when he was	going to town nothing was good enough- he had cursed at winston	once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace.	7.736705781836891
7113. at home he wouldn't	even wash his hands for supper and he wandered around the yard	in a pair of sweaty old corduroys.	6.55616141136686
7114. the velvet smoking jackets pearl-gray	wine and blue which miss ada had bought him hung brushed and	unworn in the closet.	7.19406632878046
7115. good-by winston mr jack said	giving a final set to his hat.	6.002446559592496
7116. look out for those movers!	winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car; a handsome	fine-looking man it made him proud to see.	7.444456021689191
7117. after mr jack	drove away winston went on looking out the window.	7.291519037757386
7118. he noticed a speck	of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger.	8.26265427207832
7119. then he looked	at his finger at the wrinkled heavy knuckle and the thick nail he	used like a knife to pry up slit and open.	5.590955893806956
7120. for the first time he	let himself be sad about the move.	15.491689082538887
7121. that house was ten years off his life.	10.913309268090375
7122. each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward and he knew how	to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long	glass drops which hung from the chandelier.	6.606898567551556
7123. he knew the house like	a blind man through his fingers and he did not like to think of all	the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up.	6.832487749526166
7124. ten years	ago he had come to the house to be interviewed.	16.87468417619587
7125. the tulips and the	big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive and he had walked	up from the bus almost singing.	5.963667560753913
7126. miss ada had been out back in a straw	hat planting flowers.	8.430425115209394
7127. she had talked to him right there with the	hot sun in his face which made him sweat and feel ashamed.	6.579313061269457
7128. winston	had been surprised at her for that.	9.060328853487057
7129. still he had liked the way she	had looked in a fresh neat cotton dress- citron yellow if he remembered.	5.545554099726889
7130. she had had a dignity about her even barefoot and almost too	tan.	12.370175535536896
7131. since then the flowers she had planted had spread all	over the hill.	7.088283514516456
7132. already the jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front	gate and the periwinkles were coming on blue by the porch steps.	7.060238944614213
7133. in a week the hyacinths would spike out.	13.33869610192539
7134. and the dogwood in early	may for miss ada's alfresco party; and after that the japanese	cherries.	8.903824026993293
7135. now the yard looked wet and bald the trees bare under their	buds but in a while miss ada's flowers would bloom like a marching	parade.	5.947856845619089
7136. she had dug a hole for each bulb each tree wore a tag with	her writing on it; where would she go for her gardening now?	7.09783377706419
7137.  somehow	winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes.	6.764147616291221
7138. sighing	he hurried to the living room.	9.670406878971576
7139. he had a thousand things to see	to.	13.88368757519947
7140. still he couldn't help thinking we're all getting old getting	small; the snail is pulling in her horns.	7.30773626570091
7141. in the living	room miss ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in	her hand.	7.058889647279377
7142. she was looking out at the garden.	16.46500214997183
7143. winston	she said get the basket for the breakables.	6.764147616291221
7144. winston had	the big straw basket ready in the hall.	8.196044167676531
7145. he brought it in and put	it down beside her.	8.431773034471274
7146. miss ada was looking fine; she had on her easter	suit blue with lavender binding.	7.654154879681012
7147. halfway across the house he	could have smelled her morning perfume.	6.210871206873012
7148. it hung in all her day clothes	sweet and strong; sometimes when he was pressing winston raised	her dresses to his face.	8.73241798778693
7149. frowning miss ada studied the list.	7.622507342753323
7150. the china lemon tree.	15.841500723885778
7151. winston followed her around the room collecting the small frail	objects and wrapping them	in tissue paper.	5.693671129038469
7152. neither of them trusted the movers.	13.115645452062768
7153. when they	came to mr jack's photograph twenty by twelve inches in a curly	silver frame miss ada said by rights i ought to leave that	seeing he won't take my clotheshorse.	5.303954335921686
7154. she smiled at winston	and he saw the hateful hard glitter in her eyes.	9.34342916675836
7155. he picked up the photograph	and began to wrap it.	10.491114131903798
7156. at least you could leave it	for the movers miss ada said.	10.935937874895334
7157. what possessed you to tell me	a clotheshorse would be a good idea?	8.625533737127238
7158.    winston folded the	tissue paper carefully.	10.472119682746735
7159. he's used it every day; every morning	i lay out his clothes on it.	3.9522364315259604
7160. and it was his main present! leave that fool picture out she added	sharply.	12.38490716874011
7161. winston laid it in the basket.	9.474431667093892
7162. mr jack sets	store by that.	13.219971295917068
7163. it was meant to be	my present.	16.79056552587768
7164. but she went on down the list.	14.886931241401385
7165. winston was	relieved; those presents had been on his mind.	6.8220599338520485
7166. he had only agreed	with miss ada about getting the valet but he had actually suggested	the photograph to mr jack.	9.071523470121269
7167. you know what she likes winston	he had said wearily one evening in november when winston was	pulling off his overshoes.	7.07816376232753
7168. tell me what to get her for christmas.	9.32914914240057
7169. she's been talking about a picture winston had told	him.	5.687700428357345
7170. picture! you mean picture of me?	9.670406878971576
7171.  but winston	had persuaded him.	14.87752464115648
7172. on christmas night they had had a disagreement	about it.	13.185605086760198
7173. winston had heard because he was setting up the	liquor tray in the next room.	6.993468876630321
7174. through the door he had seen mr jack	walking around waiting for miss ada.	9.484563746536747
7175. finally she had come down;	winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk	hostess gown.	5.521509049452843
7176. how do you like it?	20.420114640013633
7177.  she had asked.	20.13874253045412
7178. mr jack had said you look about fifteen years old.	9.152799234301753
7179. is that a compliment?	16.66280321130808
7180.    i don't know.	8.280368894557514
7181. he had	stood at a little distance studying her as though he would walk around	next and look at the back of her head.	8.04813035667158
7182. lovie you make	me feel naked.	10.472119682746735
7183. miss ada had giggled and she went sweeping and rustling	to the couch and sank down.	5.881800495615735
7184. you look like that picture	i have at the office mr jack had started.	10.988768079641906
7185. not a line	not a wrinkle.	13.430434895335097
7186. i look like an old man compared and he had picked	up his photograph with the red christmas bow still on it.	8.473326102101499
7187. will you wear pink when you're sixty?	9.281641589034585
7188.    darling	i love that photograph.	11.568363037656766
7189. i'm going to put it on my dresser.	5.226955649389396
7190. i guess it's children make a woman old.	11.633205579815934
7191. a man gets	old anyhow.	16.470321985788654
7192. after a minute he went on people must think the	curse is on me seeing you fresh as an apple and me old and gray.	8.047975997820625
7193. i'll give you a medical certificate framed if you like	miss ada had said.	4.7578628874807825
7194. all i want is a picture- with	a few lines.	9.932085718729901
7195. make the man put them in if he has to.	7.552580674945524
7196. after	that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word.	8.113895148518498
7197. then miss	ada had stood up rustling and rustling and gone upstairs.	7.0054235509862846
7198. was it love?	24.82337925620855
7199.  i had no doubt that it was.	16.70899508880048
7200. during the rest of the summer	my scholarly mania for making plaster casts and spatter prints of	catskill flowers and leaves was all but surpassed by the constantly	renewed impressions of jessica that my mind served up to me for contemplation	and delight.	7.2713683788309895
7201. nothing in all the preceding years had	had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than	the breakup of camp the packing away of my camp uniforms the severing	of ties with the six or ten people i had grown most to love in the	world.	5.103871055821257
7202. in final separation from them in the railroad terminal across	the river from new york i would nearly cry.	9.352563111128934
7203. my parents' welcoming	arms would seem woeful inadequate unwanted.	7.487989836845301
7204. but that year was	different for just as the city in the form of my street clothes had	intruded upon my mountain nights so an essential part of the summer	gave promise of continuing into the fall: jessica and i about to	be separated not by a mere footbridge or messhall kitchen but by the	immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs had agreed	to correspond.	7.437949650643217
7205. these letters became the center of my existence.	10.503650902539228
7206. i lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock	myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth	time and finally prepare an answer.	7.576725122525901
7207. my memory has catalogued for easy	reference and withdrawal the image of her pink scented stationery and	the unsloped almost printed configurations of her neat studious handwriting	with which she invited me to recall our summer so many sentences	beginning with remember when h; and others concerning	camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood and news of her	commencing again her piano lessons her private school a visit to	boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned	on furlough wounded from the war in europe.	4.491536409138628
7208. in my letters	i took on a personality that differed from the self i knew in real	life.	9.572471516900004
7209. then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting	cables and communiques full of dash and wit and glamor quoting	from the books i read imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended	by a teacher in whose special after-school class i was enrolled.	4.693342183427144
7210. the letters took their source from a stream of my imagination	in which i was transformed into a young man not unlike my bunkmate eliot	sands- he of the porch steps anecdotes- who smoked cigarettes	performed the tango wore fifty dollar suits and sneaked off into	the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them.	6.019878378034352
7211. like eliot	in my fantasies i had a proud bearing and with a skill that was vaguely	continental i would lead jessica through an evening of dancing	and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits would guide her gently	to the night's climax which in my dreams was always represented	by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep moist kisses	burning with love.	4.642926399822628
7212. the night after reading her letter about her surgeon	uncle- it must have been late in september- i had a vision	of myself returned in ragged uniform from the front nearly dying	my head bandaged and blooded and jessica bending over me the power	of her love bringing me back to life.	6.5970873151254406
7213. for many nights afterward the	idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return	and fill me with obscure and painful desires would cause me to lie	awake in shame tossing with irresolution longing to fall into a deep	sleep.	5.190903971750025
7214. the weeks went by and the longer our separation grew	the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became.	7.333060553020843
7215. they	caused my love for jessica to become warmer and at the same time more	hopeless as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever	bring me the courage to ask to see her again.	5.920687781831919
7216. as it turned out	jessica took matters	into her own hands.	14.619791802999812
7217. having received permission	to give a camp reunion-halloween party she asked that i come and	be her date.	5.665689085444768
7218. i went and mum and nervous all but made a fool of myself.	9.19445295526662
7219. again among those jubilantly reunited bunkmates i was shy with	jessie and acted as i had during those early saturday mornings when	we all seemed to be playing for effect to be detached and unconcerned	with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom later in	the privacy of our bunks we would think in terms of the most elaborate	romance.	5.143702969203181
7220. i remember standing in a corner watching jessica act the	hostess serving soft drinks to her guests.	9.007150470468716
7221. she was wearing her dark	hair in two thick braids to attain an american girl effect	she thought was appropriate to halloween.	6.047270722152627
7222. it made her look sweet and	schoolgirlish i was excited to be with her but i did not know how	to express it.	9.384465159808828
7223. yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous	letter writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages out	of my mind and plant himself in reality.	5.4190536052477505
7224. it was late we were playing	kissing games and jessica and i were called on to kiss in front	of the others.	9.348663724990093
7225. we blushed and were flustered and it turned out to	be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek.	7.353254886939662
7226. the kiss outraged our friends	but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote exciting	premonitions of lust all the mysterious sensations that i had	imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me.	6.193800139130625
7227. it was	at that party that finally overcoming my timidity inspired by tales	only half-understood and overheard among older boys i asked jessie	to spend new year's eve with me.	5.571664541101915
7228. lovingly she accepted and so	great was my emotion that all i could think of saying was you're	amazing you know?	6.44893033609597
7229.  later we agreed to think of how we wished	to spend that night.	8.476132431116032
7230. we would write to one another and make a definite	plan.	15.456755412581593
7231. among my school and neighborhood	friends during the next months i bragged and swaggered and	pompously described my impending date.	5.959721212221881
7232. but though i boasted and gave	off a dapper front i was beneath it all frightened.	9.296960857358496
7233. it would be the	first time i had ever been completely alone with a girl i loved.	9.441209429837478
7234. i had no idea of what subjects one discussed when alone with a girl	or how one behaved: should i hold her hand while walking or only	when crossing the street?	7.618885669051951
7235.  should i bring along a corsage or send	one to her?	7.107326939158011
7236.  was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city?	11.567431167788708
7237. 	should i accompany her to the door of her home or should i ask to	be invited in?	6.285716992524844
7238.  in or out should i kiss her goodnight?	11.838405196350237
7239.  all this	was unknown to me and yet i had dared to ask her out for the most	important night of the year!   when in one letter jessica informed	me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone	on new year's eve i knew for a moment an immense relief; but	the letter went on: she had cried she had implored she had been miserable	at his refusal and finally he had relented- and now how happy	she was how expectant!   her optimism gave me heart.	4.605845061041317
7240. i forced	confidence into myself.	18.25917094604721
7241. i made inquiries i read a book of etiquette.	8.555241096529764
7242. in december i wrote her with authority that we would meet	on the steps of the hotel astor a rendezvous spot that i had learned	was the most sophisticated.	7.390797496237237
7243. we would attend a film and later on	i stated we might go to the mayflower coffee shop or child's	or toffenetti's for waffles.	6.55119013854694
7244. i set the hour of our meeting for seven.	11.640319748285755
7245. at five o'clock that night it was already dark and behind	my closed door i was dressing as carefully as a groom.	5.537746608358067
7246. i wore a new	double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design	and wide lapels like a devil's ears.	7.721756160345477
7247. my camp-made leather wallet bulky	with twisted raised stitches around the edges i stuffed with money	i had been saving.	5.449744428242049
7248. hatless in an overcoat of rough blue wool	i was given a proud farewell by my mother and father and i set out	into the strangely still streets of brooklyn.	5.907722020352733
7249. i felt superior to the	neighborhood friends i was leaving behind felt older than my years	and was full of compliments for myself as i headed into the subway that	was carrying its packs of passengers out of that dull borough and	into the unstable tantalizing excitement of manhattan.	4.929943984495948
7250. times	square when i ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers	dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant	was nearly impassable the sidewalks swarming with celebrants	with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls	and their rationed bottles of whiskey.	6.049553416921706
7251. heavy-coated severe-looking	policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the	revellers from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic.	6.376579619543275
7252. the night	was cold but the crowd kept one warm.	9.945332631078985
7253. the giant electric signs and	marquees were lit up for the first time since blackout regulations had	been instituted and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that	victory was just around the corner.	6.314418041128733
7254. cardboard noisemakers substitutes	for the unavailable tin models were being hawked and bought at makeshift	stands every few yards along broadway and one's ears were continually	serenaded by the horns' rasps and bleats.	5.830388127029086
7255. an old gentlemen	next to me held a boy scout bugle to his lips and blasted away at	every fourth step and during the interim shouted out v for victory!	his neighbors cheered him on.	4.9700804423364575
7256. there was a great sense of	camaraderie.	31.606683695908036
7257. how did one join them?	13.36332041789622
7258.  where were they all walking	to?	13.360187620899113
7259.  was i supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for jessica?	6.991827708813208
7260. 	it was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the	other gallants who had established the astor steps as the beach-head	from which to launch their night of merrymaking.	6.7435932932373515
7261. i looked over their	faces and felt a twinge: they all looked so much more knowing than	i.	6.620010315651452
7262. i looked for jessica to materialize out of the	clogging curdling crowd and as the time passed and i waited a fiend	came to life beside me and whispered in my ear: how was i planning	to greet jessica?	7.109580354536243
7263.  where exactly would we go after the movie?	8.1198227100694
7264. 	suppose the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we	couldn't get in?	9.121871304551341
7265.  suppose i hadn't brought along enough money?	8.412690051217616
7266. 	i felt for my wallet.	10.472119682746735
7267. its thick substantial outline calmed me.	8.534848014213438
7268. but when i saw that it was already ten past seven i began to	wonder if something had gone wrong.	10.38876243713645
7269. suppose her father had changed his	mind and had refused to let her leave?	7.97053187518695
7270.  suppose at this very moment	her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans?	8.783272136838821
7271. 	i grew uneasy.	10.363724110347151
7272. all about me there was a hectic interplay of meetings	taking place like abrupt jerky scenes in old silent movies joyous	greetings and beginnings huggings and kissings enthusiastic forays	into the festive night.	6.5902861150167915
7273. whole platoons were taking up new positions on	the steps arriving and departing while i stayed glued like a signpost	to one spot.	5.173581777093261
7274. at 7:25 two hotel doormen came thumping	down the steps carrying a saw-horse to be set up as a barricade in front	of the haberdashery store window next to the entranceway and as i	watched them in their gaudy red coats that nearly scraped the ground	their golden fringed epaulets and spic red-visored caps i suddenly	saw just over their shoulders jessica gracefully making her way through	the crowd.	6.077047881678066
7275. my heart almost stopped beating.	9.452730157081492
7276. there were thirty-eight patients on the bus the morning i left	for hanover most of them disturbed and hallucinating.	10.326232434812761
7277. an interne	a nurse and two attendants were in charge of us.	7.82909529942873
7278. i felt lonely	and depressed as i stared out the bus window at chicago's grim	dirty west side.	8.110994027349752
7279. it seemed incredible as i listened to the monotonous	drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients	that technically i was a ward of the state of illinois going to	a hospital for the mentally ill.	6.550898827914617
7280. i suddenly thought of mary	jane brennan the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger her quiet	competence the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the	surface of her defenses.	6.554246266652798
7281. we had become good friends during my	stay at cook county hospital.	8.455298144236355
7282. i had told her enough about myself	to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appeared in local newspapers	after my little adventure in marshall field + co.	7.2483989123024175
7283. she	knew that i lived at a good address on the gold coast that i had	once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university	to finish my medical studies.	5.055478394587346
7284. she knew also that i was unmarried	and without a single known relative.	9.768566603214257
7285. she wasn't quite sure that	i felt enough remorse about my drinking or that i would not return	to it once i was out and on my own again.	5.873972385632297
7286. i read those newspaper stories about you she had said.	10.227318669010717
7287. you	must have loved that girl very much but you couldn't have meant	it when you said that you wanted to kill her.	4.958070100322966
7288. why do you	say that?	15.604009980076775
7289.  i asked.	22.589978126100267
7290. i was full of booze and well a drunk	is apt to do anything he says he'll do.	9.800103582953502
7291. nonsense! i grew	up in an irish neighborhood on chicago's west side.	6.002446559592496
7292. don't	tell me about drunks.	11.568363037656766
7293. you're not the kind to go violent.	5.955381787546666
7294. were you	in love with that girl?	9.670406878971576
7295.    would it make any difference to	you if i were mary jane?	7.648640656989306
7296.    she met my eyes suddenly	angry.	14.140224473190667
7297. i wouldn't have gone into nursing if i didn't care about	people.	8.731200769840179
7298. i'm interested in every patient i've helped take care	of.	5.021813214007006
7299. when i think of people like you well i-   you	what mary jane?	8.28109017490717
7300.    you are young intelligent have a	whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself but	you mess it up with whiskey indifference self-destructive attitudes.	7.46194019252402
7301. i don't blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you.	4.837439468880398
7302. was	she pretty?	15.594944937291627
7303.    oh yes i said feeling annoyed	she was very pretty.	7.259083843395202
7304. you don't believe that i'm going back to	medical school and finish do you?	6.662951442449853
7305.    why	should i?	12.292407525564322
7306.  i've	worked this ward for three months now.	9.898201359108192
7307. we keep getting the same	ones back again and again.	8.396496230546957
7308. they all mean well have great promises to	make when they are about to go home but drinking is their sickness.	8.828791705064697
7309. you've not seemed like them but maybe you are.	4.754159599044218
7310. you've treated	your stay here like a big joke.	6.155703583967441
7311. it's not a joke to be sent to a place	like this or to hanover.	3.262234899347801
7312. i wanted to go to college to-	why didn't you?	19.138244682706073
7313.  i asked.	22.589978126100267
7314. chicago has some of the best-	her eyes flashed angrily.	12.699261672896
7315. that's what i mean about	you anderson she said.	4.449117988093786
7316. you don't seem to know much about	reality.	7.9866154966585166
7317. i'll tell you why i didn't go to college; i'm	the oldest of six children.	4.306458221738854
7318. my father's a policeman and makes less	than seven thousand dollars a year.	8.593155599986956
7319. there was no money for tuition	for clothes for all the things you apparently take for granted.	9.752535060191938
7320. nurses'	training here doesn't cost anything.	10.472119682746735
7321. they even pay me six dollars	a month.	9.433178351824823
7322. i think it's a good deal.	19.061703932371586
7323. i'm going to become a good	nurse and i've got two baby brothers that are going to have college	if i have to work at my profession until i'm an old maid to give	it to them.	5.205930138677754
7324. do you have a boy friend?	25.69009997943274
7325.  i asked.	22.589978126100267
7326. that's none of your business she said then changed	the subject.	5.199736669592963
7327. what about your father and mother don't you think	of them when you're in a place like this?	6.056470355713115
7328.    my father	and mother died when i was two years old i said.	8.903950950735569
7329. aunt mary died when i was doing my military service.	7.042724002063021
7330. i have	no one but myself to worry about.	11.633205579815934
7331. something in my voice must	have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly and she	turned away to keep me from seeing her face.	5.113818637254431
7332. i don't know what i'd do without my family.	5.695623658910755
7333. we've	always been so close.	9.118533821976325
7334. tell me more about them.	10.950229209308457
7335. her	eyes became bright as she talked about her father and mother aunts	and uncles cousins.	6.030195760983861
7336. listening i felt cheated and lonely as only an	orphan can.	7.879513779734377
7337. when she had finished i said:   your dad sounds	like a good father and a good policeman.	7.43177231671525
7338. i'll bet he wouldn't	be pleased if a rumdum like me were to ask his daughter for a date-	i mean after i'm out of the hospital a month or so from now.	5.637413546490539
7339. my father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached	to homicide for five years.	6.4841191986873
7340. he's a pretty good judge of character	anderson.	5.808701761804329
7341. i don't think he'd mind too much if he were sure you'd	decided not to be a rumdum in the future.	5.599205874991546
7342. what about	you?	25.95030532115391
7343.  how would you feel about it if i were to ask you for a date	when i get through at hanover?	5.841661077977858
7344.    if i thought you	were serious about going back to school that you'd learned something	from your experiences here and at hanover- well i might consider	such an offer.	7.454053693863141
7345. what about your h that girl you were going to kill?	9.248657990684244
7346. 	it suddenly seemed very important to me that mary jane	brennan should know the truth about me- that i was not the confused	sick irresponsible person she believed me to be.	7.124865490029955
7347. there	are things about me that i can't tell you now mary jane i	said but if you'll go out to dinner with me when i get out of hanover	i'd like to tell you the whole story.	5.6228636217059185
7348. i can say this: i'm	dead serious about going back to school.	11.440005227859416
7349. as for that other girl	let's just say that i never want to see her again.	7.855264028033953
7350. you will get	to come home on long weekends from hanover won't you?	11.250640737104604
7351. 	yes i'll get one overnight a month.	7.14162538120728
7352. we'll go up	to the edgewater beach hotel for dinner i said.	5.521386603555391
7353. do you like	to dance?	18.895468921462953
7354.  they always have a good orchestra.	15.335018908887587
7355. i like	to dance she said then turned and walked away.	8.061482068632769
7356. there hadn't	been anything really personal in her interest in me.	11.914636702031446
7357. it was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward	and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there.	7.9125009590122755
7358. now riding this hospital bus feeling isolated and utterly	alone i knew that she was genuine and unique quite unlike any girl	i had known before.	7.293939614551564
7359. it seemed the most important thing in my life	at this moment that she should know the real truth about me.	7.298067210569471
7360. it	was a fantastic story.	13.015750011366617
7361. only two people in the state of illinois knew	that i was entering hanover state hospital under an assumed name	or why.	7.770980778322675
7362. it was unlikely that any girl as sharp as mary jane brennan	would believe it without proof.	10.029381691140129
7363. but i had the proof all documented	in a legal agreement which i would show her the moment i was free	to do so.	6.708826325355364
7364. as the bus turned into the main highway and headed	toward hanover i settled back in my seat and closed my eyes thinking	over the events of the past two weeks trying to put the pieces in	order.	8.007048795882682
7365. i wondered suddenly as i listened to the disconnected jabberings	coming from the patient behind me if i had not perhaps imagined	it all.	7.545656539573926
7366. perhaps this was reality and dale nelson the actor was	delusion; a figment of carl anderson's imagination.	9.486324995618533
7367. i	had come to chicago from new york early in september with a dramatic	production called ask tony.	6.05069946055912
7368. it was a bad play real grade-a	turkey which only a prevalence of angels with grandiose dreams of	capital gain and tax money to burn could have put into rehearsal.	8.12402404419385
7369. no	one not even the producer had any real hope of getting it back to broadway.	6.661552216282131
7370. but because it was a suspense gangster story of the capone	era many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in chicago continue	as a road company and eventually become a movie.	8.920994007239832
7371. such optimism	was completely unjustified.	12.096196390257987
7372. the critics literally screamed their	indignation.	13.848082117783294
7373. ask tony was doomed from the moment kupcinet leveled	on it in his sun-times column.	6.7677922911648345
7374. we opened on friday and	closed the following monday.	11.399541947434118
7375. out of the entire cast i alone received	good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer.	8.213360293880044
7376. this let me	in for a lot of kidding from the rest of the company two members of	which were native chicagoans.	11.592493844958431
7377. we were paid off tuesday morning	and given tickets back to new york.	7.799141791309426
7378. i felt lonely and depressed	as i packed my bags at the croydon hotel.	8.923469128060672
7379. it seemed to me that	my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another.	10.615850701840195
7380. i	had been among the top third in my class at nyu had wanted	desperately to go to medical school but i'd run out of money and	energy at the same time.	7.199873736505148
7381. then later i had quit my safe secure five-a-week	spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play.	6.051672092450167
7382. it	seemed to me that i was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well.	10.112104656408526
7383. i	knew that i'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital	or as a counterman at union news or schraffts while waiting for another	acting job to open.	4.656645272807095
7384. it suddenly occurred to me that i did not particularly	like acting that i was at some sort of crossroads and would	have to decide soon what i was going to do with my life.	10.674653583826169
7385. i	closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy	to pick up then went to the bathroom for a drink of water.	5.587437315715598
7386. when i answered it a voice too dignified and british to	be real said is this mr dale nelson the actor?	8.047635658936887
7387. 	all right i said.	9.118533821976325
7388. why don't you bastards lay off for a	while?	10.476177451418131
7389.    i beg your pardon sir?	12.384361145835424
7390.    all right.	23.646246456907814
7391. this is dale nelson h the actor.	13.381820723199082
7392. i'm	calling you mr nelson at the request of mr phillip wycoff.	8.22227871994032
7393. could you possibly have lunch with him today?	7.730744897791682
7394.  his car could pick	you up at your hotel at twelve.	8.699012786417118
7395. you'll send	the rolls-royce of course?	4.028252201302384
7396.    yes of course mr	nelson.	14.895633550238912
7397. i started to say something else appropriate but	the man had hung up.	8.2645919900809
7398. i finally went downstairs to the bar off	the main lobby where most of the cast were drowning their sorrows over	the untimely passing of ask tony.	7.870827590954197
7399. they all bowed low as i approached	them.	10.174415927888445
7400. all right you bastards i said the great	actor is about to buy a drink.	8.804668379930106

7407. i followed him out through the	lobby to the street.	8.919503093065025
7408. an ancient rolls-royce as shiningly	impressive as the day it came off the ship was parked at the curb.	8.007244830016747
7409. the	elderly chauffeur immaculate in a dark uniform stood stiffly at attention	holding open the door of the town car.	6.530336735747246
7410. i was giving the parked cars the once-over.	13.53487361518177

7413. i walked with	him back to the entrance.	12.45532407214281
7414. he gave me a ticket on the agency car and	parked it.	12.065777119017971
7415. i was back in ten minutes.	13.169549833069913
7416. forgot to get something	out of the car i told him showing him my ticket.	8.544036776392577
7417. he	started to say something as i walked in and then suddenly grinned and	said oh yes.	5.632906832436872
7418. you're the one i was talking to about a monthly	rental.	7.747025361890182
7419. that's right i told him.	4.047684077162469
7420. he consulted	the parking ticket then looked at a notation and said you're	in the third row back toward the rear.	7.785829561258076
7421. can you find it all right?	11.698391586205423
7422. 	sure i told him.	11.568363037656766
7423. i went back to the agency	car and got out an electric bug one of the newest devices for electronic	shadowing.	7.695058640172767
7424. i always keep a set in the car.	12.405270606505063
7425. i put in new	batteries so as to be certain i'd have plenty of power and on my way	out walked over to the regular parking stalls and stood looking at	them thoughtfully.	7.6043516701635765
7426. i waited until the parking attendant was busy	with a customer then slipped around the back of the car with license	number jym 114 attached the electronic bug to the rear bumper	and walked out.	8.000353646655777
7427. the attendant waved me on.	10.915477388587384
7428. one of the	hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street trying	to make himself inconspicuous keeping an eye on the entrance of	an office building and waiting.	7.954136230059117
7429. for the first fifteen or twenty	minutes it's possible to be more or less interested in window displays	then in people passing by.	8.22541783033355
7430. after a while however a person's	mind gets fed up and that magnifies all of the disagreeable physical	symptoms which go with that sort of an assignment.	8.526565856142678
7431. you want to sit down.	17.074558415430587
7432. your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary.	9.42049305679531
7433. you're conscious	of the fact that your feet hurt that the city pavements are hard.	6.506826971906257
7434. i waited a solid two hours before my man came out of the office	building.	11.466575342549229
7435. i wasn't far behind him when	he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car.	6.103798641482219
7436. the attendant	recognized me once more and said what did you do about that	office?	8.346523409839932
7437.    i haven't made up my mind yet i said.	7.756099426258275
7438. i have a couple of them i'm figuring on;	one here and one that's out quite a ways where there's usually curb	parking.	9.869224950502858
7439. that curb parking is undependable and annoying	particularly when it rains he said.	7.09355477563453
7440. i kept trying to	get him to take my money.	11.648098955397426
7441. i'm in a rush	right now.	4.068096019485495
7442. i know where the car is.	16.952709348229043
7443. want me to drive it out?	7.622507342753323
7444. 	i'll have one of the boys get it he said.	10.714798989375401
7445. it's	one	of the rules on transients.	8.254441635698543
7446. regulars drive out their own cars.	9.670406878971576
7447. make it as snappy as you can will you?	9.076532239077546
7448.  i asked.	28.659110453221246
7449. oh that's all right he said.	8.869713567468498
7450. you're going to be a regular.	11.343912897355672
7451. you'll get in the office building here.	4.344740804498202
7452. you don't want to	lease a place way out in the sticks.	7.608747072131166
7453. you get business where the business	is not where it isn't.	8.498258318368384
7454. i grinned at him handed him	a couple of dollars and said by the time you get the parking charge	figured up there should be a cigar in it for you.	8.803620737814379
7455. i hurried	over to the agency heap jumped in started the motor and was just	in time to see the car i wanted to shadow turn to the left.	6.4341693966811775
7456. i was held up a bit trying to make a left turn.	14.187908309622946
7457. by the time i'd	made it he was gone.	11.992712599538887
7458. i turned on the	electric bug and the signal came in loud and clear.	9.136887661058207
7459. i made	time and picked him up within ten blocks.	8.555241096529764
7460. i stayed half a block behind	him letting lots of cars keep in between us listening to the steady	beep h beep h beep.	7.478183431629994
7461. after fifteen minutes of traffic driving	he turned to the left.	8.787833779344155
7462. i couldn't see him but the electric bugging	device gave steady beeps when it was straight ahead short half	beeps when the car i was following was to the left and long drawn-out	beeps when it turned to the right.	7.277776366913733
7463. if it ever got behind me the beep	turned to a buzz.	9.835727886985925
7464. i turned left too soon and got a signal showing	that i was still behind him but he was to the right.	9.34557911493335
7465. after a	while the signal became a buzz and i knew he was behind me.	6.874880119261764
7466. that meant	he'd parked someplace.	17.150845923962493
7467. i made a big circle until i located the	car parked at the curb in front of an apartment house.	6.911363260410427
7468. i found	a parking place half a block away sat in the car and waited.	9.84089673897897
7469. my quarry was in the apartment house for two hours.	8.813010333666961
7470. then he came out	and started driving toward the beach.	11.342635006252632
7471. by this time it was dark.	15.587909495293003
7472. i could get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop	far behind when there wasn't traffic.	8.72577307175207
7473. my lights would have been a	giveaway if i'd tried to shadow him in the conventional manner.	6.96142484154022
7474. moreover	i'd have lost him if it hadn't been for the electronic shadowing	device h.	8.092536019354142
7475. his signal was coming loud and clear and then all	of a sudden it turned to a buzz.	5.711261973568333
7476. i circled the block and found he was	in the parking lot of a high-class restaurant.	8.931703154506646
7477. i sat where	i could watch the exit and realized i was hungry.	7.319167417194751
7478. i sat there with	the faint odor of charcoal-broiled steaks tantalizing my nostrils and	occasionally catching the aroma of coffee.	7.721756160345477
7479. my man came out an	hour later drove to the beach turned right and after half a mile went	to the swim and tan motel.	5.947057886450539
7480. it was a fairly modern motel with	quite a bit of electrical display in front.	13.787580055762836
7481. i remembered it was the	peeping tom place.	9.95288923829895
7482. i waited until my man was coming out of	the office with the key to a cabin before i went in to register.	8.483055096104874
7483. the card the man i was shadowing had filled out was still on the	counter.	6.374057384651866
7484. i noticed that he was in unit 12 and that he had registered	under the name of oscar l palmer and wife giving a san francisco	address.	10.15477494569455
7485. he had written out the license number of his car	but had transposed the last two figures an old dodge which is still	good.	6.7856608612073055
7486. ninety-nine times out of a hundred the motel manager doesn't	check the license number on the plates against the license number the	tenant writes out.	7.719146987487635
7487. if he does it's still better than an even chance	he won't notice the transposition of the numbers and if he should	notice it the thing can be passed off as an honest mistake.	5.577482578465901
7488. i used the alias of robert c richards gave the first three letters	and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency	heap but a couple of phony numbers in between.	8.507753186683226
7489. i could have	written anything.	17.967007933334887
7490. the manager of the motel was a woman who apparently	didn't care.	12.528176446297998
7491. she was complying with the law in regard to registrations	but she certainly wasn't checking license numbers or bothering	the tenants.	7.063309822951709
7492. you mean you're all alone mr richards?	13.503944917508555
7493. 	that's right.	12.292407525564322
7494. your wife isn't going	to join you- later?	10.03091805064833
7495.    i don't think so.	5.50021416627485
7496. if	you expect her to show up she said you'd better put 'and	wife' on there.	8.943920171957652
7497. it's a formality you know.	1.9623085232945487
7498. any	difference in the rate?	11.568363037656766
7499.  i asked.	22.589978126100267
7500. not to you she said	smiling.	15.95632019170276
7501. it's ten dollars either way.	2.8478925195944758
7502. there are ice cubes in	a container at the far end and in another by the office.	12.726616388363585
7503. there are	three soft-drink vending machines and if you should be joined by- anybody-	try to keep things quiet if you will.	7.3850805787624125
7504. we like to run a nice	quiet place.	12.350455461918722
7505. thank you i told her.	18.097629685333064
7506. i took	another sidelong glance at the other registration card then took the	key to unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park	the car.	7.8834038284879835
7507. the construction was reasonably solid; not like	the cracker-box construction of so many of the motel units that have stucco	all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear	every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment.	6.505234799738623
7508. i	put a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side i wanted	to case.	9.135710116383748
7509. with the aid of that i could hear my man moving around heard	him cough a couple of times heard the toilet flush heard the sound	of water running.	6.914693663848247
7510. whoever his companion was going to be she	was going to join him later.	9.856999232122423
7511. she knew where to come.	11.145752833777212
7512. he didn't have	to telephone.	9.193006590653331
7513. i was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of	communication had been severed.	7.827119850626075
7514. it's one thing to go without food	when you're occupied with some work or when you're simply postponing	a meal but when you're dependent on someone else and know that you	can't eat until he's bedded down for the night hunger can	be a gnawing torture.	4.86420254272451
7515. i had noticed a drive-in down the road a	quarter of a mile.	8.312620027423952
7516. the batteries on the bugging device i had put on	the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong signals.	6.955804554600195
7517. the	powerful microphone i could press against the wall between my motel	unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation	and i was positively nauseated i was so hungry.	5.572462867908624
7518. i	got in the car drove down to the drive-in and ordered a couple of hamburgers	with everything included a cup of coffee and the fastest service	possible.	7.791911306996381
7519. the place wasn't particularly busy at that time	of night and the girl who was waiting on me who was clothed in the	tightest-fitting pair of slacks i had ever seen on a woman and a sweater	that showed everything there was- and there was lots of it- wanted	to be sociable.	5.282142843919387
7520. you really in a hurry handsome?	15.000064054538505
7521. 	she asked.	12.292407525564322
7522. i'm in a hurry beautiful.	5.161050289908855
7523. it's	early in the evening to be in a hurry.	8.908758180383437
7524. there's lots of time left.	5.932255538785735
7525. there may not be any women left i said.	16.667857476871472
7526. she gave	a little pout and said i don't get off work until eleven	o'clock.	9.156318964484921
7527. that's when my evening commences.	3.7701013369122567
7528. i'll	be here at ten-fifty-five i said.	9.670406878971576
7529. that's what they all say.	4.047684077162469
7530. what's that thing going	buzz-buzz-buzz in your car?	7.361768780586858
7531.    i said darn it that's	the automatic signal that shows when the ignition key is on.	6.5779768796623195
7532. i didn't	turn it off.	18.25917094604721
7533. i reached over and switched off the electronic bugging	device.	8.555241096529764
7534. she went in to get the hamburgers and i switched	on the device again and kept the signal from dowling's car coming	in steady and clear until i saw her starting back with the hamburgers.	6.956029615372498
7535. then i shut off the device again.	10.668675485546169
7536. she wanted to hang around	while i was eating.	10.749202706058774
7537. don't you think it's selfish to have	dinner before you go to pick her up?	3.5004366500261894
7538.    no i said.	19.667329348608774
7539. it's a kindness to her.	1.9623085232945487
7540. you see she's on a diet.	15.000064054538505
7541. she'll	eat just a pineapple and cottage cheese salad and i'm to have one	with her so she won't feel out of place.	4.958070100322966
7542. diets can be	terrible the girl said.	9.670406878971576
7543. how much overweight is she?	13.890718810382397
7544. 	not a bit i said but she's keeping her figure in hand.	7.391013650626644
7545. she looked at me provocatively.	12.301897508498586
7546. good figures should	be kept in hand she said and walked away with an exaggerated	wiggle.	7.541265265322622
7547. i turned on the device again half fearful that i might	find silence but the buzzes came in loud and clear.	5.940754220836242
7548. when i	switched on the lights for her to come and get the check i had the	exact change plus a dollar tip.	7.4971178211473015
7549. the fat man said all we gotta do is go around the corner.	8.5051185453557
7550. the thin man said that-a-way.	13.848082117783294
7551. second building on the right.	10.532374380133016
7552. it says police	right on the door.	17.84987887874553
7553. so even if we was as dumb as you	take us for we could still find it.	6.549868201809814
7554. roberta and dave began	to back toward the door.	9.227335526850027
7555. the thin man waved the gun again.	8.976097203071156
7556. he said	right around the corner.	15.385132030882776
7557. it says water works but	there is a policeman on duty too.	9.032098247626347
7558. a night policeman just	like in the states.	11.928226016714074
7559. you know?	25.54960716631462
7560.    canada doesn't have	much of this here juvenile delinquency problem but we keep a night	policeman all the same on account of the crazy tourists.	7.31063408654391
7561. at	the door dave paused to feel for the latch.	7.751431243877999
7562. roberta glanced up at	her husband.	10.472119682746735
7563. he was going to be sensible and not try to do anything	rash with that gun pointed at him.	9.117238664271278
7564. she measured the distance from where	they stood to the men and the gun measured the distance from the	men to the back room.	8.376713680091076
7565. she decided to risk it.	11.145752833777212
7566. there was something phony	about all this gun waving- something not quite what it seemed in	the detailed directions for finding the police.	8.91852427929917
7567. dave had the	latch under his thumb now and he removed his arm from his wife in order	to pull the door open.	5.352387431392803
7568. in a flash she was away to the back paying	no attention to three angry shouts from the male throats.	8.648784715927794
7569. she tore open	the back door.	11.145752833777212
7570. it was dark inside the room but enough light spilled	from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table	with a green cloth top.	7.677024252165791
7571. there was a small sideboard with some empty	beer bottles on it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs.	10.007959839945133
7572. slowly	she turned to face the men again.	9.788547083673919
7573. rat-face at the counter was on his	feet.	7.14162538120728
7574. the distance between where she stood and where dave waited at	the outside door was a hundred miles.	7.742799736705947
7575. keeping her frightened gaze on	the men at the counter she began to feel her way to the door.	5.832363686404538
7576. she	sidled along the booths one step at a time.	8.196044167676531
7577. as she reached dave and felt his arm go around her felt him pull	her to the safety of his person she knew with the certainty of despair	that something bad had happened to lauren.	5.391535258377538
7578. the two	men watched as dave closed the door behind them watched them cross the	sidewalk to their car.	7.48837548295765
7579. the fat man removed	his apron put on a greasy and wrinkled jacket and zipped it over his	paunch.	7.1921510978715055
7580. the thin man moved swiftly to the phone and dialed a	number.	9.005093323721033
7581. when he was answered he said albert?	15.342682489822055
7582.  vince.	19.804021762487697

7585.    he turned from the phone and strode to	the front of the restaurant.	9.062868461018464
7586. the white buick hadn't moved away yet.	13.837750211695223
7587. a line of worry formed a twitch pulled his mouth over to one	side.	6.40132428842376
7588. he said grosse?	35.485283191076476
7589.  you ain't kidding me- the	kid don't know the name of this town?	8.620562302768604

7595. 	kinda like a zombie?	9.118533821976325
7596.  she was just waking up when we found her at	the garage.	11.368476650587438
7597. stupid fools- ain't got	enough brains between the two of you-   grosse muttered his	head down one hand playing with the zipper on his jacket.	5.169927756473601
7598. had	enough brains to call ya up so as ya could do sompin about it when the	parents- i coulda let her go go- his eyes were lowered so	he couldn't have seen the narrow pointed face of his companion suddenly	writhe with fury; but he was aware of it just the same.	5.860895174228178
7599. he knew	vince steiner was one of those men who had to work up a fury once	in a while just to prove how dangerous he could be.	7.255326229239749
7600. with a curse	vince seized the thing nearest a glass sugar container with a spouted	metal top and threw it against the wall opposite.	8.065489469120287
7601. the heavy glass	didn't break but the top flew off; sugar sprayed with a hiss	that was loud in the silence.	5.925567108763268
7602. not really startled but careful	to appear so grosse sucked noisily on his pipe.	8.450098994704653
7603. why does everything have to happen to me?	8.655002088388734
7604.    grosse	quietly got a broom and started to sweep up the sugar.	7.615092762846159
7605. his mouth worked over the profanity the obscenities in his vocabulary.	6.583156031491742
7606. once he said why'n hell didn't you look in the back	seat of the car before you drove off?	8.291880579854636
7607.  don't you and barney ever	use your brains?	3.3662961860223732
7608.    the fat man didn't answer.	18.37337070214539
7609. he got one	of the menus and brushed the spilled sugar onto it and carried it to	a box on the floor behind the counter.	6.672775120968675
7610. he returned the menu to its	place between catchup bottle and paper napkin dispenser.	10.855545926247238
7611. she don't know nothing about them cars.	9.130734915764195
7612. she thinks	she's in a ordinary garage.	12.671390746668923
7613. how do you know stupid?	14.404179904518735
7614. 	and put cate's gun back.	10.472119682746735

7616. one word of this gets to	guardino-   who's telling guardino?	10.57319808690024
7617.    vince	swore again.	12.292407525564322
7618. you get that kid over to rose's house.	12.37182052821836
7619. he ran a finger down his cheek tracing the scratch	there.	7.953394054598466
7620. why can't i leave her locked up in the tool crib?	11.244813324238
7621. 	the thin man stopped his pacing long enough to glance at	the clock.	5.825820622377272
7622. you and barney get her over to rose's before it gets	too light.	9.72431981080246
7623. after guardino's left we'll dump the kid somewhere	near the border where she kin get home.	6.3290461798432265

7631. vince shouted finally get her over to rose's	and i'll come by and see that she stays put.	5.487964372169998
7632. grosse	rubbed the bridge of his nose where it was swollen.	9.184930205980875
7633. you don't hafta get nasty.	7.132401713521564
7634. i wish you luck when you try	scaring that kid.	12.16160284683209
7635. his voice lost its sullen	tones and he chuckled.	7.591810951946381
7636. what is it?	28.376061098518285
7637. 	impatiently.	15.610129252044759
7638. are you a poor dumb canadian or a smart	aleck from the states?	10.329852548231365
7639.    vince lifted his hand as if to	strike but his thin lips spread in a smile.	5.427950274147271
7640. where'd you say you was born?	9.670406878971576
7641.    in a chicago	slum just like you.	13.638847907015487
7642. and i ain't going back there on account of	one lousy kid.	10.852426491220497
7643. lauren landis rubbed her face against the blanket.	6.764147616291221
7644. she had cried a little because she was frightened.	11.720856044615866
7645. she could	easily understand why the two men had been startled to find a strange	girl in the back seat of their car but	she couldn't understand their subsequent actions.	6.3909798269363085
7646. was it because	she had shown panic?	15.088409477571643
7647.  who could blame her for that?	9.844444704784594
7648.  it was one thing	to awaken outside a restaurant where your parents were eating and	quite another to awaken in a strange garage and know your parents had	gone on home without you.	7.608903432558152
7649. she was glad the fat man had left.	11.481327732833313
7650. barney	was not really frightening.	11.568363037656766
7651. she jumped as the little man now appeared	at the window and reaching through the opening offered her a	bottle of coke.	5.739914467436109
7652. she smiled at him wetly.	14.140224473190667
7653. although she found she was	thirsty she was about to refuse	when she saw the bottle was unopened.	7.103592936670169
7654. he placed a bottle opener	on the counter.	12.411802052220429
7655. so he understood her panic.	13.56167514724094
7656. she blew her nose	on a tissue and opened the coke bottle.	9.118601195872367
7657. it was icy cold and tasted	delicious.	16.79056552587768
7658. she felt a lift in spirit.	12.671390746668923
7659. when she was finished she pushed	it back.	13.358747994489645
7660. the man was busy doing something to the inside of the door-frame	on the driver's side of a car.	11.133548122357238
7661. he looked in her direction but he didn't answer.	8.431773034471274
7662. she said barney why is he keeping me here?	11.932877954383603
7663. 	still no answer.	10.363724110347151
7664. he seemed to be looking at a point above the little	window.	16.099934764994575
7665. lauren said why can't i call my home?	6.764147616291221
7666.  or	borrow some money from someone and go home by bus?	7.879513779734377
7667.  i could send the	money right back.	13.11409871359913
7668. barney finished the cigarette he had been	smoking.	9.060328853487057
7669. he dropped it and carefully ground it to nothing with the	sole of his heavy shoe.	6.619567863599751
7670. now he looked at her.	18.573413083925605
7671. he said i only work	here.	0.0
7672. lauren said please?	13.148092146312546
7673.  but he was back at	work on a car.	14.01341913817578
7674. she dropped her head on her arms on the counter.	9.557448030765887
7675. how could he be kind one moment and cruel the next?	8.620932327512437
7676.  did he know	something that made him feel sad and sorry for her?	8.746043404013115
7677.  and was he afraid	to do anything as definite as releasing her?	7.309206614980695
7678.  her heart was thumping	painfully; the unknown was so much worse than- what dangers lay	ahead for her?	7.597917909731023
7679.  what awful thing had she to face in the next few	hours?	9.097980916693507
7680.  something wet and hot was trickling on her wrists.	9.133986058716442
7681. tears?	15.610129252044759
7682. 	with a sturdy act of will she turned her mind away from herself;	as long as she could do nothing constructive about the situation	she was in she would think about something else.	5.967983110975719
7683. her mother and father	for instance.	11.966979336405673
7684. where were they now?	15.215005521174389
7685.  in her mind she followed	the white buick along the road somewhere between here and the niagara	river.	7.56745021646989
7686. her father's attention would be on the road ahead and it	wouldn't deviate an inch until he crossed the bridge at the falls	and took the river road to lasalle and finally turned in at their	own driveway at 387 heather heights.	6.348195387404498
7687. then he would yawn and stretch	and shout all out.	8.940608156761064
7688. this is the end of the line.	34.61429421426756
7689. and	what would her mother be doing right now?	6.764147616291221
7690.  her mother would be fast	asleep curled up against that wonderful big safe solid shoulder next	to her on the front seat.	8.489825531374345
7691. lauren landis was in trouble and	she was alone.	6.764147616291221
7692. roberta landis put her hand on her husband's	arm as he slid in the driver's seat beside her.	6.691330314774275
7693. somewhere birds	were sweetly calling were answered.	10.073810850105469
7694. her teeth chattered so that she	made three attempts at speech before she became intelligible.	7.626080212453484
7695. i saw that woman's apron behind the door.	11.177305261288183
7696. there was a wet	spot- she couldn't have been gone long.	16.55821430968469
7697. dave made some	sound meant to convey agreement.	7.14162538120728
7698. he inserted the car key in the lock.	11.45143587764551
7699. she stammered you heard	what he said about police?	8.472846859613272
7700.  why don't we drive around the corner?	11.263243143073376
7701. 	the car door crashed shut.	8.254441635698543
7702. the engine throbbed into life.	13.848082117783294
7703. dave said i got the message.	7.622507342753323
7704. walk.	19.804021762487697
7705. suppose lauren comes	looking for us?	10.084025368194736
7706.  i can sit here in the car while you walk around	the corner.	13.712867771312988
7707. the big car sprang away from the curb like something	alive.	10.03019205879595
7708. he said i'm not going to leave my wife and my car	out here in sight of those-   roberta glanced at him and stopped	trembling.	8.837088224027429
7709. his jowls were spiked by barbs of graying beard.	7.18676379039501
7710. his small mean eyes	regarded marty steadily unblinkingly.	10.276228481933904
7711. his eyes were threaded by little	filaments of red as if tiny veins had burst and flooded blood into	them.	5.828220427883686
7712. as he chewed his gum and exuded wheezing breath marty smelt	the reek of bad whiskey.	9.214562690802444
7713. he had driven	the car that passed them on the road outside admassy's place.	10.794939530875643
7714. this was acey squire proprietor of the juke joint.	14.32158902432901
7715. marty	smiled at squire pleasantly and said there was a cab waiting for	me here.	6.259237271130338
7716. do you know where it might have gone?	16.611474385990263
7717.    squire chewed	his gum his jaw moving in a steady rhythm.	6.210871206873012
7718. he looked straight	at marty.	17.83289566254582
7719. marty scanned the faces of the others	nearest him looked into their staring eyes.	6.6946152953147955
7720. did anyone see	my cab?	14.439799658548122
7721.  he asked keeping his voice casual.	13.048275453688044
7722. he avoided	showing any surprise or annoyance when no one answered him.	9.592132658614503
7723. i	have to get back to jarrodsville he went on.	8.03159450170373
7724. i see there are	some cars here.	13.93195501835056
7725. i wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back	to town?	7.878459325704475
7726.  i'd be happy to pay for the favor of course.	7.908952444614561
7727. the seventeen men stood and stared at him for a moment longer.	8.117228151739228
7728. and	then a startling thing occurred.	10.70968330824016
7729. it was so utterly unexpected that	marty stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open foolishly	after it had happened.	7.16567459221874
7730. there was no word spoken no apparent	signal given.	20.802109705023614
7731. yet the men all moved at the same instant.	10.8388841121336
7732. they piled into the waiting cars motors roared the cars sped off.	8.949441394945763
7733. the station wagon and the old plymouth headed east toward jarrodsville.	7.098087065137257
7734. the ford and the pickup truck sped west toward sanford's	run.	9.430036403335416
7735. in seconds all four cars were out of sight.	8.694445957554716
7736. marty land stood alone on a red-clay road as storm clouds gathered ominously	in the sky again.	6.757567981697296
7737. from a great distance thunder growled and	broke the silence.	9.455075993854752
7738. land looked back toward the dilapidated house.	10.197278420317867
7739. he thought he saw a pale face at a window.	9.059809595155953
7740. perhaps it was dora	may.	18.049658483591365
7741. perhaps she would be glad that they hadn't hurt him.	7.914210124878492
7742. there	were other farmhouses nearby.	11.78959997873465
7743. across the road there was one no	more than a hundred yards away.	8.808412869337506
7744. there was another on this side a little	further down.	16.68996007555136
7745. there were many more between here and jarrodsville.	15.266049895326782
7746. telephone poles lined the road.	10.472119682746735
7747. they reared tall and mocking.	11.59862953739988
7748. their	wires stretched out into infinity.	10.472119682746735
7749. not a single strand of wire reached	into the silent houses beside the red-clay road.	7.541547680663954
7750. there was	nothing he could do but walk.	16.836741523975633
7751. and jarrodsville was more than three	miles away down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a quagmire.	6.244497377847807
7752. marty faced east and started walking down the left side	of the road.	7.391013650626644
7753. after he had proceeded a few feet he paused and turned	up the cuffs of his trousers which were already damp and mud-caked.	6.339121925316507
7754. the viscous mud was ankle-deep and in places great puddles spread across	the road and reflected the murky light.	7.333060553020843
7755. as he approached	the first farmhouse thunder sounded behind him again closer now and	louder like a steadily advancing drum corps.	6.4659770457617185
7756. there were several people	on the porch of the farmhouse.	16.75224216381889
7757. there was a very old man and a young	woman and a brood of children ranging from toddlers to teen-agers.	8.847806055903199
7758. for just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help.	10.232073241907358
7759. perhaps	they had a car or truck and would drive him into town.	5.825820622377272
7760. then he realized	the utter futility of the idea.	12.201937008257943
7761. they were staring at him in the same	blank and menacing way that the men outside the gate had stared.	7.360781542364718
7762. even	the eyes of the smallest children seemed malicious.	11.026484682087258
7763. on his	side of the road there were two farm hands well back in a field leaning	against a plow.	8.47767191806586
7764. they too stared at him.	20.180011942752163
7765. the drums of	thunder were right behind him now.	8.341215694113531
7766. a foolish thought came into	his head.	11.87006678428286
7767. he remembered a story he had read as a youth.	7.953394054598466
7768. it was probably	one of kipling's tales of the british army.	15.643385070013233
7769. it concerned an officer	who had been disgraced and drummed out.	9.093323993376403
7770. the steady roll of the drums	had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of	the men he had commanded and each man about-faced and turned his back	as the officer approached.	6.179445157832027
7771. marty wished these poor farm people would	turn their backs.	6.460370037324521
7772. the fencing by the roadside ended.	12.435529358277208
7773. now the	dirt highway was bordered on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch	too broad to leap over unless you were an olympic star.	5.308349580801306
7774. the day's	rain had been added to the stagnant water.	11.54662486956667
7775. he was trapped on the	road when he heard the sound of an approaching car.	8.852912502785658
7776. it was coming toward	him.	31.04425555256091
7777. the car was now in sight.	11.476587269112558
7778. marty's heart skipped a beat when	he recognized it.	8.581436094141479
7779. it was the station wagon that had passed his cab	on the road the station wagon that had been parked at the burch farm.	7.378744394077628
7780. it had headed back toward jarrodsville.	20.149343399215635
7781. that had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road.	7.736906500522577
7782. now acey and his friends were returning to seek him out.	8.859365232996492
7783. the station wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of	him beside a fenced field.	7.331614829644501
7784. then there was another sound.	29.45937393771581
7785. a second	car was coming from the west from the direction of sanford's run.	10.29382618108245
7786. it was the ford that had been outside burch's farm.	17.672359374005843
7787. marty	looked helplessly in both directions.	8.254441635698543
7788. it was a narrow road barely	wide enough for two cars to pass.	13.488908319014568
7789. he could not leave the road because	of the water-filled drainage ditch.	9.650673761922635
7790. when the two cars were equidistant	from him the station wagon started up again and the ford gathered	speed.	8.546279744725828
7791. they bore down on him.	11.59862953739988
7792. there was nothing he could do except	jump into the ditch.	16.825142300007506
7793. he jumped and sank to his knees in muddy	water.	8.431773034471274
7794. as the two cars roared by there was a high-pitched eerie	nerve-shattering sound.	12.117410303352786
7795. marty knew how the union soldiers must	have felt at chancellorsville and antietam and gettysburg when the	ragged gray ranks charged at them screaming the wild banshee howl they	called the rebel yell.	4.595688357851942
7796. for moments he stood in water shivering	and gasping for breath.	9.816367117220269
7797. he had turned his ankle slightly and it	pained him.	10.632478061270312
7798. the cars with their load of howling men had disappeared	in the distance.	8.649006242526841
7799. there had been two more cars parked at the farm	a plymouth and a pickup truck.	8.501474142658573
7800. they would be coming for him next bearing	down on him from both directions.	10.823627102748247
7801. and then the station wagon and	the ford would seek him out again.	8.554799522271034
7802. he would be harassed repeatedly	and would escape death by inches time after time all the way to jarrodsville.	12.58774980505965
7803. he still had three miles to go.	10.354498460886402
7804. back east the more affluent	juvenile delinquents who could afford hyped-up autos instead of	switch blades as lethal weapons played this same game and called it	chicken.	6.983158877846837
7805. he could not go through the fields.	14.785828685687926
7806. that way	was barred on both sides of the road by a high barbed-wire fence.	13.864001858301561
7807. he	had to make for the section of road just ahead that was bordered by the	rail fence the section by the farmhouse.	5.002746102583385
7808. at least he could climb	up on the fence when his tormenters roared by again.	9.507566650611015
7809. the admassy place	could not be far now.	8.976097203071156
7810. he would go in there climb through the window	and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest.	7.897251860456951
7811. there	was even a bare chance that the phone had not been disconnected.	7.103022016288733
7812. he did not dare climb back up to the road.	16.15662300097199
7813. he was deep in water but	at least they could not reach him there.	7.966892886463579
7814. he splashed on mud sucking	at his feet with each step until he reached the end of the drainage	ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm.	10.533068408994971
7815. he climbed	back to the road and he felt utterly exhausted.	9.042933698155595
7816. he stood panting	for a moment.	15.385132030882776
7817. and then he saw something that he had not seen before	and panic gripped him again.	8.805857841963457
7818. the fence his only refuge when	the metal death came roaring at him was made of rails all right	but the rails were protected by a thick screening of barbed wire that	would rip his flesh if he pressed against it.	6.084676418953135
7819. he lurched on down the	road despairingly because there was no place else to go.	7.295251397436043
7820. he lost	all sense of dignity.	15.385132030882776
7821. you could not stand on dignity when you were	soaked and muddied and your life was at stake.	6.992275234279722
7822. probably people were	watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of this farmhouse	too but he did not bother to look.	8.398303515901068
7823. he broke into a dogtrot breathing	heavily streaming with sweat.	10.034519565399064
7824. he had to reach admassy's place.	21.663703668045475
7825. it was his only sanctuary.	21.229545245511318
7826. the fences on both sides of the road	bristled with the barbed wire.	12.66515430157824
7827. the fences stretched on endlessly.	10.915477388587384
7828. and then he heard them.	18.86503273716779
7829. and now he saw them.	15.497367415088053
7830. the	plymouth was coming at him from the east the pickup truck from the west.	9.038062895037312
7831. they had timed it better this time.	11.40431524167798
7832. they would reach him at almost	exactly the same instant.	12.157767344359623
7833. if he backed	against the fence one of the cars would brush him as it passed and he	would be cruelly lacerated by the wire.	7.012257993318764
7834. he stumbled to the middle	of the road and simply stood there waiting for them a perfect	target.	10.111018348845306
7835. the cars must have had their gas pedals pushed down to	the floor boards.	6.95200839516111
7836. they were coming on at reckless speed for such old	vehicles.	10.84020369580526
7837. he held his arms close to his sides	and made himself as small as possible.	7.3385569144041565
7838. when the plymouth neared it	veered toward him and seemed about to run him down.	9.980257170128233
7839. he forced himself	to stay frozen there.	10.776005861178222
7840. if he moved he would be in the path of the	other car.	16.259434193434924
7841. he thought the fender of the plymouth brushed his jacket	as it went by.	7.312796818751656
7842. in a fraction of a second the pickup truck hurtled by	on the other side.	11.207896904133227
7843. the weird insane sound of the rebel yell	reverberated again and echoed from the distant hills.	6.531762313405271
7844. he did not	leave the middle of the road.	23.375271369795726
7845. he did not try to run.	18.926258670204874
7846. he trudged on	his aching eyes focused straight ahead.	11.45143587764551
7847. he was nearing the admassy	house.	15.66991192537313
7848. he was going to make it he told himself.	22.211208775376477
7849. and then he heard	a car coming from the east and he felt as if he would break down and	weep.	9.89391149854661
7850. oh no not again he said aloud.	11.795206421441982
7851. there was a new sound a sound as piercing as the rebel	yell yet different.	9.876037648158727
7852. it was the sound of a siren.	26.247878866886907
7853. now he saw that	the approaching car was painted white and he began to wave his arms	frantically.	7.600761725188938
7854. it was the prowl car from the sheriff's office.	17.54121672084635
7855. the car drew up alongside him and stopped.	8.89168756780034
7856. get in	charley estes said brusquely.	12.429680042016331
7857. he staggered into the back seat	and lay back fighting for breath.	7.560809233574742
7858. there was someone in front with	the sheriff.	20.03389606306391
7859. it was pete holmes the cabdriver.	16.79056552587768
7860. pete turned	around and said to marty i guess you think i'm a yellow-bellied	hound.	8.065699339007521
7861. but there wasn't no use in me staying there.	12.438075270643553
7862. i couldn't	fight a dozen or so of 'em.	11.633205579815934
7863. if i'd stayed all that i'd have	got was four punctured tires and one busted head.	6.730727354097876
7864. why didn't you	wait at the burch house?	11.263243143073376
7865.  you must've known i'd gone to get	the sheriff.	9.751843329843403
7866. i was lucky they let me go i guess.	12.48176176282084
7867. the sheriff	was occupied with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space.	7.2080191696869
7868. when it was finally pointed east he said you should never have	come out here alone.	11.421769046798975
7869. every man in every	one of these houses is a night rider.	6.952845418951914
7870. then he turned the telephone over to rourke and went into the	bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes.	7.705649764835993
7871. rourke was	talking on the phone when he came back.	7.457360717361135
7872. about an hour eh?	19.777997230993044
7873.  are	you positive?	14.194049587746285
7874.  he listened a moment and then said hold it.	10.697093789223626
7875. he turned his head and said alvarez will definitely be in a back	room at the jai alai club on south beach within an hour.	6.075759730324047
7876. want	to try and meet him there?	9.670406878971576
7877.    shayne looked at his watch.	8.254441635698543
7878. that	wasn't too far from fifth street and should allow him to make	scotty's bar by midnight.	7.805510138836241
7879. he said with satisfaction that's	fine tim.	15.273118693749337
7880. rourke confirmed the appointment	over the phone and hung up.	8.196044167676531
7881. i don't know what you're getting	into mike he said unhappily.	4.429755268831268
7882. i hope to christ h.	17.313842160825082
7883. shayne said briskly grab another drink if you want it.	7.390364814491532
7884. we've	got one other call to make before i meet alvarez.	7.333229404072402
7885. where?	15.610129252044759
7886.    it's out in the northeast section.	5.298566229757954
7887. have	you got my car here?	8.254441635698543
7888.    it's parked in front.	3.494115764450294
7889. rourke	hastily slopped whiskey into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes.	7.409373726080841
7890. i'd better keep on driving yours shayne decided	because i'll be going on over to the beach.	6.143906189869945
7891. i can drop you back	here to pick mine up.	10.33239223804919
7892. he went to a closet to get a light jacket	and took his hat from beside the door.	10.81231970759683
7893. timothy rourke gulped down	the whiskey hastily and joined him asking who are we going to call	on in the northeast section?	6.587675203147098
7894.    a lady.	21.944778634142413
7895. that is maybe	not too much of a lady.	11.691503408302182
7896. at least i want to find out whether she's	home yet or not.	19.84097714748659
7897. he opened the door and followed rourke out.	9.026368296067464
7898. in rourke's car shayne drove east to biscayne boulevard	and north toward felice perrin's address which had been given to	him by the peralta governess.	7.906393523031058
7899. as he drove he filled in timothy rourke	briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter	to go to the peralta house and on his own surmises.	7.563358274211087
7900. i want	to be in scotty's bar at midnight when marsha makes her phone call	there he ended grimly.	7.9047212310212736
7901. i don't know whether that threatening	letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not but	i want to see who takes the call.	4.7163471910332175
7902. this deal at las	putas buenas where the two knife-men jumped you said rourke with	interest that sounds like it was set up with malice aforethought	by the luscious mrs peralta doesn't it?	6.89143729794099
7903.    it	does shayne grunted sourly still able to taste her mouth on his	in	the green jungle parking lot.	5.326519577128725
7904. that story of hers about an unsigned	note directing her to be there tonight sounds completely phony.	9.011319350587623
7905. if	it was designed to put me on the spot it would have to have been written	before peralta ever called me in on the case.	8.545146589366642
7906. do	you think laura did have the counterfeit bracelet made without her husband's	knowledge?	7.80063608173729
7907.    i haven't the faintest idea.	10.74870959618676
7908. i	think her husband strongly suspects so and that's why he called me	in on the thing in direct defiance of his confederates h and almost	certainly without telling them why he was doing so.	5.762497154626007
7909. isn't this felice's	street?	5.466376808403582
7910.  shayne asked peering ahead at the partially	obscured street sign.	8.196044167676531
7911. rourke could see it better out the right-hand	side and he said yes.	6.97780378053093
7912. turn to the left i think for that	number you gave me.	12.894470970654583
7913. not more than a block or so.	16.67842473939934
7914. shayne	got in the left-hand lane and cut across the boulevard divider.	7.615092762846159
7915. there	was a small neon-lighted restaurant and cocktail lounge on the southeast	corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet palm-lined	street where most of the houses on both sides were older two-story	mansions now cut up into furnished rooms and housekeeping apartments.	5.098788135853823
7916. shayne drove westward from the boulevard slowly letting rourke	crane his head out the window and watch for street numbers.	6.44893033609597
7917. a single	automobile was parked half-way up the block on the left-hand side.	6.62197242591231
7918. shayne noted idly that it carried miami beach license plates as he	approached and then saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they	passed indicating that it was occupied.	6.720024081800909
7919. he turned to see	the briefly-illumed faces of two men in the parked car just as rourke	said it's the next house mike.	6.8525247802191185
7920. instead	of pulling into the curb shayne increased his speed slightly to	the corner where he swung left.	7.310123344753422
7921. he went around the corner and parked	turning off his lights and motor.	8.246688113127892
7922. i told you mike said	rourke in an aggrieved voice.	13.65024438448851
7923. it was back there h.	19.850098703869534
7924. shayne said i know it was tim.	9.060328853487057
7925. his voice was chilling and	cold.	9.627882438407596
7926. did you see the car parked across the street?	11.16727610683369
7927. 	i didn't notice it.	9.118533821976325
7928. i was watching for numbers h.	16.70774452185394
7929. it	has a beach license tim.	9.085188587107783
7930. two men in the front seat.	17.526257889844835
7931. i got a	quick look at their faces as we went past.	7.656668534210395
7932. unless i'm crazy as hell	they're two of painter's dicks.	9.327683862769675
7933. a couple named harris and geely.	15.315955641105198
7934. those names mean anything to you?	12.212278412638026
7935.    wait a minute	mike.	10.363724110347151
7936. in painter's office this evening h.	14.227369829482376
7937. the pair whom petey is officially commending for	slapping me around and pulling me in.	6.374057384651866
7938. what are they doing	here?	27.170418025661107
7939.    a stake-out i suppose.	11.781091587713144
7940. maybe with specific orders to see that i don't make contact with her.	9.038166013140362
7941. i may be wrong.	15.992409269611992
7942. i'll slide out and	walk around the block back to the cocktail lounge on biscayne.	6.477175972722581
7943. you drive	on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there.	7.665003147107107
7944. you're	a reporter and you're looking for miss perrin to interview her.	7.615092762846159
7945. make them show their hands.	10.581106838499764
7946. if they are beach cops on a stake-out	they'll admit it to a reporter.	13.090699354511704
7947. they've got no official standing	on this side of the bay.	6.386246814644919
7948. as soon as you find out if they are geely	and harris come on around to the lounge where i'll be waiting.	9.734379885227412
7949. shayne opened the door on his side and stepped out.	6.4640617368073805
7950. timothy	rourke groaned dismally as he slid under the wheel.	8.292150162768825
7951. the things you	talk me into mike h.	8.976097203071156
7952. how often	do they add up to headlines?	15.919192990077434
7953.  you should complain.	25.408451173209862
7954. he crossed	the street and walked swiftly southward to circle back to the boulevard	and north a block to the open restaurant.	9.158462629516395
7955. he was standing	at the end of the bar enjoying a slug of cognac when rourke came	in six or eight minutes later.	0.0
7956. the reporter nodded as he moved up beside	him at the bar.	9.148448712144212
7957. shayne told the bartender bourbon and water	and rourke told him it's those two all right.	5.427950274147271

7962. be excited and don't	identify yourself.	16.469374782788545
7963. just say that a couple of drunks are having a hell	of a fight down the street and they better send a patrol car.	6.283879454597209
7964. then	hang up fast and come walking on down to the perrin address.	8.9527035316253
7965. i'll	be waiting for you there.	8.254441635698543
7966. the bartender brought rourke's	drink and shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar.	8.346523409839932

7968. will that	pay for a pint i can take with me.	9.315651355315381

7970. candy is dandy but liquor is quicker h	and you don't have any candy for sale here anyhow.	6.329202385379057
7971. the bartender winked back at him and palmed the bill.	7.43304005989246
7972. he turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of brandy in	a small paper sack which he slid over the counter to shayne.	8.600398494181137
7973. as the detective slid it into his pocket rourke asked sadly what	in hell are you going to do mike?	7.7040858636855996
7974.    make a couple of	punk detectives named geely and harris wish to god they'd stayed	out of my way this afternoon.	7.35694663927117
7975. shayne	strode out blithely and rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink	getting a dime ready to make the telephone call to the police.	5.417398947090422
7976. outside shayne hesitated when he saw that rourke had parked his	coupe directly in front of the bar headed south.	0.0
7977. he walked over to	the right-hand door opened it and got the reloaded automatic out of	the glove compartment and put it in his hip pocket.	6.4858849178578275
7978. he hoped he wouldn't	be forced to use it in taking care of the beach detectives but	its weight was comforting at his hip.	9.717381495550796
7979. on this side of the bay miami	beach cops had no more legal rights than any ordinary citizen and	shayne's pistol permit was just as good as theirs.	8.005935493427057
7980. he went	swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two beach detectives	in the front seat.	8.73838136623721
7981. he tugged the brim of his hat low as he approached	stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around	to the right-hand side.	5.719408449555592
7982. the big paunchy man named geely	was on that side half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced	companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door.	6.876982948136344
7983. shayne turned the handle and jerked the door open before either	of the men were quite aware of his presence in the night.	5.2846919546143925
7984. geely	grunted and slid partly out and shayne's left arm snaked in around	his neck to help him while he set himself solidly on the roadway	and swung his right fist to the big gum-chewing jaw before geely could	straighten up.	5.895558542326738
7985. shayne stepped back to let him slump to the	ground and then dived over him through the open door into harris who	was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster	somewhat impeded by the steering wheel.	4.514874383489016
7986. shayne locked his big	hands around harris' thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into	the roadway.	6.936781571907439
7987. he hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt	the body go limp.	7.306258114196296
7988. he dropped him into the street a couple of feet	away from geely's recumbent figure and stared down at both of them	for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side.	7.135459684880451
7989. they were both breathing heavily out cold and shayne didn't	think either of them had recognized him or could describe him.	6.947864265661012
7990. he got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and unscrewed the	top sprinkled the pungent stuff liberally over both men and then tossed	the open bottle in on the front seat.	7.8032607414797
7991. he turned then to	look toward the lighted boulevard and saw rourke's tall emaciated	figure come out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the	street toward the opposite side.	6.1998005309335635
7992. shayne strolled across to intercept	the reporter in front of the two-story house where felice perrin	lived and asked casually get the police okay?	7.55559647569861
7993. 	sure.	15.610129252044759
7994. said they'd have a patrol car here fast.	10.210106837365736
7995. what happened with you?	15.219243912387624
7996.    why the two damned fools	got all excited when they saw the bottle and knocked each other out	cold shayne said good-humoredly.	7.29567053322637
7997. they'll have fun explaining	that to the miami cops.	5.079531426293897
7998. got no business over here on a stake-out anyway.	8.196044167676531
7999. they went up onto a front porch and into a small hallway	where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling.	6.741367834934457
8000. a row of mailboxes	along the wall had numbers and names on them.	8.877303172720152
8001. shayne found one marked	perrin 2-a.	8.254441635698543
8002. the stairway on the right was dark but	there was a wall-switch at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb	at the top and they went up.	8.154044149726303
8003. there were two front rooms both	dark behind their transoms and there was no sound or light in the entire	house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake.	8.017104683650182
8004. eight nine steps above him roberts had paused.	9.436678141993546
8005. mickey paused	with him waiting no longer impatient trying now to think it out	do a little planning.	5.629511969000946
8006. he looked down over the banister at the hotel desk	with the telephone and pen set.	8.854785543103228
8007. if i could call in they	could check the story while we were on our way.	8.684450627726823
8008. i wouldn't have to	tell them i had roberts-   then he heard it like a muffled	thud felt a subtle change in air pressure.	7.159086737136804
8009. he glanced up in time to	see roberts hurtling down on him from above literally flying through	the air his bloody face twisted.	5.6945138009050655
8010. mickey tried to flatten against the	banister gripped it with one hand but roberts' full weight struck	him at that moment in the groin.	6.40734308751012
8011. he gasped for air and the impact	tore	his hand from the rail.	8.034634977535386
8012. he tumbled with roberts helpless and in	agony over and over down the steps.	10.180693021092926
8013. by a wrenching effort	he managed to hunch and draw in to take the final fall on his back and	shoulders rather than his head.	5.825722134044434
8014. he was fuzzy in his mind and for a	moment helpless on the lobby floor but he was conscious and free of	the weight of roberts' body.	8.588114322878491
8015. when his vision cleared he saw the taller	one scrambling upward reaching.	8.857318426905678
8016. mickey was on his knees when roberts	turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand.	7.852265714596708
8017. he felt	his empty pocket and knew that roberts had retrieved the only weapon	at hand.	6.718491433348979
8018. mickey's eyes fixed on the other's feet which	would first betray the moment and direction of an attack.	6.989868794419231
8019. he rose stiffly	forcing his knees to lock.	9.783357976961607
8020. the knifelike pain in his groin nearly	brought him down again.	9.430036403335416
8021. he made himself back off slowly his eyes	wary on roberts who now had no more to lose than he.	7.348928374642074
8022. the pain dulled	as he moved and he steadied inside.	10.681903590246268
8023. after a moment he extended one	hand the fingers curled.	9.165583443848885
8024. you want	to be that big a fool- i was hoping for this.	9.72431981080246
8025. roberts	brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps.	5.674295354649883
8026. he	held the razor well out to one side.	8.581436094141479
8027. he was invulnerable to attack	but he could be handled mickey knew if he could be brought to make	the first move.	7.679991348947992
8028. they were eight feet apart when roberts cleared	the last step.	11.251453063458266
8029. mickey waited with slack arms.	8.254441635698543
8030. any time	roberts he said.	13.437452972638015
8031. or would it be easier if i put my hands in	my pockets?	6.84707750872383
8032.    the taunt was lost on roberts.	12.435529358277208
8033. he advanced	slowly directly giving no hint of a feint to either side.	7.233226891479716
8034. he was	just short of arm's reach when he stopped.	10.697093789223626
8035. mickey backed off two steps	forcing him to come on again.	6.210871206873012
8036. there was a fixed grin on roberts'	face made hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood.	10.899026270576368
8037. mickey backed off again and roberts hesitated then came along.	6.210871206873012
8038. they moved in a series of rhythmic fits and starts a macabre dance-	two steps back two steps forward two steps back.	8.743454203861763
8039. mickey felt his shoulders	come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door.	5.9866825484836985
8040. this	was going to be it now any second and what he had to remember was	to keep his eye on the razor no matter what even if roberts should	feint with a kick to the groin the deadly hand was his exclusive concern.	7.433312258033625
8041. the kick came sudden and vicious but short.	8.341215694113531
8042. mickey's	guts twisted with the effort but he kept his eye on the weapon.	10.434558576077631
8043. it	moved in a silver arc toward his throat then veered downward.	6.002446559592496
8044. he hunched	his left shoulder into it and slashed at roberts' forearm with	his own felt the blade slide off his sleeve.	7.6036071554604625
8045. before roberts could	move inside to cut upward toward his face he slammed his right fist into	roberts' belly.	5.885168241210194
8046. roberts sagged and slashed at him wildly.	9.060328853487057
8047. ducking	mickey tripped and fell to one side landing heavily on the wood	floor.	7.315711999693695
8048. then roberts was on him gasping for breath and for a couple	of seconds mickey lost sight of the blade.	8.413376229085014
8049. he felt it rip at the side	of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs.	6.866512429945203
8050. he got a	knee up into roberts' belly used both hands and heaved him clear	then scrambled to his feet.	8.166094118245804
8051. they were in the center of the lobby now.	23.768636420303928
8052. still clutching the razor roberts came up into a crouch shaking	his head.	8.376208508903884
8053. when he charged mickey was ready.	14.116373955834497
8054. he hit roberts with his	left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly then wobbled	in mid-air.	7.759051364970662
8055. with his right fist and nearly all his weight behind	it he smashed at the bloodstained face.	6.544331064817348
8056. roberts careened backward	his back arched fought for balance and failing stumbled against	the newel post at the foot of the stairs.	7.456506896844408
8057. the sound of his head striking	the solid wood was an ultimate sudden-end sound.	8.527451108963062
8058. he fell on	his side across the lowest step rolled over once then lay still.	8.52351370118872
8059. mickey found himself leaning against the desk with stiff hands	panting for breath.	5.825820622377272
8060. after a minute he went to roberts looked at one	of his eyes and felt for a pulse.	9.55325565441434
8061. roberts appeared	to be dead; if not yet then soon very soon.	6.002446559592496
8062. suddenly it was	cold in the lobby.	11.949868724186603
8063. it seemed to him that a long time	had passed before he decided what to do.	8.035161904697041
8064. actually it was no more than	eight or ten minutes and the sum of his reasoning came to this:	there's no way to take him in now and keep those other two-	wister and the one who hired the two of them- from finding out about	roberts and lamming out.	6.8343320214884615
8065. the local law here would hold me till they	check clear back home and maybe more than that.	6.237118441149396
8066. by then they could never catch up with the others.	12.101639358892868
8067. there's no other	way; i'll have to do it myself.	0.0
8068. he looked at where roberts	lay sprawled on the step.	10.697093789223626
8069. mickey was sure now he was dead.	7.14162538120728
8070. one thing he thought nobody knows about it yet.	14.447783395969237
8071. he climbed the stairs went into roberts' room found a suitcase	and	packed as much into it as he could.	6.034462242787552
8072. he left a few things.	15.385132030882776
8073. it didn't	have to be perfect.	14.93623902024112
8074. walking away on impulse	he might logically leave behind what it was inconvenient to carry.	7.540116520279857
8075. when he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about	the room wiping carefully everything he might have touched.	7.5300078148850345
8076. it took	him nearly an hour.	18.949080935241245
8077. he went to the room he had rented and got into	his overcoat.	11.709515821489353

8079. he set roberts' suitcase near the front door went outside and	walked back to the garage.	8.886107430136914
8080. he was mildly surprised to find it was snowing.	14.211516360447677
8081. it snowed softly silently an undulating interruption of his vision	against the night sky.	7.7671880347284485
8082. he could feel it on his face and in his	hair.	12.06465860520203
8083. he found the key to the jeep got it started and warmed	it up for five minutes.	8.297643599424909
8084. then he backed out and swung around to the front	drive.	10.65442028724022
8085. he went into the hotel and searched till he found the razor.	9.816173281235287
8086. he put it in his own pocket for safekeeping.	14.106975157504383
8087. he took the suitcase	out to the jeep and put it in the front seat.	9.315306603466643
8088. then he went back for	roberts.	16.74401759339534
8089. the body was heavier than he had anticipated.	10.771810830029382
8090. he	got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down	to the jeep.	6.757567981697296
8091. he dumped it into the back and made sure it wouldn't	roll out then returned to the porch and closed the front door making	sure it was unlocked.	6.325294000075946
8092. he drove carefully in the direction	of the brief tour they had taken earlier.	8.903842685622099
8093. it snowed continuously but	quietly evenly.	14.93623902024112
8094. when he reached the dip in the woods he saw that	already the earlier ruts were barely discernible.	9.971495494628584
8095. the jeep fought its	way through the low spot and got onto higher ground.	6.578982329721101
8096. he drove in low	gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance	to the abandoned mine.	8.014374216772145
8097. he parked facing it and left the headlights	on but when he started into the tunnel with the suitcase he found	the illumination extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the	passage.	5.526991894749357
8098. he went back and got the flashlight returned to the tunnel	and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier.	11.049624383215852
8099. he tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around	it.	6.718491433348979
8100. when the dust settled he went back to the jeep and carefully	worked roberts' body onto his shoulder.	10.069313039287339
8101. it wasn't like carrying	the suitcase.	14.93623902024112
8102. the soft snow was deceitful underfoot.	12.435529358277208
8103. inside the passage he had to work his way over the fallen	timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden.	6.432671279497968
8104. by the time	he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back	ached under the drag of the dead weight.	8.387761450623994
8105. he stood looking down	for a few seconds then backed up two or three paces from the edge.	6.646781979824382
8106. there was too much weight casually to toss it away.	15.67536552333615
8107. he could feel	himself falling in with it and being unable to get out.	7.7507717870617805
8108. it would be	a bad place to die.	20.417288907027125
8109. it was a bad place for roberts to wind up but	roberts had asked for it.	9.9847153510563
8110. it was too late to worry about that.	24.412977420136443
8111. he knelt slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel.	9.363519704229052
8112. it was a relief to get rid of the weight.	19.47779136551613
8113. he was shaking with tension	and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down.	7.504066937200206
8114. then he got on his knees and rolled roberts' body toward the edge.	10.533959728174437
8115. it hung momentarily on the point of dropping off.	11.295983996269719
8116. he gave it a	strong push heard it slide then tumble dryly into the hole.	9.468559208180503
8117. he got	to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit.	8.01906370078502
8118. the body lay	in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel	floor.	11.475543461998338
8119. there was little chance	anyone would enter this shaft during the winter.	11.122798164010788
8120. the external signs of	his approach to it would be covered by the snow probably by the next	day.	8.552336480129995
8121. it wasn't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact.	9.061377067558361
8122. by spring it would be a skeleton.	14.983055105167265
8123. he made his way back to	the jeep.	14.932189904161334

8133. liz peabody he thought might spend	some time grieving for her lost lover but he doubted that she would	launch an investigation.	5.0176589645046334
8134. he judged her to be a woman of some pride	though not much sense.	9.737998690592923
8135. still she would probably have sense enough not	to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who apparently	had run away.	5.542353855233919
8136. he put in a call to cunningham from his hotel room.	10.821210074230747

8139. a woman named lisa who tells nobody	anything about herself.	9.18235949259096
8140. that courtyard picture with the same initials.	14.003139362917459
8141. i'm not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm.	4.788298956415828
8142. i'll call you in a day or so.	7.333679920970098
8143. on the highway he relaxed	and enjoyed the drive over lake pontchartrain and along the coast.	8.589164546551304

8145. he checked into a motel and drove downtown.	9.026368296067464
8146. the courthouse	was a white-stucco building minus the customary dome.	9.945332631078985
8147. instead of the	usual straggling privet hedges and patches of bare dirt in most small-town	squares the building was hemmed in by a semitropical growth of	camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably bright-green	shade of florist's grass.	5.30503119346154
8148. he figured his best bet was a call	on the sheriff.	10.090191208524187
8149. a clerk in the outer office took him in to sheriff	carruthers a big paunchy man with thick white hair and a voice with	a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher	office.	5.10872141717912
8150. seated in front of the desk hank said i'm	looking for some information with very little to go on sheriff.	8.982676827615084
8151. he explained the background of the case ending with the tenuous	clue which had brought him to gulf springs.	6.617122528051164
8152. the sheriff's	swivel chair tilted back.	13.848082117783294
8153. so you're looking for a woman who married	a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been poisoned.	7.123585709326093
8154. if there was such a person i'm afraid she got away with	it.	12.879976313416291
8155. pity we don't know more about him.	7.14162538120728
8156. i think the best bet is to	go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the grooms	match with the obituaries a little later.	0.0
8157. it'll be a tedious job	but if you want to try it the old newspaper files are in the basement	here in the county supervisor's office.	6.59993016091459
8158. maybe the society	editor would remember a good-looking out-of-town bride.	9.395032103808498
8159. mrs calhoun has been society editor here	for twenty-five years.	7.236036544386507
8160. the editor says that marriages may be made in	heaven but weddings are made in mrs calhoun's columns.	7.869517960695918
8161. she's	the one who decides which wedding is to get the lead space in the sunday	paper and all that.	6.4356593290155795
8162. once when the editor was	just out of the hospital from a gallstone operation mrs calhoun	and the mother of the bride went out to his house and fought it out	beside his bed.	8.717680440317418
8163. she'd be sure to remember any bride who was vague about	background.	6.837523265813775
8164. she'd have made a great scientist dedicated to tracking	down heredity and environment.	8.94539258099813
8165. she'd also remember if the groom	died later.	7.14162538120728
8166. i wish you good luck but please don't	dig up too tough a case for me this close to election.	8.06043223364679
8167. if you	find out anything come on back here and we'll get started on it.	6.955925656704601
8168. tracking down mrs calhoun was like trying to catch up with	paul revere between lexington and concord.	6.757567981697296
8169. it turned out that	she also sold real estate cosmetics and hospital insurance.	9.726423604138432
8170. the wearying	trek stretched into the afternoon- from newspaper plant to insurance	office to her house and back to the newspaper where he found	her at five o'clock.	7.050340870176075
8171. she was a large woman with a frizzled gray	poodle cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth while	she hunted and pecked on an old typewriter.	5.789543546066923
8172. it took a couple of minutes	to run through her various	businesses and get down to the one he wanted.	11.239179105540494
8173. last year?	18.727767094450044
8174.  well i do remember one.	13.443200471407982
8175. married a man named vincent black.	7.622507342753323
8176. i remember her because	she didn't want her picture in the paper.	9.959447090554608
8177. first bride like that i've	seen in twenty-five years.	8.220432045910607
8178. what reason did she give?	14.705292966559352
8179. 	said she had a breaking-out on her face- some sort	of allergy- and none of her old pictures was good enough.	5.183206139993373
8180. i didn't	see her till several days later at the wedding and her face looked	like it had never had a	blemish on it.	7.279247487033728
8181. but of course you couldn't	see too well through the veil.	8.215641403132352
8182. was her name lisa carmody?	13.079174627163688
8183. 	now how in hell would i remember that?	6.764147616291221
8184. 	never mind.	15.594944937291627
8185. i can look it up.	17.913769377325515
8186. do they still live here?	17.343125998324673
8187. 	i think they moved away shortly after they were married.	6.693352813081144
8188. he	was a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred.	8.476869120804196
8189. i'm sure it'll be in the files.	4.877992415049471
8190. we usually run a social note when	somebody moves away.	10.652339349247628
8191. he stood up and thanked her.	11.77462647684015
8192. have	they inherited some money or something?	9.670406878971576
8193.  she asked with a	reportorial gleam in her eye.	10.783825021342972
8194. he said vaguely well it is	a little legal matter but nothing like that.	10.83442379024602
8195. he hurried across	to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving.	7.920638428288746
8196. sounds like what you're after he said when hank had	finished.	8.04747279810431
8197. come on let's hurry down before they lock up for the	day.	6.205448813376699
8198. in the basement the sheriff took him to a small dingy	office occupied by a tall thin man informal in rolled-up shirt sleeves.	9.805401651012383
8199. mr ferrell h hirey lindsay chairman of the board	of supervisors.	8.409258203645024
8200. mr ferrell is a private detective hirey.	10.963282851070431
8201. wants	to look up something in the newspaper files so don't lock him	in here.	5.674295354649883
8202. i'll just leave the	door open.	6.321180167012423
8203. it latches when you close it so stay as long as you like.	10.156046623799684
8204. carruthers crossed the room to a metal door with an open	grillework in the top half.	8.27923604819206
8205. now don't shut this	door.	12.110551015220738
8206. it won't open from inside.	11.154645585787174
8207. before we built the new jail	we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail	got too crowded.	5.764451349658754
8208. hirey treats himself a lot better than we do prisoners.	7.879513779734377
8209. they were a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with	the cold air from hirey's air conditioner coming through the grille.	6.307736478796254
8210. he walked past the sheriff into a windowless room with	shelves full of big leather-bound volumes from floor to ceiling all	around the walls.	7.96930704519736
8211. a metal table and four chairs stood in the center.	7.190017756155806
8212. they're all here back to 1865 carruthers told him.	4.994720680638166
8213. it's all right to smoke but make sure your cigarettes are out	before you leave.	3.2047478629298873
8214. and of course you know not to take clippings.	12.873312048965388
8215. i'll leave the air conditioner on for you mr ferrell	said hirey.	4.433905627910279
8216. don't forget to turn it off and close the door	good so it'll latch.	4.44672359036832
8217. hank thanked them and promised to	observe the rules.	6.850114810505649
8218. when they had gone he stood for a minute breathing	in the mustiness of old paper and leather which the busily thrumming	air conditioner couldn't quite dispel.	7.766841735109365
8219. in	a tour around the stacks he found that the earliest volumes began on	the left and progressed clockwise around the room.	5.642616259681851
8220. an old weakness for	burrowing in records rose up to tempt him.	8.877774212290777
8221. it was indeed	all here- almost a century.	14.641503533571957
8222. from reconstruction to moon rockets.	14.156573540712236
8223. but	he pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to	the newer ones.	6.554912167734717
8224. last year's volume was at the top a couple	of inches below the ceiling.	10.825511014583325
8225. near it was a metal ladder on casters attached	to the top shelf.	7.7551840310656255
8226. he pulled it over climbed up and lifted out	the big volume almost losing his balance from the weight of it.	7.929184682861539
8227. he	staggered over and dropped it on the table.	8.035577201621102
8228. since mrs calhoun	remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring he started	to plod through several months.	9.787767525915806
8229. he tried to turn right to the society	page in each one but interesting stories kept cropping up to distract	him.	7.025763647171034
8230. at last he found it in the paper of april 2.	14.616503675183607
8231. it	told him little more than mrs calhoun had remembered stating that	it had been a small modest wedding compared to some of the others.	6.095122581173423
8232. there was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride	and groom.	16.192889663467273
8233. mr black's life was an open book so to speak from	his birth in jackson mississippi through his basketball-playing	days at lsu and his attainment of a ba degree which	had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager	for peerless business machines.	4.659455979211547
8234. the one line on the bride	said she was miss lisa carmody from baton rouge.	9.193310596115591
8235. no mention of	new orleans.	12.118415943366188
8236. hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for	mr black.	9.636977149378556
8237. if mrs black was who he thought she was mr black's	peerless selling days might well be over.	6.594248428022934
8238. now for their	exodus from gulf springs.	13.451882130550437
8239. this time the search took twice as long	cutting down on his extra reading for he had to pick through several	columns of one- and two-line social notes in each issue.	6.2549702122650555
8240. he found	it in the edition of may 15.	11.45143587764551
8241. the item said mr and mrs black	had moved to jackson his home town- so the lovely lisa had been	with him a year ago.	5.585139878273989
8242. next on his program was a call to the jackson	office of peerless business machines to find out if vincent	black was still with them- or more specifically still with us.	7.236879701826492
8243. he glanced at his watch saw it was only seven and decided	to indulge his weakness now.	6.905497562533933
8244. for the next hour he scrambled happily	up and down the ladder sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen	mckinley's assassination the iroquois theater fire in chicago	and the hall-mills trial.	7.868147602969172
8245. in the middle of the stock market	crash he heard a slight noise in the outer office.	12.03312557154632
8246. he turned around	saw nothing and decided it must be a mouse.	13.267880761992824
8247. something else distracted	him yet there was no sound only tomblike silence.	7.278341177021533
8248. then he knew	it was not sound but lack of it.	10.65442028724022
8249. the air conditioner was no longer	running.	11.753761152530181
8250. he jumped up and turned around to see the metal door	closing.	11.196645023628225
8251. it clanged shut as he sprang toward it.	10.553055984475764
8252. he pressed	his face against the grille.	13.671139498061125
8253. who's there?	12.292407525564322
8254.    the light	shining through the grille dimly illumined the office beyond- enough	for him to see there was no one there.	8.389931296239107
8255. then he heard the outer door	closing.	12.661119824071264
8256. hey come back he shouted.	10.472119682746735
8257. he thought it must	be some damn janitor or cleaning woman puttering around figuring	that hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock	hen the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind.	5.412304764872653
8258. unless	he was stone-blind the person who'd just left couldn't have missed	seeing hank through the open door of the brightly lighted room.	6.290129093830134
8259. and	even if he'd somehow missed seeing him he wouldn't have gone off	and left the light on and door open in the file room.	4.853876284793092
8260. whoever	it was had meant to shut him up in here had followed him and waited	till the courthouse and square were deserted.	6.290129093830134
8261. but why?	23.610825405413454
8262.  to search	his room at the motel?	13.963913492105547
8263.  to come back later and kill him after the stores	had closed around the square and everybody had left?	5.826157201172332
8264.  no they	could	kill him just as easy right now.	10.373067412998452
8265. nobody could hear what was going	on in this underground vault.	7.074972221877469
8266. then he heard it and smelled it-	the steady hissing the dread familiar pungency of gas escaping.	8.346640475382063
8267. it must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the	supervisors' office.	8.409649885469255
8268. until now lilac gaylor and lila kingsley	had been like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace	and choosing.	6.950343391068107
8269. except for those minutes in her room he had	lost touch with her as a reality.	7.240313487964337
8270. gaylor's obsession and cunningham's	chimera-chasing reminiscences had mesmerized him into thinking	of lila and lilac separately or together as a legend.	6.695600804677545
8271. they kept drifting	apart and merging again in his mind like some minute form of life	on a microscope slide.	6.575562975320866
8272. i take a little time to	think it over.	13.090374372322895
8273. it was awkward: very awkward.	19.850098703869534
8274. there would be all	the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over.	13.093706878838054
8275. and angie would hear about it.	10.242612813271945
8276. and angie knew-	time said angie and he smiled very sweet and slow at	mr skyros.	8.286483984364033
8277. not too much time because i'll be needing some	more myself pretty much right away.	6.779677044650418
8278. and i done favors for you big	favor not so long back didn't i and i'm right here to take on	where pretty left off.	7.754227061854244
8279. i don't want no trouble you	don't want no trouble nobody wants trouble mr skyros.	5.079249219856771
8280. dear heaven no thought mr skyros turning away as another	man came in.	7.487555314736928
8281. he straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand;	the genial smile seemed painted on his face.	6.034462242787552
8282. angie knew- speak	of dangerous information! angie knew too much entirely already.	7.615092762846159
8283. really	he had mr skyros at bay h   big favor i done	you.	6.002446559592496
8284. acourse there's this deal o' denny's- and jackie's-	kinda hangin' fire ain't it maybe you've been kinda worryin'	over that.	6.54093796655646
8285. and can't say i blame you said angie thoughtfully.	8.108856755126041
8286. this deal with the ace o' spades.	13.908088998499016
8287. anything to do with an ace	o' spades bad luck.	7.529616316293814
8288. ace of spades- a widow that was	what they called a widow these low-class crooks remembered mr skyros	distractedly.	6.643215071337043
8289. all about that angie knew too.	9.785091048588368
8290. when things got	a little out of hand they very rapidly got a lot out of hand- it seemed	to be a general rule.	7.507767164698912
8291. all just by chance and in a way tracing	back to poor frank all of it because naturally- brothers living	together- and angie-   mr skyros did not at all like the	look on angelo's regular-featured almost girlishly good-looking	face-	or indeed anything about angelo.	6.2412274068389255
8292. mr skyros was not a man	who thought very much about moral principles; he found money much more	interesting; but all the same he thought now uneasily of the way	in which angelo earned his living- and paid for his own stuff-	and eyed the soft smile and the spaniel-like dark eyes and he felt a	little ill.	6.1653632780786465
8293. look my friend he said in my life i	learn how is it the proverb says better an ounce of prevention to a	pound of cure.	6.832288342097768
8294. i stay in business so long because i'm careful.	10.853733375513935
8295. two	weeks a month we talk it over again and maybe if nothing happens	meanwhile to say the cops know this and that then we make a little deal	isn't it?	4.93949976615226
8296.    that's a long while said angie.	5.468102545442601
8297. i tell you you want to leave it that way i don't fool around	with it.	7.524180022603233
8298. i go over to castro and get fixed up there.	10.227318669010717
8299. i can't wait	no two weeks.	7.208042360095738
8300. and mr skyros didn't like angie but	what with prettyman and three of his boys inside and not likely	to come out- and angie such a valuable salesman prettyman said-	all the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a	whole new bunch of boys- why did everything have to happen at once?	5.978352254436964
8301. 	denny said stupidly why you ain't turning angie down	are you mr skyros?	5.825820622377272
8302.  i mean we all figured- i guess anybody'd	figure- angie-   angelo gave him an affectionate	smile.	9.035679962360328
8303. mr skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me	he said.	7.678257531010522
8304. it's ok denny everything's ok ain't	it mr skyros?	3.863108383896534
8305.    oh god the name repeated over	and over anybody to hear- not being a fool mr skyros knew	why.	5.628210636008765
8306. but aside from everything else it would scarcely be pleasant	to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually	held- you could say- the whip hand.	6.751872335660797
8307. and all because of domokous!	if mr skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would	eventually cause-   of course there was another factor.	6.3895676957563765
8308. angie	worth his weight in gold right now but these users they sometimes	went down fast.	7.032105024464237
8309. who knew angie might not last long h.	8.371261089032279
8310. the sweat broke out on mr skyros' forehead as he realized he had	been actually thinking- hoping- planning- perhaps-   good	god above had not domokous been enough?	6.593952525060604
8311.    he patted angelo's	thin shoulder paternally.	12.127026643485452
8312. now you don't want to go talking	that way he said.	9.470520492011609
8313. sure sure you're the one take over	for pretty soon as i get the supply get started up again isn't	it?	5.614160879069833
8314.  you don't need worry angelo.	9.048627110815454
8315. i tell you i know how it is	with you my friend i sympathize and i'll make it a special point-	a special favor- get in touch and get some stuff just for you.	5.465042616112157
8316. i don't know if i can manage it tonight or tomorrow but i'll try	my best my friend.	5.633688176138632
8317. you see you got to remember we all got schedules	like any business! my man he won't be around a little while	he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the elite.	5.455003109141211
8318. it's	awkward you see that isn't it?	10.671917681075756
8319.    well that's	your business mr skyros said angie and his dreamy eyes	moved past mr skyros' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground-glass	window.	5.424518203293881
8320. i appreciate it you do that.	14.42559352095188
8321. we don't none	of us want no trouble h.	6.691640786663204
8322. i'm in a room over the golden club on	san pedro you just ask for me there you want see me.	5.0634641869118795
8323. or maybe i	call you- tonight?	10.11539202387438
8324.  about nine o'clock i call and see if you	got any.	9.057616513164579
8325. a couple decks for me mr skyros- and ten-twelve to sell	see i like to have a little ready cash.	8.11496067311596
8326. oh now	i don't know about that much said mr skyros.	8.694360868414782
8327. and you know	angelo pretty he always keeps it a strict cash basis like they	say-   sure said angie.	7.030217467478371
8328. fifty a throw that the deal?	11.108380474026662
8329.  sure.	15.610129252044759
8330. i bring you the cash say five	hundred for ten decks.	10.227318669010717
8331. never mind how much i cut it how much i	get and he smiled his sleepy smile again.	5.670335198204905
8332. you go 'n' have a look round for it.	15.452984930131814
8333. i	do my best said mr skyros earnestly just for you my friend.	6.24263704224013
8334. this is awkward for everybody isn't it we all got to put up with	inconvenience sometimes.	10.420199611752704
8335. but i do my best for you.	16.47255736675988
8336. he got out	of there in a hurry brushing past another man in the door mopping	his brow.	9.616784129836086
8337. the expedient thing- yes very true one must make	do as one could in some situations.	6.461071090028369
8338. it could all be straightened out	later.	20.96677395736879
8339. not very much later but when things had settled down a little.	6.907330826728996
8340. after this deal with the bouvardier woman went through.	13.321239309323945
8341. an ace	of spades h.	11.135743088448892
8342. he was not a superstitious man but he felt perhaps	there was a little something in that indeed.	10.763100508743094
8343. he rather wished he	had never got into the business and still- scarcely to be resisted	a nice little profit with not much work involved easy money h	katya roslev who would be katharine ross so very soon now	rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change.	5.041920210571889
8344. she	did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without	a smile or a word of thanks.	7.234837298457544
8345. usually she marked the few who did	thank you you didn't get that kind much in a place like this: and	she played a little game with herself seeing how downright rude she	could act to the others before they'd take offense threaten to call	the manager.	4.672878704005991
8346. funny how seldom they did: used to it probably.	8.196044167676531
8347. the	kind who came into a cheap store like this! grab snatch i saw	that first! and here i'll take this i was before her	you wait on me now or i don't bother with it see! this kind of	place h   she'd be through here just no time at all- leave	this kind of thing 'way behind.	4.357708011480493
8348. off at noon and she'd never come	back.	11.536602410205571
8349. money- a lot of money enough.	11.731802124779977
8350. she'd	be smart about it get him to give it to her in little bills so's	nobody would suspect- maybe couldn't get it until monday account	of that the banks- but that wasn't really long to wait.	6.221074678776616
8351. not when	she'd waited so long already.	10.009742122044596
8352. no need say anything at all	to the old woman.	11.041665831751207
8353. she had it all planned out how she'd do.	9.238733424724364
8354. she'd	say she didn't feel good on sunday couldn't go to church- there'd	be a little argument but she could be stubborn- and when the	old woman had gone quick pack the things she'd need to take all	but the dress she'd wear monday and take the bag down to that place	in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight for	a dime.	5.596246723396514
8355. then on monday morning- or it might have to be tuesday-	get up and leave just the usual time and last thing put the money	in an envelope under the old woman's purse there in the drawer.	5.414245351425655
8356. she	wouldn't be going to get that for an hour or so after katya had left	go do the daily shopping.	7.661419136091847
8357. no need leave a note with it either-	or maybe just something like don't worry about me i'm going away	to make a better life.	5.4911936898726115
8358. it wasn't	as if she wanted much.	16.49084636425047
8359. she didn't mind working hard not as if	she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft- all she	wanted was a chance where she wasn't marked as what she was.	4.681921877515503
8360. to	be katharine ross and work in a nicer shop somewhere at a little	more money so she could have prettier clothes and learn ladies' manners	and all like that and get to know different people than up to now	not just the ones like her here with foreign-sounding names the	ones went to the same church and- different place different job different	people she'd be all different too.	5.855306997091811
8361. prettier she'd do her	hair another way; smarter and wear different kinds of clothes-	she'd be katharine ross just what that sounded like.	5.136160743688668
8362. you've give me the wrong change said the customer sharply.	5.926917732418019
8363. think	i can't count?	10.363724110347151
8364.    katya made up the amount in indifferent	silence.	9.060328853487057
8365. she was listening to other voices out of the future.	10.000901422611168
8366. some of those vaguely-imagined new different people.	16.09156408141647
8367. oh katharine's	awfully nice and pretty too i like katharine- let's	ask katharine to go with us she's always lots of fun- katharine-	soon very soon now h	mendoza	didn't	wake until nearly nine-thirty.	5.157337882595288
8368. it was going to be another hot	day; already the thermometer stood close to ninety.	13.986306783887729
8369. alison was still	sound asleep; he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk	drawers for more cigarettes before thinking of her handbag and found	a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom which tasted peculiarly	of face powder.	4.57895448454157
8370. he left a note propped on the desk asking her to call	him sometime today and drove home.	7.833904939808143
8371. after he'd got out fresh	liver for bast he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her	dish.	7.216918533241461
8372. surely she was just a trifle fatter around the middle?	8.932165256721609
8373.  he	seemed to remember reading somewhere that abyssinians had large litters	and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a	dozen kittens.	5.19227123965549
8374. y que sigue despues?	11.568363037656766
8375. - what then?	5.266673368210204
8376.  he	asked her severely.	13.148092146312546
8377. a lot of people are so peculiar that they don't	like cats it's not the easiest thing in the world to find good	homes for kittens- and damn it you know very well if i have them	around long impossible to give them away! and i suppose now that	you've finally grown up if a little late you'd go on producing	kittens every six months or so.	5.038096119989345
8378. yes well it's a pity to spoil your	girlish figure- which all those kittens would do anyway- but i	think when you've raised these we'll just have the vet fix it so	there won't be any more h.	6.3886479358227195
8379. i wonder if the carters would take one	h.	10.115608088918114
8380. and it's no good looking at me like that as she wound affectionately	around his ankles.	5.8667089842155855
8381. maude's long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up.	7.622507342753323
8382. happened to be in the	hall! happened to hear you quarrel about her! oh well you can't	really blame lolotte.	7.647810648037352
8383. she lost her beau to you.	9.987973641461945
8384. but	she was talking of emile when she saw the black line of the open door;	sarah remembered it clearly.	7.081287966153309
8385. i've got to	get busy.	4.990273077554887
8386. miss celie's taken to her bed with the door locked.	8.786764805970698
8387. she	opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you.	5.868459107627189
8388. here-	she thrust a bundle of keys strung on a thick red cord into sarah's	hand.	7.385355106484742
8389. not that there's much use in locking up the smokehouse	and the storehouse now.	7.486645811911694
8390. maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring	it down her throat.	7.879513779734377
8391. i don't want it sarah said firmly.	4.915412401357787
8392. well- i'll take it down with me as i go.	7.879513779734377
8393. maude swooped up the cup and hiked up her top hoop as if about to take	off with a racing start.	5.079775636272307
8394. at the door she turned back her roman nose	looking very long now and satiric.	11.365917115140025
8395. ben and lucien	have gone after them.	7.622507342753323
8396. it's just like that book your northern friend	wrote- except there aren't any ice floes to cross and no bloodhounds.	4.252466111521646
8397. i don't know mrs stowe h.	4.7491506386898426
8398. what can they	do if they find them?	14.603889071466684
8399.    they can't do anything.	13.36930593042626
8400. it's	silly childish running after them like that.	9.060328853487057
8401. but	of course the paterollers won't be of any help not with everything	so upset and that yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around	god knows where.	4.76581317220898
8402. she had swished away she had been gone for	a long time probably when sarah suddenly realized that she ought to	stop her pour out the coffee so no one would drink it.	7.125955597219856
8403. but then the	so-called coffee was bad enough at best cold it was all but undrinkable-	especially that cup!   she was deeply horribly sure	that lucien had filled it with opium.	5.8492545957946644
8404. she had quarreled with lucien	she had resisted his demands for money- and if she died by the provisions	of her marriage contract lucien would inherit legally not	only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboards in the office but	later when the war was over her father's entire estate.	6.500029345007494
8405. she	felt cold and hot sticky and chilly at the same time.	7.26104304359843
8406. now wait a	minute she told herself think about it; lucien is not the only person	in this house who could have put opium in that coffee.	7.424866357058852
8407. she	had lost a bottle of opium- but that was on the trip from new orleans.	6.61712600782368
8408. or someone had taken it during her first day at honotassa.	9.051424940628914
8409. yes	she had missed it after her talk with emile after dinner just	before emile was shot.	5.427950274147271
8410. rilly or glendora had entered her room while	she slept bringing back her washed clothes.	7.032105024464237
8411. so somebody else could	have come in too- then or later while she was out of the room.	7.699557171210962
8412. it	would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor.	7.6924205076212635
8413. it was	not very reasonable to believe that lucien had procured unprocurable	opium and come back to honotassa with a formed plan to murder her.	6.526896965308186
8414. he	didn't even know that she was there.	10.648531049792185
8415. and he certainly couldn't	have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she	was not the yielding- yes and credible fool he had every right to	expect.	5.743742669551544
8416. no he had been surprised unpleasantly surprised but surprised.	11.344530025335501
8417. then somebody else?	14.43160455482214
8418.  don't question rev had said don't	invite danger.	4.270701532995561
8419. her skin crawled: lolotte had told maude that	she was in the hall and the door was open.	6.254122446453258
8420. sarah had begun to tell	lucien of emile she had begun to question and a little draft had crept	across the room from the bedroom door open barely enough to show	a rim of blackness in the hall.	6.075970599553096
8421. so lolotte- or anybody- could have	listened and that somebody could have already been supplied with	the missing bottle of opium.	5.983463794619069
8422. that was not reasonable either.	22.836070195266753
8423. the opium had disappeared before emile's death and whoever shot him	could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen sarah's	own doubts and suspicions- and questions.	5.704609165304231
8424. she began to doubt	whether there had been in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup.	9.714154428711911
8425. so	suppose somebody only wished to frighten her so she would leave honotassa!	that made a certain amount of logic.	5.15576524365156
8426. added to the	argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it	had been still hot she might even have drunk some of it she wouldn't	have taken enough to kill her for she would have been warned by	its taste.	6.336437769264723
8427. it was merely an attempt to frighten her.	14.46262503352129
8428. she wouldn't go back to new york as maude suggested; she wouldn't	run like a scared cat.	10.044378826341275
8429. but- well she'd be very careful.	7.622507342753323
8430. she dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense	of normal everyday life.	8.171394947443085
8431. but before she left her room she dug	into her big moire bag took out the envelope holding her marriage contract	and the wax seal had been broken.	5.46911413810475
8432. so somebody else knew what	would happen to her father's money if she died.	8.330529772257353
8433. rev had known	all along.	9.118533821976325
8434. rev didn't need to break the wax seal read the contract	and find out.	7.198778874655976
8435. he could conceivably have wished to make sure; rev	loved honotassa it was like a part of his breath and body; rev	had stressed the need for money.	8.13063622690684
8436. rev would never have tried to give her	poison!   she thrust the envelope back in the bag; there	was no point in locking it up in the armoire now it was like locking	the barn after the horse was stolen.	7.4607387446924
8437. and in all likelihood by now	there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her	marriage contract.	10.556055018280114
8438. there was no point either in telling herself again	what a fool she'd been.	13.125676935851551
8439. she went downstairs and received another	curious shock for when glendora flapped into the dining room in	her homemade moccasins sarah asked her when she had brought coffee	to her room and glendora said she hadn't.	5.286153820897227
8440. too much work this morning	miss sarah- everybody gone like that-   sarah swallowed	past another kind of constriction in her throat.	8.19458779820395
8441. well then	who brought it?	12.076792408766652
8442.    miss maude.	20.11034579016859
8443. she come to the kitchen	and say she take it up to you.	7.787505388748069
8444. glendora put down a dish of lukewarm	rice.	9.060328853487057
8445. not much breakfast this morning.	11.172747016032117
8446. i don't know what we're	going to do miss sarah.	5.695623658910755
8447. we've got to eat	sarah said curtly because a chill crawled over her again.	4.635617967570337
8448. the rice wasn't dosed with opium	indeed it had no taste at all not a grain of salt.	7.735484842834032
8449. she ate what she	could and went out along the covered passageway with the rain dripping	from the vines.	5.955612518741647
8450. in the kitchen glendora was despairingly picking	chickens.	18.61348947387476
8451. get a basket sarah told her.	8.893662989748096
8452. we'll go to the	storehouse.	6.3309838780295875
8453. glendora dropped a chicken and a flurry of feathers	and went with her through the drizzle to the storehouse.	5.15576524365156
8454. sarah	found the right key and unlocked the door.	8.581436094141479
8455. it was a long	low room like a root cellar for it was banked up with soil and vines	had run rampant over that too.	7.689274648241199
8456. it was dark but dry and cool.	18.575160393141385
8457. she	doled out what glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried	peas eggs cornmeal a little salt.	5.236383152695367
8458. the shelves looked emptier than	when miss celie had shown her the storeroom and since the men from	the commissary had called; there were certainly now fewer mouths	to feed but there was less to feed them with.	6.920920809041023
8459. she took glendora to	the smokehouse unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still	a quantity of hams and sides of bacon hanging from the smoke-stained	rafters.	5.482414761694449
8460. they wouldn't go hungry not yet.	13.133843158043385
8461. and the fields	were green and growing.	12.420128637259614
8462. can't you possibly imagine what life is	going to be like here?	8.03518957237222
8463.  maude had said.	10.363724110347151
8464. she	sent glendora back to the house her basket and her apron laden.	9.551289296197064
8465. she	stood for a moment rain dripping from the trees over her head thinking	of maude.	6.473005157560076
8466. maude had the opportunity to take the bottle	of opium from sarah's room.	9.336189346519962
8467. maude had the cool ruthlessness to d	o	whatever she made up her mind to do.	5.542917982132687
8468. she couldn't see how her death	could affect maude.	10.749202706058774
8469. she couldn't see any reason why maude would	attempt to frighten her.	7.187557404882245
8470. besides there was something hysterical and	silly something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her.	8.065136868315244
8471. maude	was neither hysterical nor silly and sarah rather doubted if she	had ever	been childish.	5.674295354649883
8472. yet maude had suggested that sarah return to	new york.	9.663652451954288
8473. maude could have shot emile- if she'd had a reason	to kill him.	5.825820622377272
8474. there was no use in standing there in the drizzle	trying to find a link between emile's murder and opium in a cup	of coffee.	10.616315231318696
8475. she started back for the house saw a light in the	office opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was	far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder.	4.934822565632548
8476. rev george	and lolotte were mending shoes.	9.670406878971576
8477. a lighted lamp stood on the	table that dusky drizzling day.	7.190017756155806
8478. they were all three bent over a shabby	riding boot; george had a tack hammer.	9.012331219925015
8479. lolotte held a patch of	leather rev steadied something a tiny brad waiting for george's	poised hammer.	5.427950274147271
8480. george said first thing i do when i get to vicksburg	again is get me a yankee-   with boots on	lolotte laughed softly.	6.81648064755476
8481. rev looked up and saw her.	8.138356006435677
8482. lolotte	looked up and stiffened.	11.568363037656766
8483. george didn't look up at all.	8.445737513828405
8484. there was	no way to know no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised	at sarah's appearance believing her to be drugged and senseless-	and just possibly dead.	8.771625658930137
8485. rev said come in sarah.	8.254441635698543
8486. reckon	you know the news.	11.568363037656766
8487. and what news sarah thought as satirically	as maude might have said it.	7.9964950820468115
8488. rev's face was suddenly	a little fixed and questioning.	8.581436094141479
8489. he turned to george and lolotte.	13.771695597620136
8490. take	your cobbler's shop somewhere else.	10.472119682746735
8491. i want to talk to sarah.	22.49736982182001
8492. everything in the office the spreading circle of lamplight	the patch of leather in lolotte's hands.	9.22839341710695
8493. george poised with the	tack hammer the homely everyday atmosphere all denied an attempt	at murder.	5.8679005668943764
8494. a rush of panic caught sarah.	11.87006678428286
8495. i mean	i've got to- to see to the kitchen.	9.286130580420084
8496. glendora-   her words	jumbled together and she all but ran from the office and from the	question in rev's face.	6.54093796655646
8497. now why did i do that?	11.878755024467265
8498.  she thought	as warm drizzling rain touched her face.	10.749202706058774
8499. she was no schoolgirl	refusing to bear tales.	10.731278724007474
8500. as she reached the kitchen door the answer	presented itself; if she told anyone of the opium it must be lucien	her husband.	8.282952476612262
8501. it might be indeed it had already proved	to be a marriage without love but it was marriage.	9.168487504431559
8502. so she couldn't	choose rev as a confidant; it must be lucien.	10.614633475499602
8503. always provided	that lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium she thought	as coldly and sharply again as maude might have said it.	4.901044106437365
8504. she paused at the kitchen door caught her breath told herself firmly	that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into	the kitchen where glendora was eyeing the chickens dismally and maude	was cleaning lamp chimneys.	6.14640984513995
8505. miss sarah	i can't cut up no chicken.	8.204171224594582
8506. miss maude say she won't.	12.406760308875619
8507. again the homely everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious	attempt to frighten her- or to murder her.	6.102397759864512
8508. the homely everyday	details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her	with their immediate urgency.	8.214965265260524
8509. no matter what had happened or hadn't	happened	somebody had to see about dinner.	10.974922879179479
8510. she eyed the chickens with if she	had known it something of glendora's dismal look and thought with	a certain fury of the time she had spent on latin verbs.	7.36901704271917
8511. i didn't think there was any reason	to.	6.958609338716115
8512. speak to him again anyway.	12.216031715840696
8513. try	talking to some of the fellows he works with friends anyone.	6.9843140455529555
8514. try	to find out how happy he is with his wife whether he plays around with	women.	8.668914804097579
8515. you might try looking into his wife too.	11.967604678295304
8516. she might have been	talking to some of her friends about her husband if they've been	having any trouble.	7.934196431965807
8517. you think black's the one we're	looking for?	10.644218033232553
8518.    yeah.	19.804021762487697
8519. i think he might be conrad	said grimly.	17.020628296415524
8520. then again he might not.	14.68659254202811
8521. what a stinking	world rourke said.	13.767756760564918
8522. black is gilborn's best friend.	10.781294570796428
8523. will you be coming back soon?	10.966798256760931
8524. 	i think so.	13.148092146312546
8525. i'm on my way to see the jacobs woman.	6.124526418672701
8526. gilborn's secretary?	15.594944937291627
8527.  what for?	20.454815948573874
8528.  you don't think gilborn	is the-?	9.048627110815454
8529.    i don't think anything.	5.50021416627485
8530. i just don't	want to go off half-cocked before picking up black that's all.	9.764540737582454
8531. gilborn says he was in his office all day with	her yesterday.	7.820337989471709
8532. i'd like to make sure.	7.734564608899882
8533. also it's just possible	she might know something about mrs gilborn.	6.833928345948588
8534. aren't you ever going to go home?	6.896026824155868
8535. 	it sure as hell doesn't look like it does it?	6.210871206873012
8536. 	i'm telling you if these corpses ever knew the trouble they put us	to they'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off.	6.221143152558621
8537. remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet.	8.215704716937493
8538. conrad hung up and sat on the small telephone-booth bench massaging	his right leg.	7.416915079765888
8539. he looked at his watch.	12.127026643485452
8540. it was ten minutes	before eleven.	28.25013444670347
8541. he wondered how long it would be before they	had a signed confession from lionel black.	7.189616737976169
8542. thirty years' experience	let him know even at this early stage that black was his	man.	7.874262680844115
8543. but he still wanted to know why.	13.80038671629586
8544. it was a cold windy	day the day after kitti's death but stanley gilborn paid no	attention to the blustery october wind.	9.911348151356
8545. after leaving conrad	gilborn had no destination.	10.205456107617097
8546. he simply walked not noticing where	he was not caring.	10.697093789223626
8547. he stopped automatically at the street corners	waiting for the traffic lights to change unheeding of other people his	coat open and flapping.	5.6945138009050655
8548. as he walked he tried to think.	17.963187923472443
8549. mainly of what conrad had tried to make	him believe.	7.531731278633359
8550. there was nothing coherent about his thinking.	21.672044027557128
8551. it was a succession of picture-images passing through his mind: the	same ones different ones in no apparent sequence in no logical succession.	7.345866721976695
8552. the enormity of what conrad had told him made it impossible	for gilborn to accept with any degree of realism the actuality	of it.	6.852952259467768
8553. conrad's words had intellectual meaning for him only.	6.764147616291221
8554. emotionally they penetrated him not at all.	9.060328853487057
8555. whoever he	was and your wife were intimate.	7.7245158053748435
8556. gilborn remembered conrad's	exact words.	11.568363037656766
8557. they made sense and yet they didn't.	11.134636204353644
8558. he knew conrad	had told him the truth.	15.499957972613625
8559. yet it wasn't so.	19.41154013237409
8560. it wasn't	so because it couldn't be so.	14.718704829380005
8561. when kitti was alive-	and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his arm-	she had been the center of his life.	7.653676529527218
8562. she was the sun he the	closest planet orbiting around her the rest of the world existing	and visible yet removed.	11.716273018375269
8563. for fifty-five years he had lived progressing	towards a no-goal eating working breathing without plan	without reason.	7.017380987871936
8564. kitti had come along to justify everything.	9.060328853487057
8565. she	was his goal she was his reason.	7.240698345721332
8566. he had lived all his life waiting	for her.	14.825353590384896
8567. not once in the time that he had known her had he	ever considered the possibility not once not for one one-thousandth	of a second of her infidelity.	5.985271672307656
8568. he could not consider it now.	19.714635232489073
8569. and so he walked aimless again.	13.712121456749493
8570. the walk ended	inevitably right in front of his hotel building.	12.744313978467405
8571. the doorman began	to nod his head automatically then remembered who gilborn was what	had happened to him the night before.	5.670580783382225
8572. he looked at gilborn with undisguised	curiosity.	13.671139498061125
8573. gilborn passed by him without seeing him.	7.14162538120728
8574. he crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own	thoughts.	10.437905228411026
8575. in the apartment itself all was still.	13.340672195401854
8576. the police	were no longer there.	13.848082117783294
8577. there was no evidence that anything was different	than it had been.	12.599057829330114
8578. except that kitti wasn't there.	14.345513138283163
8579. without taking off his coat he sat in the blue chair which still	faced the closed bedroom door.	6.79173550914331
8580. at last sitting there in the	familiar surroundings the truth began to sink in.	9.843819290377025
8581. who?	15.610129252044759
8582. 	he felt no anger towards kitti no sense that she had betrayed	him.	8.261013827652203
8583. who?	15.610129252044759
8584.    she was all he had everything he had	everything he wanted.	10.850667502179856
8585. someone had taken her away from him.	7.365861925614422
8586. who?	19.804021762487697
8587.    where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger there	is a right-hand one he remembered from his school days.	6.389851268424053
8588. where	there is a victim there is a killer.	9.977768095358806
8589. who?	15.610129252044759
8590. 	whoever he was and your wife were intimate.	9.192405724452508
8591. he rose from	the	chair took off his coat.	9.783357976961607
8592. quickly he went into the bedroom.	12.779238668117822
8593. the bed still showed signs of where kitti had lain.	7.916518503319115
8594. gilborn stood	there for a long time.	12.158732307866531
8595. he looked at the bed unblinkingly.	11.891161577655778
8596. the	bed was empty now.	11.568363037656766
8597. kitti would lie in it no more.	7.850150404389864
8598. he would lie in	it no more.	17.079919625167907
8599. gilborn wondered whether kitti had lain in that	same bed with h who?	5.825820622377272
8600.    for thirty minutes stanley gilborn	stood there.	13.154570381686497
8601. at the end of the half-hour racking his brains	thinking over and over again of kitti her friends her past he	left the bedroom.	9.785777327827452
8602. who?	19.804021762487697
8603.    he could think of no answer.	12.951914593399259
8604. gilborn put on his coat again.	9.670406878971576
8605. before leaving he took one	last lingering look at the apartment.	8.592409793513852
8606. he knew he would never	see it again.	20.908405040082005
8607. in the street walking as quickly as he could stanley	gilborn was a lone figure.	9.174032131229543
8608. on blanche jacobs kitti	gilborn's death had a quite different effect.	10.900545364036642
8609. for blanche kitti's	death was a source of guilty but nonetheless soaring happy hope.	7.563568252970948
8610. in blanche's defense it must be said she was unaware of	the newborn hope.	11.819658432061997
8611. if anyone had asked her she would have described	herself only as nervous and worried.	7.618242334714883
8612. the figures on the worksheet	paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it	was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with	the typewriter.	0.0
8613. she wondered whether stanley would call.	9.987973641461945
8614. she	wanted to be with him to give him the comfort and companionship she	knew he needed.	8.116950265146208
8615. she had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that	he might call while she was out.	7.019453667774309
8616. and now she was feeling	sick both from concern about stanley and hunger.	9.884804960254113
8617. why hadn't	he called?	14.589704088091107
8618.    men she reflected even men like stanley	are unpredictable.	10.016447084567874
8619. she tried to think of his unpredictable	actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they weren't	so many after all.	5.901780279423045
8620. stanley really was quite predictable.	10.472119682746735
8621. that was one of the things she liked about stanley.	16.300127509357768
8622. he wasn't like	so many other men.	13.671139498061125
8623. the dentist last night for instance.	11.987670074464091
8624. dinner and	the movies had been fine.	9.670406878971576
8625. he had taken her upstairs to say good night.	10.668434029746681
8626. she had invited him in for coffee.	13.827554352033255
8627. it was in the kitchen	as she was watching the kettle waiting for the water to boil that	he had grabbed for her.	9.074661271996286
8628. without warning without giving her a chance	to prepare for it.	8.563655938579043
8629. from behind he had put his arms on her shoulders	turned her around and pressed her to him so close she couldn't breathe.	5.58067940057007
8630. later she apologized for the long scratch across his face	tried to explain she couldn't help herself that the panic arose	in her unwanted.	7.367244510988014
8631. when he left she knew	she would never see him again.	9.645249236254678
8632. she	could always predict what stanley was going to do ever since she	first met him.	9.751676015249304
8633. except for that one morning.	15.164675143943152
8634. the morning he walked	in to announce to her blushing that he was married.	9.44856474191715
8635. she thought	she was going to die.	12.77962278314772
8636. she had assumed before then that one	day he would ask her to marry him.	9.521827725547784
8637. blanche couldn't remember	when she had first arrived at this conclusion.	6.6645365289240015
8638. she thought it was	sometime during the second week she worked for stanley.	9.874012228597989
8639. it was nothing	that he said or did but it seemed so natural to her that she	should be working for him looking forward to his eventual proposal.	6.345247763375443
8640. she was thirty-one years old then.	15.13507571649706
8641. her mother was already considerably	concerned over her daughter's future.	8.891874781149482
8642. but blanche had been	able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed	mother's continued carping had been able to resist her urgings	to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of matrimony.	8.11087090081096
8643. for blanche it was only a matter of time before stanley would	propose.	9.55179778219634
8644. it was to be expected that stanley would be shy slow in	taking such a momentous step.	13.22947658216411
8645. stanley went along in life she knew	convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman.	5.506076945773804
8646. as a result	he never looked for it.	15.374567042186891
8647. but one day she expected he would	somehow discover without her having to tell him that there was such	a woman in the world; a woman who was willing to give him love faith	and anything else a woman could give a husband.	6.120523064131836
8648. indeed there was	a woman who unasked had already given him love.	8.768237022924117
8649. and then unexpectedly stanley made his	announcement.	11.80912527055154
8650. on that first day blanche literally thought	she was going to die or at the very least go out of her mind.	9.198017333143694
8651. it might have been easier for her if kitti walker hadn't been	everything that blanche was not.	8.984594969870324
8652. kitti was thirty years younger	than stanley taller than stanley prettier than stanley had any	right to hope for much less expect.	6.365727389270327
8653. kitti could have married a score	of men.	7.14162538120728
8654. there was no reason for her to marry someone like stanley	gilborn there was no need for her to marry stanley.	11.552410952191142
8655. kitti	had come into the office on somebody's recommendation because she	needed help in preparing her income tax return.	5.712448943692012
8656. stanley had	filled out the return and because when he was finished it was close	to the lunch hour he had politely asked kitti to join him never expecting	her to accept.	6.3765988367382045
8657. blanche knew all this because the door	to stanley's office was open and without straining too hard she could	hear everything that was said.	5.080801149100255
8658. stanley had gone out saying	he would be back in an hour.	8.144711817614684
8659. he hadn't come back for over two.	9.783357976961607
8660. after that day blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened.	10.476221694696738
8661. there were mornings when stanley came in late afternoons when	he left early days when he didn't come in at all.	7.515302613951942
8662. blanche	knew something must be causing stanley's new strange behavior but	she never once connected it with kitti walker.	6.643215071337043
8663. then six weeks after the day kitti first came into the office	stanley announced he and kitti were married.	5.964961979798781
8664. somehow blanche	managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulations.	9.091292455335491
8665. that night the two of them left for a week's honeymoon	in acapulco.	10.098960131034632
8666. while they were away blanche came into the office	every morning running things as she had always run them for stanley	going through the week in a dazed stupor getting things done automatically	out of habit.	6.36927500317984
8667. for exactly one week she was able to	continue in this manner.	8.074508196225132
8668. on the morning of stanley's return	however her strength left her.	15.126101462726666
8669. two hours of watching his serenely	happy face listening to his soft humming as he bent over his penciled	figures and blanche had to leave.	5.279452207589045
8670. she stayed away for ten	days.	14.140224473190667
8671. those ten days were like no others that blanche had known.	7.012877753432631
8672. mostly she stayed in bed.	10.472119682746735
8673. she didn't tell anyone even her	mother what was wrong.	6.181144455223438
8674. she refused to have a doctor insisting there	was nothing a doctor could do for her.	9.807254661270614
8675. right said the fingerprint man.	8.689258769277684
8676. also if you're going	to believe those prints you'll have to look for a killer who's	a top-grade piano player.	8.72652226096617
8677. he demonstrated by playing an	imaginary piano doing a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack.	6.512874137333827
8678. to make it clearer he shifted to acting out but with no change	of manner the killing of rose mallory.	9.305401855878758
8679. his hands snatched at an	imaginary bucket swooping down hard to grab it and coming away with equal	snap like a ball that's been bounced hard.	5.237210997972282
8680. in the same way he	pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that pressing his	hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that.	9.803249236355153
8681. he was moving	like a ballet dancer playing for laughs.	10.068881193379493
8682. if rose mallory's killer	acted this way catching up with him was going to be a cinch.	12.0856416382172
8683. we'd	know him by his stretch pants and the flowers he'd wear twined	in his hair.	5.7458677294699
8684. perhaps if felix had first come upon us when this	boy was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall outside the murdered	woman's apartment we might have had less trouble convincing felix	of our seriousness.	7.433762215810269
8685. this you will remember was still new year's	day.	9.615268738713864
8686. by the time felix turned up it was early afternoon which one	would think would be late enough so that by then except for small children	and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up it could have	been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active	interest in the previous night's noisemakers and paper hats.	6.450508962282604
8687. he had retained his hat and his horn	and	whatever fun might still be going he was ready to join it.	7.476892573841137
8688. that incidentally	might give you some idea of what felix was like.	12.76842580414058
8689. after	all he hadn't happened upon us in that second-floor hall without warning.	6.98750989448313
8690. the me's boys had finished their on-the-spot examination	and the body had been removed for autopsy.	7.860799503526907
8691. the meat wagon therefore	was not out in front of the house any more but the cluster	of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs	to screen any comings and goings.	7.339088819151728
8692. there was furthermore the	crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a couple more cops	to hold them at a decent distance.	9.543902452145767
8693. just put yourself in felix's	place for a moment.	8.413536396092379
8694. you're a taxpayer householder landlord.	8.387192178320554
8695. you've been away from home for the new year festivities but now	the party is over and you come home.	7.9404363383742
8696. defining sobriety in the limited	sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol	ingested and not yet eliminated from the system you are sober.	6.933472784274669
8697. you still have your paper hat and you're wearing it but then	it is an extraordinary paper hat and in addition to anything else	you may be you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame	out in the back yard.	6.390492455147965
8698. it's not too much to assume that you will	have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will mr average	citizen.	4.874337927276783
8699. you have your paper horn clutched in your big craggy	fist and for your entrance you have planned a noisy colorful and exuberant	greeting to your friends and tenants.	5.81521380143089
8700. you find your house a	focus of public and police attention.	12.284191492130638
8701. can you imagine yourself forgetting	under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and	unexpected situation so unsuitably hatted and armed with a paper horn?	6.133164472548032
8702. 	maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness.	9.060328853487057
8703. you shoulder	your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to	the	cop on the door.	6.453812639777503
8704. you identify yourself and ask him what's going	on.	12.37182052821836
8705. instead of answering you he sticks his head in the door and shouts	up the stairs.	8.72487064618342
8706. got the upstairs guy he bellows.	9.670406878971576
8707. do i send him up?	12.385585473978882
8708.  then he turns back to you.	14.75323684227731
8709. go	on in he says.	9.118533821976325
8710. they'll tell you what's cooking.	7.147958626185755
8711. even then as you go into the house oppressed by the knowledge that	something is cooking and that your house has passed under this unaccountable	official control could you go on forgetting that you still had	that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish	horn in your hand?	4.7020893957538235
8712.    what i'm getting at is that we	were fully prepared for felix's being an odd one.	8.087649514528723
8713. we'd seen his	handiwork out in the back yard and the little his tenants had told us	of him did make him sound a little special.	6.140771269796904
8714. we were not however prepared	for anything like the apparition that confronted us as felix came	up the stairs.	8.296669767799466
8715. he of course must have been equally unprepared for	what confronted him but nonetheless i did find his reaction startling.	6.337708441306526
8716. if felix was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn	because he'd forgotten about them he now remembered.	7.876372381859706
8717. he came bounding	up the stairs and joined the dance.	9.03924404501138
8718. he adjusted the hat lifted	the horn to his lips as though it were a flute and fell in alongside	our fingerprint expert to cavort with him.	7.885336595922754
8719. our man stopped	dead and glowered at felix.	7.947892702378575
8720. felix threw his head back and laughed a	laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house.	6.44893033609597
8721. this	was a bull of a man.	7.738906147426005
8722. he was big-chested big-shouldered and heavy-armed.	17.218119440805356
8723. his face was ruddy and heavy and unlined and when he laughed	he showed his teeth which were big and white and strong and unquestionably	home-grown.	5.707245175293
8724. i don't remember ever seeing teeth that were quite	so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not dentures.	7.591118861513021
8725. his	hair had receded most of the way to the back of his neck.	12.56892882781233
8726. he had only	a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short.	10.584718158349082
8727. it was almost as white	as his teeth.	14.641503533571957
8728. for a man of his mass he was curiously short.	16.718297747699378
8729. he	wasn't a dwarf but he was a bit of a comic figure.	8.406573142447122
8730. a man with so big	and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arms	is expected to stand taller than five feet five.	7.901110230605235
8731. for felix it was	a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement.	6.800157167832778
8732. the man was just this	side of being a freak.	15.114924232240053
8733. we waited till he had finished laughing	and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him.	7.058240791614236
8734. he was dressed	in a manner esquire might suggest for the outdoor man's	country weekend.	10.107316701574787
8735. dark gray sports jacket lighter gray slacks pink flannel	shirt black silk necktie.	5.825820622377272
8736. he was freshly	shaved and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have	missed detecting some scent of it on the massive gusts of his laughter.	8.502807620570369
8737. eventually he subsided.	11.8483760059492
8738. me he said merrily.	11.568363037656766
8739. that much latin we remember gibby said dryly.	9.526797988050147
8740. you	always live up to your name always like this always making happy?	7.960896024375595
8741. 	i try felix said blithely.	8.254441635698543
8742. the world is full	of blokes who put their hearts into making the tragic scene.	10.81707563770094
8743. i've	never noticed that it improves things any.	7.14162538120728
8744. bully for you	gibby said.	11.568363037656766
8745. what's the rest of your name?	9.37614097797751
8746.    no	rest of it.	13.148092146312546
8747. felix is all there is.	8.254441635698543
8748. all there ever	was?	18.785191397009886
8749.    the past i leave to historians felix intoned	demonstrating that he could be pompous as well as happy.	8.148928243478009
8750. you	live in the present?	11.568363037656766
8751.    in the present felix proclaimed.	21.10661177297555
8752. is there any other time in which a man	can live?	20.282429848895468
8753.    we gibby announced are not philosophers.	10.717432709549398
8754. we are assistant district attorneys.	18.739327465619887
8755. this gentleman is a police	officer.	11.309843967689007
8756. he is a fingerprint specialist.	25.93515017014358
8757. could your future your	immediate future be made to include taking us upstairs giving us a	bit of space in which our friend can work and making available to him	your finger tips?	5.204019036503638
8758.    the happy one could never have looked	happier.	11.387658710676023
8759. this was more than joy.	18.79457919610455
8760. those lovely	whorls he chortled.	15.48680556789494
8761. come right	along.	13.358238354611412
8762. he was prancing along the	hall heading for the next flight of stairs.	11.80205717104242
8763. we're here because of what happened last night he said.	4.959839302579545
8764. since it is important for the record	let's have the full name.	16.368395141901278
8765. grubb felix whispered.	10.363724110347151
8766. felix grubb?	15.594944937291627
8767.  gibby asked not bothering to whisper.	7.622507342753323
8768. i can't see what would	make it necessary for you to know.	7.663517800062761
8769. nothing could make it necessary	to proclaim it to the whole world.	8.156284398491698
8770. obligingly gibby lowered	his voice.	11.568363037656766
8771. edmund but	not for years.	9.118533821976325
8772. for years it's been just felix.	14.79291949875697
8773. first thing i did	after my twenty-first birthday was go into court and have it officially	changed and this is something i don't tell everybody.	6.113610504660716
8774. that was	almost forty years ago.	14.860954966088402
8775. having volunteered that he was a man	of about sixty he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered	the number less credible.	5.965893828052757
8776. this was a broth of a boy our felix and	nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in demonstrating how agile	he was and how full of juice and spirit.	7.116662134239656
8777. we followed him up the	stairs.	12.05380807745023
8778. the cops would gather up connor and the foursome on the third	floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting.	6.673055462121845
8779. you may think we didn't need nancy and jean	but you always get what you can when you can and we had no guarantee	that a fingerprint record on them couldn't be useful before we were	through with this case.	5.756679457912886
8780. also if we had excluded the ladies we would	have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where	we stood.	7.547645701797818
8781. the killer if in our present group would certainly be	interested in knowing that much and even though with the fingerprint	evidence what it was i could see no way he could use this bit of information	to improve on his situation there might always be some way.	4.959572764290091
8782. if	you can possibly avoid it you don't hand out any extra chances.	8.883275713755397
8783. felix took us into his studio.	7.622507342753323
8784. it was that oddly shaped space	at the very top of the house where ceiling heights had to accommodate	themselves to the varying angles of roof slope.	10.05640553745738
8785. at each angle of its	pitch a big skylight had been fitted into the roof and all these skylights	were fitted with systems of multiple screens and shades.	5.428652167232112
8786. when felix first opened the door on it all these shades were tightly	drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night.	7.610862794686664
8787. he quickly fixed	that rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens	on the others.	8.029251850285515
8788. he flew about the place making these adjustments	and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience.	8.968429210444997
8789. none of his movements was tentative.	12.216451405619546
8790. there was no process of	trial and error.	22.924278735431567
8791. starting with the room completely blacked out as it	was when we came in he unerringly fixed things so that the whole place	was bathed in the maximum of light without at any point admitting	even so much as a crack of glare.	5.697585042985711
8792. expecting something more-than-average	wacky i was surprised by what we found.	8.407375448349137
8793. there was no display	of either works in progress or of finished work.	11.028689644663492
8794. here and there on	work table or pedestal stood a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin draped	over it.	9.066524905828398
8795. these shapes might have been mad but there was no telling.	9.9197496666572
8796. they were all completely shrouded.	17.200385848198177
8797. the equipment was solid and heavy	and in good condition.	7.839212140222358
8798. everything was orderly and it seemed to be	arranged for the workman's comfort convenience and efficiency.	8.442313815843075
8799. there	were tools about but they were neatly kept.	6.850114810505649
8800. there was no confusion	and no litter.	26.84798141185944
8801. supplies of sheet metal were neatly stacked in bins.	6.460370037324521
8802. andy did not see the newspapers the next day.	8.757497432238598
8803. someone on his staff-	he suspected it was ed thornburg- intercepted them and for	this andy was grateful.	5.417864100942573
8804. he finally fell asleep around six in	the morning with the aid of a sleeping capsule a crutch he rarely used	and didn't awaken until early afternoon.	7.521068863432583
8805. memory flooded him the	instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach.	6.13161733164259
8806. outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day.	9.832541831122397
8807. presumably	the same sun was shining upon little drew also and those who had kidnapped	him.	6.5094034409193355
8808. but where?	29.954223479466464
8809.  it was still a very big world despite all	the modern cant to the contrary.	10.600745728087816
8810. hub was sitting in a chair that	blocked the hall door.	8.243676170711876
8811. he was dozing perhaps the only sleep he'd	gotten.	10.939493574783542
8812. he snapped to alertness at andy's entrance.	12.411802052220429
8813. lot of people waiting to see you though.	8.702845755001738
8814. questions	about the show tonight.	11.568363037656766
8815. hub picked up the telephone.	10.08935131099144
8816. shall i	let them know you're awake?	10.014864794069384
8817.    i suppose.	22.589978126100267
8818. how's lissa	do you know?	11.568363037656766
8819.    hub considered.	12.292407525564322
8820. she's	got plenty of guts mr paxton.	9.670406878971576
8821. you want me to call her?	11.823504411807077
8822. 	she expecting me to?	11.568363037656766
8823.  hub shook his head so andy told	him not to bother.	6.857357770287108
8824. the only reason for contacting lissa was to comfort	or to be comforted.	9.812040372724129
8825. he could not manage the former or expect the	latter; they had nothing to give to each other.	8.067622966735081
8826. the omission might	look peculiar to outsiders but andy could not bring himself to go through	the motions simply for the sake of appearances.	7.685114464303618
8827. he had little	time to himself anyway.	13.541236459959519
8828. as the afternoon sped toward evening	the suite saw a steady procession of paxton aides pass in and out each	with his own special problem.	9.53573528752452
8829. thornburg arrived with the writers.	8.254441635698543
8830. they had spent the morning revising the act eliminating all the gay	songs patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations.	8.94231714556467
8831. what	remained lacked the original verve but it was at least dignified	as befitting the tragic circumstances.	6.693298919029093
8832. raymond fox reported that the	orchestra had hastily rehearsed cradle song in case it was needed.	6.94139604275856
8833. charlie marble was back and forth on several occasions first	to confer with andy on the advisability of cancelling the las vegas	engagement- they decided it was wise- and later to announce that	a prominent comedian also an agency client had agreed to fill the casino's	open date.	4.95255573613254
8834. and once bake slipped in pale and drawn last	night's liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it.	8.64579541271297
8835. he asked if there was anything he could do.	10.537741318730712
8836. andy invented a job to	keep him busy sending him ahead to el dorado to supervise last minute	arrangements.	6.643215071337043
8837. but from rocco vecchio they heard nothing.	12.007487675745756
8838. at last it was time to depart.	16.90519436425001
8839. hub nosing about spotted	reporters in the lobby so andy was hustled away quietly through the	hotel's service entrance in a strange car which hub had procured somewhere.	4.726707772215755
8840. they succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel but	there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub.	8.877019185953573
8841. el dorado	was surrounded by a mob.	7.980160196327959
8842. they overflowed the parking lot making progress	by automobile difficult.	10.372209341984666
8843. long before he reached the protection of	the stage door andy was recognized.	7.5721017313365895
8844. word of his arrival spread through	the crowd like a brushfire.	9.425215411485208
8845. they surged around him fingers pointing	eyes prying.	9.433178351824823
8846. it was not a hostile gathering but andy sensed the	difference from last night's hero-worshippers.	13.557666977591778
8847. they had come not	to admire but to observe.	11.216186743914033
8848. it's worse inside thornburg	informed andy.	3.6130210406737766
8849. skolman's jammed in every table he could find.	6.764147616291221
8850. under the heading of it's an ill wind et cetera.	11.12619541457907
8851. backstage	was tomblike by contrast.	9.118533821976325
8852. andy's co-workers kept their distance	awed by the tragedy.	8.581436094141479
8853. but in his dressing room was a large bouquet	and a card that read we're with you all the way.	6.751469327788575
8854. it was signed	by everyone in the troupe.	18.575160393141385
8855. andy couldn't help but be touched.	7.622507342753323
8856. he instructed shirl winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted	on the call board.	8.397071238534748
8857. bake was waiting to report that lou duvol	had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently.	8.067590657033387
8858. andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment.	8.624067516896236
8859. bake himself	looked better; any kind of job was better than brooding.	8.774320246351223
8860. andy told him bake i wish you'd talk to skolman see if	some kind of p a system can be rigged up outside.	6.221143152558621
8861. it's just barely	possible with this crowd that the kidnapper wasn't able to get	a table.	3.2557901078091316
8862. i wouldn't want him to miss the message.	12.638351179589593
8863. skolman isn't going to like it much though giving away	what he should be selling.	6.170148623671804
8864. skolman wasn't the only one who	didn't care for andy's scheme.	9.060923381674275
8865. a short time later lieutenant	bonner stomped into the dressing room.	8.9224905788325
8866. i got a bone to pick with	you mr paxton.	11.548921067020814
8867. andy	rolled up the revised script he had been studying.	7.20412641174243
8868. what about them?	20.3435750720723
8869. 	they're going to louse me up good.	7.14162538120728
8870. my men have been	here all afternoon setting up for this thing.	8.26032117301858
8871. bonner explained	that with the nightclub's cooperation the police had occupied el	dorado like a battlefield.	5.542917982132687
8872. motion picture cameras had been installed	to film the audience the reservation list was being checked out name	by name and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot	scrutinizing automobiles for a possible lead.	6.442479021407267
8873. however it was virtually	impossible to screen the mob outside even if bonner had manpower	available for the purpose.	7.085356437621066
8874. i want you to have the speakers taken	out.	16.166416051461002
8875. seems like we're never going to see	eye to eye lieutenant.	6.210871206873012
8876. didn't they tell you what i wanted the p	a system for?	8.56366187605657
8877.    sure i know.	11.05815118405718
8878. but it's such a	long shot-   no longer than yours.	7.967516649232659
8879. what do you expect	to get tonight anyway?	15.039134948795441
8880.  you think somebody is going to stand up in	the audience and make guilty faces?	12.068813910660458
8881.  or have a sign on his car that	says 'here	comes the paxton kidnapper'?	6.764051514202514
8882.  andy crumbled the	script in his fist.	9.670406878971576
8883. i can't stop you from doing what you think	is right.	5.692555651576243
8884. but don't try to stop me either.	14.311738608160612
8885. someday	bonner said you're going to ask us for help.	6.413534683983516
8886. what you don't understand is that i'm asking	for it now.	9.80125498513243
8887. but bonner departed still full of ill will.	9.374544754266388
8888. he	had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination; he had to	cling to routine tested procedures.	6.607954976384389
8889. to act otherwise would be to admit	his helplessness.	10.013638251641952
8890. but admit or not bonner was helpless.	12.934994931595257
8891. the	crime showed too much planning the kidnappers appeared too proficient	to be caught by a checklist.	5.427950274147271
8892. andy's performance was scheduled	for eleven o'clock.	9.670406878971576
8893. he stalled for a half-hour longer hoping to	hear something from vecchio about the ransom money.	6.512874137333827
8894. bake and shirl	winter on separate telephones could not reach him at any conceivable	location in los angeles nor could they secure any clear-cut information	regarding his efforts.	7.79459187577495
8895. the sweaty bastard's	probably halfway to peru with our money by now.	7.098087065137257
8896. when no one	smiled he felt constrained to add just kidding natch.	9.617190966836258
8897. thornburg popped in to advise andy skolman's sending up	smoke signals.	6.210871206873012
8898. you about ready?	24.616003681853215
8899.    what's he complaining	about?	7.4788191822552905
8900.  bake asked.	29.668223812428412
8901. they're drinking aren't they?	4.428309279409558
8902. 	no.	19.804021762487697
8903. we got a bunch of sippers out there tonight.	10.023158748088395
8904. i guess	nobody wants to pass out and miss anything.	10.853733375513935
8905. thornburg added in a	lower voice but andy overheard they act more like a jury than an	audience.	5.7553919793948625
8906. andy said well i guess we can't wait any	longer.	8.196044167676531
8907. hub you stick by the stage door.	7.14162538120728
8908. if rock shows up during	the number- or you hear anything- give me the signal.	8.82473814658389
8909. shirl winter said i'll stay on the phone mr paxton.	6.6596092639716415
8910. there's	a couple of call-backs i can work on.	7.891419544171187
8911. you're	a sweetheart- but leave one line open.	7.14162538120728
8912. he may try to phone us.	18.084351620780183
8913. andy	passed into the corridor their good lucks! following him.	6.460370037324521
8914. it was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded	different as if he really needed it.	10.518080193243035
8915. the	act cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon	had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone.	5.236383152695367
8916. the result had nothing	of the polish pace or cohesion of the previous night.	10.27390557896002
8917. here's where	luck would normally step in.	5.5589282064975
8918. but this was no ordinary show and andy	knew it.	13.602765943914518
8919. whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it.	9.109301370576317
8920. the audience had come not to be entertained but to judge.	11.680676416161015
8921. twenty-four	hours had changed him from a performer to a freak.	5.780273330606853
8922. within this	framework what followed was strained even macabre.	10.579413745806258
8923. eliminating	the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs	of equal melancholy.	5.427950274147271
8924. the effect was as depressing as a gravestone	the applause irresolute and short-lived.	10.102178510512264
8925. yet andy plowed ahead mouthing	the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning and	gradually his listeners warmed to him.	6.309033862458557
8926. their clapping grew more fervent;	the evening was still not beyond salvaging not as a show but for	him as a person.	7.664670048936355
8927. the worst was yet to come.	9.802060557618772
8928. as andy	reached the finale of his act a subdued commotion backstage drew his	attention to the wings.	8.067806571192346
8929. rocco vecchio- a perspiring haggard vecchio-	was standing there flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored	transport guards.	5.953443468002082
8930. vecchio was nodding and pointing at the	large suitcase he held.	7.879513779734377
8931. andy felt his heart thud heavily with	relief.	7.14162538120728
8932. he waved at fox to cut off the finale introduction.	11.57995453726121
8933. the music	died away discordantly.	12.486750257698887
8934. he drew a deep breath.	15.385132030882776
8935. ladies and gentlemen	in place of my regular closing number tonight i'd like to sing	something of a different nature for you.	5.1556574702728355
8936. ray if you please- the	'cradle song'.	9.670406878971576
8937. he sensed rather than heard the gasp	that swept across the audience.	7.560809233574742
8938. nor could he blame them.	12.946764411202565
8939. this particular	song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate	in bad taste callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency.	5.7721191131877045
8940. having no choice he plunged into it anyway holding onto the microphone	for support.	7.741035895207326
8941. lullaby and goodnight h   his	voice shook.	7.622507342753323
8942. for the first time in his life he forgot the lyrics midway	through and had to cover up by humming the rest.	12.643558743621512
8943. he wondered if the	audience would let him finish.	9.026368296067464
8944. they did; though contemptuous	they were still polite.	11.967541482367666
8945. but when he was finally through their scorn	was made apparent.	12.047896270520091
8946. someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped.	10.004926592870671
8947. otherwise the silence was complete.	10.87754020514496
8948. as the lights came up andy	could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward	the exit.	8.933838268166687
8949. my god he muttered.	10.62070307965623
8950. hub was there to support him.	9.670406878971576
8951. the money's here all of it.	9.802060557618772
8952. at this moment	all he could think of was what he'd been forced to undergo.	10.029808239941252
8953. did	you hear them?	10.363724110347151
8954.  do you know what they think of me?	19.08840036299369
8955. 	bunch of damn jerks hub growled.	7.622507342753323
8956. who needs them?	18.948182413671855
8957. 	thornburg patted his arm.	9.118533821976325
8958. sure andy it'll be all right.	10.119555188347436
8959. nothing broken that can't be mended.	8.835793994220115
8960. thornburg	knew better than any of them that a public image was as fragile	as humpty dumpty.	8.564585900211444
8961. all the king's horses and all the king's	men h   vecchio shouldered in.	8.619863002627959
8962. god knows	how but i got it.	11.98413947442243
8963. you'll never believe the places i've been	today.	3.716069476056229
8964. i practically had to sign your life away you'll probably fire	me for some of the deals i had to go for but-   andy	nodded dully.	9.269605625880176
8965. we've done our part.	5.93390891299491
8966. he clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing	room.	11.414069600459742
8967. the usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent;	the place had the air of a morgue.	6.888594869981437
8968. andy had no desire to linger himself	but hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the	efforts of the police to disperse them.	6.458241936346412
8969. his son watched until he got as far as the hall almost out of	sight then hurried after.	6.856477747123434
8970. he caught	up with the old man in the living room.	15.03727498435517
8971. old man arthur had put down	the suitcase to open the front door.	7.129264827835062
8972. just this one favor	dad.	16.047972100859035
8973. just don't tell ferguson that crazy opinion of yours.	7.9019311498192
8974. why not?	23.24179106238561
8975.  the old man gave the room a stare in leaving; under	the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory.	5.836492208337605
8976. the bartlett girl was killed by	mr dronk's son.	10.582206877639416
8977. rossi and ferguson have been across the street	talking to the kid.	6.002446559592496
8978. they've found some sort of new evidence a bundle	of clothes or something and it must link the kid even stronger	to the crime.	5.912991533115503
8979. why won't you accept facts?	10.769896568464771
8980.  the two kids were together	a lot they were having some kind of teen-age affair- god knows	how far that had gone- and the kid's crippled.	7.486561546346297
8981. he limps and the	man who hit you and took the cane he limped.	6.955990454870539
8982. my god how much	more do you want?	10.123016953672856
8983.    his father looked him over closely.	10.166276656810942
8984. you	sound like an old woman.	10.472119682746735
8985. you should have gone to work today 'stead	of sneaking around spying on the dronk house.	7.974055963484742
8986. now	see here-   the trouble with you old man arthur	began and then checked himself.	7.572158727937999
8987. young mrs arthur had opened the	oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits.	7.280862291115295
8988. the old man opened	the door and stepped out into the sunlight.	12.197856138237206
8989. isn't enough time	to go into it he finished and slammed the door in his son's face.	4.258021306472716
8990. mrs holden turned from the window draperies.	10.359544399544296
8991. they	found something else up there she said half-aloud to the empty room.	5.825820622377272
8992. they took it away overalls or something.	11.967541482367666
8993. she walked restlessly	across the room then back to the windows.	8.653656819198792
8994. now they've gone	they didn't come back and they didn't arrest that dronk boy.	8.227229370419836
8995. she stood frowning and chewing her lip.	9.130734915764195
8996. she was wearing a brown cotton	dress cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her	look slimmer a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleats below.	8.010706654393665
8997. she	smoothed the skirt sat down then stood up and went back to the windows.	6.887749517329304
8998. why on earth did i send him off to work?	11.294789671895472
8999.  there was excuse	enough to keep him home h that young mr arthur's still over	there.	9.002029935930091
9000. with sudden energy she went to the phone and rang	holden's office and asked for him.	10.116284299431634
9001. i think you had better	come home.	18.55063047912894
9002. mr crosson's	been on everybody's neck an order he expected didn't come through	and he's-   i don't care.	7.504617906306989
9003. i'm	all alone and certain things are going on that look very ominous.	5.825820622377272
9004. i	need someone to go out and find out what's happening.	10.915124176779717
9005. but	i couldn't do that even if i were home! his voice grew	high and trembling.	6.120650508000279
9006. i can't be underfoot every time those cops turn	around! they'll h they'll think i did something.	6.357681341915617
9007. he couldn't see the grin that split her mouth; the teeth that	shone into the phone were like a shark's.	5.300898488310679
9008. you'll just have	to risk it.	5.110501839626448
9009. you can't wander along in the dark can you?	7.703848421473251
9010.  i'd	think that you h even more than i h would be wondering what they're	up to.	7.276636412151885
9011. they found some clothes she tossed in.	11.004909320954061
9012. what?	19.804021762487697
9013. 	deliberately she ignored the yelp.	8.254441635698543
9014. also that mr	ferguson was here.	12.15116709216235
9015. i guess he wants to ask you some questions.	10.009508124458607
9016. he doesn't expect you until five.	8.066075435657595
9017. then	i'd better wait until five.	8.254441635698543
9018. no h o h o.	13.484377447423066
9019. she slapped the receiver into its holder and stepped	away.	7.953336273174813
9020. her eyes were bright with anticipation.	11.190090126764806
9021. in his office	mr holden replaced the phone slowly.	10.531389500658427
9022. he rose from his chair.	15.385132030882776
9023. he had to cough then; he went to the window and choked there with	the fresh breeze on his face.	8.67327149634139
9024. he got his hat out of the closet.	15.470254806721336
9025. for	a moment he thought of going into crosson's office to explain that	he had to leave but there was now such a pain in his chest such a	pounding in his head that he decided to let it go.	5.983108885548824
9026. he passed the receptionist	in the outer office muttering i've got to go out for	a little while.	9.284529233778397
9027. let her call crosson if she wanted to let crosson	raise the roof or even can him he didn't care.	5.880984140060634
9028. he got into	the car.	21.29616356004502
9029. putting the key into the switch pressing the accelerator	with his foot putting the car into reverse seemed vast endeavors almost	beyond the ability of his shaking body.	4.8562680427125855
9030. once out in the street	the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken.	10.066601305483246
9031. when he	turned into the highway that led to the outskirts of the city and then	rose toward home he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few	minutes sucking in air and squinting and blinking his eyes to clear	them of tears.	6.354633105549391
9032. what on earth was in mae's mind that she wanted	him up there spying on what the cops were doing?	7.365143963142914
9033.  what did she	think he could do?	10.875763038298551
9034.    he tried to ignore what his own common sense	told him but it wasn't possible; her motives were too blatant.	8.55921287969878
9035. she wanted him to get into trouble.	11.922908476000162
9036. she wanted the police to notice	him suspect him.	10.749202706058774
9037. she was going to keep on scheming poking prodding	suggesting and dictating until the cops got up enough interest in	him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions.	6.0051501236375655
9038. and he knew	in that moment with a cold sinking of despair a dying of old hopes	that mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors.	7.464824081684594
9039. nothing bald open; but enough.	9.726642574313903
9040. they'd have some suspicions to repeat	to the police.	8.581436094141479
9041. though his inner thoughts cringed at it	he forced himself to think back recreating the scene in which mae claimed	to have caught him molesting the child.	5.490483680797886
9042. it hadn't amounted	to anything.	22.5434124636122
9043. there had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions.	11.418345480156415
9044. a second scene flashed before his mind the interior of	the garage at the new house and the young bartlett girl turning startled	to meet him the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then	the brightness as mae had clicked on the light.	6.212700088402957
9045. suppose the	cops somehow got hold of that?	8.412690051217616
9046.    well it hadn't been	what it seemed he'd had no idea the girl was in there.	7.751082728458298
9047. and when he came to examine the scene there was	a certain staginess to it it had the smell of planning and a swift	suspicion darted into his mind.	6.116414289462862
9048. mae	wouldn't have plotted a thing like that.	9.060328853487057
9049. it was just that little	accidents played into her hands.	11.859831723497784
9050. he leaned	on the wheel clutching it staring into the sunlight and tried to bring	order into his thoughts.	8.767689550698904
9051. he felt light-headed and sick.	14.203808386112158
9052. there was	no use wandering off into a territory of utter nightmare.	11.201714275493197
9053. she was married to him for better or for worse.	11.61023454362691
9054. she wouldn't	be wilfully planning his destruction.	12.671390746668923
9055. even as the conviction of truth roared through him shattering	his last hope of safety he was reaching to release the hand brake	to head up the road for home doing her bidding.	5.348381000018987
9056. he drove and the	road wobbled familiar scenes crept past on either side.	9.176540466704445
9057. he came to a	stretch of old orange groves the trees dead some of them uprooted	and then there was an outlying shopping area and tract houses.	7.2310683304730645
9058. he had	the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to	hide.	8.966843711339017
9059. but he couldn't imagine where.	17.228261339645087
9060. there was really no place to	go finally except home to mae.	14.05098706947115
9061. at the gate he slowed looking	around.	16.241821386678758
9062. cooper was beside his car on the curb at the right just	standing there morosely; he didn't even look up.	7.078669562379036
9063. behind him on the	steps of the little office sat old man arthur; he was straight	something angry in his attitude as if he might be waiting to report	something.	5.973077158528461
9064. holden stepped on the gas.	11.672450974675096
9065. a new idea drifted in from	nowhere.	10.866467006113202
9066. he could go to the police.	20.187502179124483
9067. he could tell them his fears	of being involved he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood	and how mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him-	the scene was complete in his mind at the moment even to his	own jerkings	and snivelings and ferguson's silent patience.	6.45607230668096
9068. he could throw	himself on the mercy of the police department.	13.756290984773917
9069. it wasn't	what mae would want him to do though.	13.37961157846634
9070. he was sure of this.	19.87986593677342
9071. once	he had abandoned himself to the very worst once he had quieted all	the dragons of worry and suspense there wouldn't be very much for	mae to do.	5.0388923695229
9072. at that moment holden almost slammed on the brakes to go	back to cooper and ask if ferguson was about.	8.68720314112158
9073. it would be	such a relief.	22.281983037867086
9074. what was that old sign supposed to be painted	over a door somewhere abandon hope all ye who enter here?	9.02988686759014
9075. 	why holden said to himself surprised at his own sudden insight	i'll bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can	be.	4.962523894448977
9076. they've worried they've lain awake nights they've shook	at the slightest footstep they've pictured their own destruction and	now it's all over and they can give up.	5.80921119615629
9077. sure they're giving up	hope.	9.65096761438776
9078. hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension.	10.075120092422562
9079. holden waved a hand at the empty street.	7.311183470306193
9080. glad to	see you go.	11.568363037656766
9081. he drove into the paved space before the garage	and got out slamming the car door.	6.824788097151444
9082. he looked up and down the street.	18.34974902006259
9083. if ferguson's car had been in sight holden would have walked	directly to it.	8.17948881568496
9084. he went to the front door and opened it and looked	in.	14.619476329372231
9085. mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen.	6.210871206873012
9086. she had a cup of something steaming coffee perhaps in one hand a	fresh piece of toast in the other.	8.834071347662546
9087. she stood there watching holden	come in and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner	with a huge chomp of her white teeth.	5.203498306446581
9088. mae-	i've been thinking she said swallowing the toast.	8.581436094141479
9089. didn't	you have an old pair of painting overalls in the garage?	6.002446559592496
9090.  you	used them that time you painted the porch at our other house.	7.391013650626644
9091. and then	you wiped up some grease.	10.242612813271945
9092. she had caught him off guard	no preparation nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster.	9.047392034526428
9093. what do you-   i've been	looking for them and they're gone.	10.144885586464854
9094. i'm sure they were in the garage	up until a couple of days ago.	8.172705202842112
9095. you used to paint	in them and then you just took them for rags.	7.346120290659929
9096. the police have them	now.	17.270822623399575
9097. i don't remember any overalls at all.	5.321167624718023
9098. worn through at the knees.	10.472119682746735
9099. she stood sipping	and chewing and watching.	9.987973641461945
9100. green paint wasn't it?	12.017154813173825
9101.  well	i'm not sure of the color.	7.622507342753323
9102. mae	sit down.	15.594944937291627
9103. put down the cup of coffee.	9.455064269046728
9104. tell me what this is all about.	10.224293196085107
9105. she took another bite of toast.	11.442449083444732
9106. holden	noticed almost absently how she chewed how the whole side of her	cheek moved a slab of fat that extended down into her neck.	6.157942065974489
9107. my goodness	you ought to remember if i do.	7.487989836845301
9108. you're going to have to go	to the police and explain what happened.	8.659135808404935
9109. tell them the truth h or	something h before they come here.	6.165403007181228
9110. a seeping coldness entered	holden's being; his nerves seemed frost-bitten down to the tips	of his tingling fingers and his spine felt stiff and glass-like liable	to break like an icicle at any moment.	6.495225760426596
9111. i've never owned any	painting overalls.	4.830320705807231
9112. a man with a sketch pad in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small	office at the end of a long dim corridor and made pencil lines on paper	and said is this more like it mrs macready?	8.967018420965061
9113.  or are	the eyebrows more like this?	9.152997992516964
9114.  when he had finished with that he	would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to	someone else most probably a busboy.	9.465242368600151
9115. begin to look like him now	would you say?	8.875968883205255
9116.  different about the mouth huh?	11.92666390099271
9117.  more like this	maybe?	15.637926531738279
9118.    men blew dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth	floor of the hotel dumont and blew it off again and did the same	in a tiny almost airless room in a tenement in the west forties.	6.491357590012182
9119. and men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms sucking dust up once	more.	6.7513421309202295
9120. men from the third detective district eighteenth precinct	had the longest the most tedious job.	8.62465194759735
9121. at the hotel dumont	there had at the time in issue been twenty-three overnighters counting	couples as singular.	10.580227915951044
9122. these included as one mr and mrs	anthony payne who had checked in a little after noon the day before	and had not checked out together.	6.959484417164457
9123. but gardner willings was not	included; he had been at the dumont for almost a week.	7.927374686236315
9124. there was	of course no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought	had stayed only overnight at the hotel.	13.35092060658121
9125. the twenty-three	provided merely a place to	start and their identification was the barest of starts.	6.374057384651866
9126. with names	and addresses listed verification came next.	11.993036733268653
9127. it would take time;	it would almost inevitably trouble some water.	13.1513244544085
9128. not at the dumont last night and my husband couldn't have been.	11.032113784473422
9129. he's	the hotel king	arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems.	6.320429262843674
9130. the king arthur offered respectable and convenient lodgings to people	from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and didn't want- heaven	knew didn't want!- to lunge anxiously through crowded streets	to railroad stations and at odd hours of night drive from smaller stations	to distant homes probably through rain or in november something	worse.	6.008689370828702
9131. the king arthur was less expensive than the dumont.	9.157391225922586
9132. the	king arthur had fifty-four overnighters again counting rooms rather	than people.	7.879513779734377
9133. failing to find	what was wanted as was most likely check out other guests with special-	but not exclusive- attention to those with rooms on the street.	5.16030075376435
9134. and	know while all this went on that there was no real reason to suppose	that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel.	7.5289499614943205
9135. it was not even	certain the shot had been fired from either hotel.	10.993436864205002
9136. there were other	roofs less convenient but not impossible.	16.180205155695525
9137. it is dull business detecting	and hard on feet.	13.987125813235107
9138. there was also the one salient question	to ask and ask widely: did you notice anything out of the way?	11.582491475105154
9139. 	like for example a man carrying a twenty-two rifle probably with	a telescopic sight attached?	6.040969625507404
9140.    there was of course no hope	it really would be that simple.	15.895244559495254
9141. the sniper whether psychopathic marksman	or murderer by intent would hardly have walked to his vantage point	with rifle over shoulder whistling a marching tune.	5.327707589329553
9142. anybody carrying	anything that might hide a rifle?	9.393880003184625
9143.  long thin suitcase?	14.87909153769608
9144.  or long	fat suitcase for that matter?	11.612086518250209
9145.  shrugs met that from room clerks	from bellhops.	7.14162538120728
9146. who measures?	23.885782126812085
9147.  but nothing it appeared long enough	to attract attention.	9.374544754266388
9148. cases say for musical instruments?	10.472119682746735
9149.  none	noted at the dumont.	9.118533821976325
9150. several at the king arthur.	12.214756538438678
9151. a combo was staying	there.	11.781091587713144
9152. and had been for a week.	15.37627068351485
9153. anything else?	12.292407525564322
9154.  anything at	all?	15.594944937291627
9155.  shrugs met that.	10.363724110347151
9156. thought for a time he might be on to something.	9.934243893871614
9157. a refuse bin at	the dumont turned up a florist's box- a very long box for very	long-stemmed flowers.	6.303617961334385
9158. traces of oil on green tissue?	9.670406878971576
9159.  the lab to check.	12.486750257698887
9160. anything at all strange?	13.331181950562211
9161. 	well a man had tried at the king arthur to register with	an ocelot.	5.674295354649883
9162. at the dumont a guest had come in a collapsible wheel chair.	11.53798685886355
9163. at the king arthur one guest had had his head heavily bandaged	and another had a bandaged foot and had walked with crutches.	6.219099189121283
9164. there	had also been a man who must have had st vitus or something because	he kept jerking his head.	7.795348196279772
9165. as reports dribbled in william	weigand tossed them into the centrifuge which had become his head.	6.854642173743764
9166. there was no sign of mrs lauren payne at her	house on nod road ridgefield connecticut.	11.786541324756065
9167. the house was modern	large on five acres.	11.760594373764414
9168. the state cops would	check from time to time; pass word when there was word to pass.	10.737985325871591
9169. weigand	tossed this news into the centrifuge.	7.622507342753323
9170. sort things out damn it.	10.472119682746735
9171. sort out the next move.	8.254441635698543
9172. try to forget motive for the moment.	11.972603423100864
9173. only those actually with payne when he was shot	or who had left the party within not more than five minutes	positively had none.	7.0056877346508335
9174. the norths; hathaway jerry's	publicity director; livingston birdwood producer of uprising.	9.430036403335416
9175. they had been with payne when he was shot could not therefore	have shot him from above.	8.276532795102566
9176. he had	left after the scuffle; had been seen to leave.	10.090191208524187
9177. he would have had ample	time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey.	9.888493806928626
9178. consider him	seriously therefore?	17.511315663104252
9179.  intangibles entered then- hunches which	felt like facts.	7.14162538120728
9180. willings would ambush certainly; willings undoubtedly	had.	9.670406878971576
9181. willings was presumably a better than average shot.	8.522291966361538
9182. but-	hunch now- willings would not ambush anything which went on two	legs instead of four.	7.032105024464237
9183. because if for no other reason willings would	never for a moment suppose he was not bigger tougher than anything	else that went on two legs.	6.537720889324788
9184. ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves	as any man may against a tiger.	7.8554666806602516
9185. faith constable had	had to go on from the party and had presumably gone on.	6.6676074548278
9186. to	be checked out further.	11.568363037656766
9187. forget motive?	12.292407525564322
9188.  no motive is a part of fact.	17.614498245802817
9189. nobody in his right mind punishes a quarter-century-old dereliction.	7.4332941442357985
9190. grudges simply do not keep that well in a sane mind.	8.070513494709639
9191. faith constable	had accomplished much in a quarter of a century.	8.078574280567125
9192. jeopardize it now	to correct so old a wrong?	8.581436094141479
9193.  bill shook his head.	10.55879507725614
9194. also he thought	i doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun.	9.195988857493209
9195. lauren herself?	12.292407525564322
9196.  she had left the party early pleading a headache.	12.513198451296681
9197. no lack of opportunity presuming she had a gun.	8.171392663509755
9198. she might conceivably	have brought one in in a large-enough suitcase.	9.557448030765887
9199. she might now have taken it away again.	8.472846859613272
9200. motive- her	husband wandering?	13.148092146312546
9201.  bitter unreasoning jealousy?	10.363724110347151
9202.  heaven knew	it happened and hell knew it too.	8.878572708331582
9203. but- it happened almost always	among the primitive and usually among the very young.	5.674295354649883
9204. there was nothing to indicate that lauren	payne was primitive.	20.09350874190919
9205. she did not move in primitive circles.	9.880119467020569
9206. she	was young but not that young.	9.818077947137997
9207. it occurred to bill weigand	that he was on a hunch basis eliminating a good many.	8.594254801221213
9208. he reminded	himself that all eliminations were tentative.	12.411802052220429
9209. he also reminded himself	that he had an unusual number of possibilities.	8.82748779140268
9210. the masons	mother or son or mother and son?	10.582206877639416
9211.  opportunity was obvious.	10.363724110347151
9212. here too the cause to hate lay well back in the years.	12.97322255076579
9213. but	bitterness had more cause to remain even increasingly to corrode.	6.210871206873012
9214. the boy had apparently- if mrs macready	was right in what she had told mullins- only in recent months	been forced to give up college to work as a busboy.	7.24012380952089
9215. seeing the man	he blamed for this made much of- youth and bitterness and-	bill picked up the telephone; got mullins.	5.552486655435191
9216. send out a	pickup on mrs mason and the boy when you've got enough to go on	bill said.	6.739657665891012
9217. a	man named lars simon playwright-director had expressed a wish that	anthony payne drop dead.	5.725106139771221
9218. he would say of course that he had not	really had any such wish; that what he had said was no more than one	of those things one does say lightly meaning nothing.	9.289270790143886
9219. which probably	would turn out to be true; which he obviously had to be given the	opportunity to say.	8.734386711816756
9220. a man named blaine smythe with y	and e but pronounced without them had been fired at payne's	insistence.	8.32143358445726
9221. he was also if pam north was right a closer acquaintance	of lauren payne's than she now was inclined to admit.	6.894314262672479
9222. he might deny the latter; would certainly deny any connection between	the two things or any connection of either with murder.	8.097988165046116
9223. he would	have to be given the opportunity.	13.645825061459687
9224. mullins?	19.804021762487697
9225.  it was evident	that mullins was the man to go.	12.746406809975174
9226. it was evident that a captain should	remain at his desk directing with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat.	8.846085847244218
9227. bill weigand was good and tired of the wall opposite and the crack	in the plaster.	5.773676251767952
9228. let mullins keep the firm seat; let stein.	11.347564016416058
9229. when siamese cats are intertwined it is difficult to tell where	one leaves off and another begins.	7.424017314209204
9230. stilts and shadow on pam's	bed appeared to be one cat- rather large as siamese cats go and	to be sure having two heads and two tails.	7.118575574267444
9231. on the other hand they	or it seemed to have no legs whatever.	15.50279951215315
9232. pamela north said hi	to her cats and added that proper cats met their humans at the door.	6.643215071337043
9233. of four dark brown ears one twitched slightly at this.	8.047874301220256
9234. i know it isn't dinnertime.	19.53967019564306
9235. but at	this the one too-large cat suddenly became two cats stretching.	7.793238909001978
9236. shadow	the more talkative began at once to talk her voice piteous.	8.10606122814411
9237. stilts	a more direct cat leaped from the bed and trotted briskly toward	the kitchen.	5.674295354649883
9238. shadow looked surprised wailed and trotted after her.	8.581436094141479
9239. the hell it isn't dinnertime two waving tails told pam north.	7.098087065137257
9240. it was not whatever tale was told by tails.	18.517033352921885
9241. she might be firm.	12.783489925651207
9242. it was most unlikely that she would	be firm.	17.521830876211435
9243. they want to be fat cats pam thought and lighted a cigarette	and leaned back on a chaise and considered pulling her thoughts together.	6.609409509786664
9244. after a time it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth	the trouble.	9.94439056364092
9245. a vague feeling that anthony payne had had it coming	was hardly a thought and was in any event reprehensible.	6.772852687210647
9246. had faith	constable's explanation of her confidence so uninvited been a	little thin?	8.767315445513463
9247.  that was more like a thought but not a great deal more.	12.080693114237604
9248. had that tall dark boy carrying trays too heavy for him found what	he might have considered adulation of a man he probably hated more	than he could bear?	7.183889689340993
9249.  and possessed himself- how?	13.192167111495898
9250. - of a rifle	and killed?	6.1856295509655945
9251.  pam found she had no answers; had only a hope.	6.210871206873012
9252. the poor	kid- the poor frail kid.	12.435529358277208
9253. some people have luck and some have no	luck and that whatever people who prefer order say is the size of	it.	6.07743401174962
9254. the poor unlucky-   the telephone rang.	13.092899401402555
9255. pam realized to	her surprise that she had been almost dozing.	8.009698108871172
9256. at four o'clock in	the afternoon.	18.49693821297719
9257. two martinis for lunch- that was the trouble.	9.106462250985322
9258. you do remember.	24.616003681853215
9259. you just- hello?	19.40307901854524
9260. 	yes this is she?	11.568363037656766
9261.  what?	15.610129252044759
9262.    the voice had music	in it.	15.944157331596246
9263. even with words coming too fast they came on the music of the	voice.	8.577309147941273
9264. i said i would pam said.	18.064791514414765
9265. they won't talk	about who gave the information.	10.191364125816797
9266. not unless they have to.	14.174471042466617
9267. not unless they have-   she was	interrupted.	10.009742122044596
9268. call this a cry for help faith constable	said.	8.581436094141479
9269. through a door conveniently unlocked madden supplemented.	8.622231694406029
9270. that damn door said the police chief.	12.064727433049098
9271. a gift horse	to be viewed with suspicion.	8.604265568338976
9272. madden's dark face wore a meditative	look.	9.670406878971576
9273. if there was collusion between an outside murderer and	a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check	on the door later.	7.811758236499097
9274. and it makes a very poor red herring for an inside	job.	11.695756951840433
9275. much better to break a cellar window.	9.256259693809463
9276. don't	forget there was the hope it would pass for a natural death pauling	reminded him.	7.391716510830432
9277. well with a house as big as that there	must be at least one cellar window that wouldn't be noticed right away	unless there was a police investigation.	6.20904498076945
9278. and a	pane of glass isn't hard to-   the telephone interrupted	him.	9.73086604464448
9279. he scooped up the receiver and said police chief into	the mouthpiece and then oh yes mr benson.	6.174920939052518
9280. i was hoping i'd	hear from you today.	14.894590857967684
9281. with his free hand he pulled a pad	and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened saying	uh-huh and i see at intervals.	5.670116886062523
9282. at last he said	well thank you for calling mr benson.	14.120433088974826
9283. although there was	no doubt in my mind and we've been handling it as one i'm glad	to have it made official.	6.110319085923541
9284. coroner he said	to madden.	11.568363037656766
9285. he's just heard from the pathologist who says mrs	meeker apparently died from suffocation.	4.163744250580886
9286. pauling looked at his	notes.	13.757179633315918
9287. many minute hemorrhages in the lungs; particles of lint	and thread in the mouth and nostrils.	6.409190358631709
9288. scrapings from the bed linen	identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral cavities.	7.368125845775065
9289. no other cause of death apparent.	14.03196380657379
9290. trachea clear of mucus and foreign	objects.	9.670406878971576
9291. brain examined for thrombosis clot or hemorrhage.	7.14162538120728
9292. no signs	of these no gross hemorrhage of lungs heart brain or stomach.	8.520487136832335
9293. oh the time of death.	15.24898568993521
9294. the duration	of the digestive process varies the pathologist says but the empty	stomach and the findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate	that mrs meeker died several hours after her seven-o'clock	dinner.	6.419627980767581
9295. probably around midnight give or take an hour either way.	7.085189134227578
9296. so there it is he said.	14.997939904401758
9297. not	your problem of course unless johnston and the murderer are one	and the same.	5.674295354649883
9298. however likely	it was pauling said he couldn't limit himself to it.	8.964602128030208
9299. he had	to look for other prospects other motives until more conclusive evidence	pointing to johnston came to light.	6.174920939052518
9300. madden with his investigation	centered on the fraud said that tomorrow he would go to the bronx	bank through which mrs meeker's checks to johnston had cleared.	6.491007157431429
9301. arthur williams had to be located they agreed.	8.57227481055194
9302. he might	have been in collusion with johnston on the fraud; he might be mrs	meeker's murderer or have played some part in her death.	7.209454105266114
9303. this	was madden's suggestion; the police chief shook his head over it.	6.650487077119469
9304. if arthur williams was involved in the fraud or the murder then he	too had another identity.	9.24214787566525
9305. no one the medfield police had questioned	professed to know any more about him than about johnston.	6.613963300247831
9306. scholarship	applicant?	19.804021762487697
9307.  pauling looked doubtful.	12.633521198921308
9308. madden explained that	he was thinking of an application sent directly to mrs meeker.	7.198778874655976
9309. then he asked to use the phone and called brian thayer who said that	he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two	o'clock.	5.785662603415218
9310. madden said that he would see him at two and made another	call this one to mrs meeker's lawyers.	8.169875293179732
9311. mr hohlbein	was out for the day but mr garth would be free at one-thirty.	7.308267144732535
9312. the	secretary's tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice	was a concession for which madden should be duly grateful.	6.44893033609597
9313. he inferred that hohlbein and garth were high-priced lawyers.	8.431773034471274
9314. he had lunch with pauling.	19.830059105532623
9315. promptly at one-thirty he entered hohlbein	and garth's elegant suite of offices in medfield's newest	professional building.	5.766054785357401
9316. he disliked garth on sight conservative	clothes and haircut smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man	who must be well into his thirties handclasp too consciously quick and	firm.	6.582752729917001
9317. youngish man on the make madden labeled him and was ready	to guess that in a correct not too pushing fashion the junior partner	of the firm had political ambitions; that mrs garth would be	impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer; that there	were three children two boys and a girl; that she was active in the	woman's club and he in lions rotary and jaycee; and finally	that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their	wedding day.	4.563488926618623
9318. madden knew that he could be completely wrong about	all this but also knew that he would go right on disliking garth.	7.923688062426911
9319. garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with	fastidious distaste as this unfortunate johnston affair which would	not he said more than once have ever come about if mrs meeker	had only seen fit to consult mr hohlbein or him about it.	5.013187273689789
9320. madden regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement.	9.316665878105635
9321. he asked to see a copy of mrs meeker's will.	10.847230527368236
9322. the date october 8 1957 immediately caught	the inspector's eye.	9.945332631078985
9323. was she	in the habit of making new wills?	8.601049231145641
9324.    oh no.	20.075671720619166
9325. she had reason	to change the one she made right after mr meeker's death.	7.459553825754247
9326. her	estate had grown considerably.	11.568363037656766
9327. she wanted to make a more equitable	distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most; particularly	the scholarship fund.	6.679959107771798
9328. at the time the will was drawn mr	hohlbein mentioned to me how mentally alert she seemed for her age	knowing just what changes she wanted made and so forth.	8.491080117241538
9329. mr hohlbein and i have noticed some lapses since	though.	9.022237212463981
9330. most of them this past year i'd say.	17.848245184530036
9331. even two or three	years ago i doubt that she'd have become involved in this unfortunate	johnston affair.	6.89509557392354
9332. she'd have consulted us you see.	9.670406878971576
9333. she always	did before and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised.	6.897938509958291
9334. the inspector nodded doubting this.	13.848082117783294
9335. mrs meeker hadn't	struck him as ready to seek anyone's advise least of all garth's.	6.015934503391766
9336. with her sharp tongue she'd have cut his pompousness to ribbons.	9.353719599580794
9337. it would have been hohlbein who handled her affairs.	17.10803924101076
9338. madden	settled back to read the will.	11.589430902607539
9339. he skimmed over the millions	that went to meeker park medfield hospital the civic center	the public health nursing association the library and so on pausing	when he came to the scholarship fund.	0.0
9340. two millions were added to	what had been set aside for it in mrs meeker's lifetime and	the proviso made that as long as brian thayer continued to discharge	his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board	of trustees	he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary commensurate	with the increased responsibilities enlargement of the fund would	entail.	6.562075113255021
9341. a splendid vote of confidence in thayer madden	reflected.	8.023923068000494
9342. he went on to personal	bequests a list of names largely unknown to him.	13.806415508454466
9343. twenty-five thousand	to each of the great-nieces in oregon	ten thousand to this friend and that five thousand	to another; to brian thayer the sum of ten thousand dollars;	to the pecks ten thousand each; to joan sheldon the conditional	bequest of ten thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was	still in mrs meeker's employ at the time of the latter's death.	5.103949731102867
9344. birthday; mrs meeker hadn't got around to taking care	too bad madden thought.	7.391013650626644
9345. joan sheldon had earned	the larger bequest.	8.309587635189425
9346. mr hohlbein was left twenty thousand	garth ten.	10.963282851070431
9347. there were no other names madden recognized.	16.089861249458878
9348. arthur williams's	might well have been included he felt.	8.758472976633017
9349. mrs meeker had	spent a small fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for	him in her will if he should be found after her death and had never	mentioned his name to her lawyers.	4.717016874744818
9350. madden took up this point	with garth who shrugged it off.	7.879513779734377
9351. old people have their idiosyncrasies.	9.51303048330792
9352. this one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more.	9.892234820000406
9353. well she had a number of them where money was concerned	garth said.	8.495678415907088
9354. sometimes we'd have trouble persuading her to	make tax-exempt charitable contributions and i've known her to quarrel	with a plumber over a bill for fixing a faucet; the next moment	she'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty	thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate johnston	affair.	5.617423467216343
9355. there was no telling how she'd react to spending money.	13.311782949429915
9356. madden inquired next about the audit of the scholarship fund.	7.879513779734377
9357. there was an annual audit garth informed him.	15.612420722256681
9358. no discrepancies	or shortages had ever been found.	11.801499478514648
9359. brian thayer was a thoroughly	honest and competent administrator.	6.764147616291221
9360. his salary had reached the ten thousand	mark.	10.276228481933904
9361. his expenses ran another four or five thousand.	8.557015479436208
9362. the lawyer	didn't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some	dinner party- thayer like himself madden reflected was the extra	man so prized by hostesses- and found him easy enough to talk to.	6.0925823706864595
9363. but he didn't play golf didn't seem to belong to any local clubs-	his work took him away a lot of course- which probably accounted	for his tendency to keep to himself.	6.543633122674813
9364. garth's glance began	to flicker to his watch.	9.060328853487057
9365. he said that he had already told the	police chief that he didn't know what insurance man had recommended	johnston to mrs meeker.	7.066372495193681
9366. he would offer no theory to account	for her murder.	12.695092995522733
9367. the whole thing his manner conveyed was so far outside	the normal routine of hohlbein and garth that it practically demanded	being swept under the rug.	5.583840394698593
9368. no doubt mrs meeker had	snubbed him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing.	8.977778966786344
9369. even so	madden's dislike of the suave correct lawyer deepened.	8.06896123575588
9370. it would	be all right with him he decided if his investigation of the fraud	with its probable by-product of murder led to garth's door.	8.18026603504326
9371. at first glance not much of a motive	for a man of his standing; but for all his air of affluence who	could tell what his private financial picture was?	6.7799879382234245
9372.    the inspector	knew as he left that this was wishful thinking.	11.672118752015344
9373. nevertheless	he made a mental note to look into garth's financial background.	6.714801540574991
9374. brian thayer had a downtown address.	9.670406878971576
9375. he lived in an apartment	house not over three or four years old a reclaimed island of landscaped	brick and glass on the fringe of the business district.	7.2574958844318544
9376. he	occupied a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor using the second	bedroom as his office.	7.032105024464237
9377. airy and bright the apartment was furnished	with good modern furniture rugs and draperies.	5.674295354649883
9378. done by a professional	decorator madden thought and somehow as impersonal as unremarkable	as its occupant.	7.032105024464237
9379. in dunston the rent would run close to two hundred	a month; in medfield perhaps twenty-five less not all of it	paid by thayer who could charge off one room on his expense account.	5.558935734532947
9380. he took madden into the room he used as an office.	11.053812967913414
9381. it contained	a desk files a typewriter on a stand and two big leather armchairs.	7.456160179316808
9382. a newspaper open at stock-market reports lay on one of them.	9.484079466754219
9383. thayer	folded it up and offered a drink.	7.740826906014617
9384. to begin the interview he asked if thayer with more time to think	it over could add to what he had said the other day about johnston.	8.401192133887427
9385. it's all i think about too.	2.690759358905576
9386. it's still unbelievable that it was murder.	4.686300985702388
9387. for	all her domineering ways i can't conceive of her having had a deadly	enemy.	5.7810420801678895
9388. dammit phil are you trying to wreck my career?	8.5841764800845
9389.  because	that's what you're doing- wrecking it wrecking it wrecking it!	griffith had confronted hoag on the building's front steps-	hoag had been permitted no further- and backed him against a wrought-iron	railing.	4.625142923266387
9390. his rage had built up as he made his way here from	the second floor helped by the quantity of champagne he had consumed.	7.975057883424432
9391. hoag said i didn't send for you leigh.	4.872351232078798
9392. i want the	captain in charge.	17.76915433389997
9393. where is he?	14.174771857579415
9394.    phil for god's sake	go away.	10.472119682746735
9395. i told you there's	nothing between midge and me nothing.	10.75953570034339
9396. it's all in your mind.	3.2927943356586518
9397. a	couple of sobs escaped him followed by a sentiment that revealed his	emotional state.	6.247659742340451
9398. why i'm not fit to touch the hem of her garment.	8.932838799082655
9399. leigh get a grip on yourself.	7.622507342753323
9400. it's not about you	or midge.	3.2854110023773564
9401. i have some security information about the prime minister.	12.158104897697392
9402. griffith looked at him suspiciously through red-rimmed	eyes.	9.060328853487057
9403. not about me?	15.295075013501911
9404.  you mean it phil?	20.025453829488345
9405.  you wouldn't pull	my leg old man?	11.823504411807077
9406.  i did get you on the platform this morning.	10.853733375513935
9407. i'm not pulling your leg.	3.699222138671167
9408. will you call that captain?	14.426380302955707
9409. 	no use he won't come.	8.254441635698543
9410. he peered closely at hoag	in the gathering darkness.	11.45143587764551
9411. what happened to your head?	16.170419359535178
9412. 	i was hit- knocked out.	10.472119682746735
9413. now will you get him?	10.622662447258575
9414.    he	says i'm to take the message.	11.49703622891372
9415. he stared at hoag drunkenly.	12.127026643485452
9416. who'd hit you in the head?	10.699912332610028
9417.    it doesn't matter.	13.434345552963515
9418. you get back to the captain and tell him this: somebody's going	to take a shot at the prime minister and mahzeer is in on the plot.	8.901730060518291
9419. tell him under no circumstances to trust the prime minister with mahzeer.	7.080688105965021
9420. mahzeer's	the ambassador.	15.594944937291627
9421. griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne	fuzz that encased it.	6.473709645204878
9422. i'll show you how wrong you are.	5.994717221457542
9423. mahzeer	and the prime minister are alone right now.	7.592498988449206
9424. so that proves it!   hoag looked terrified.	12.554642036077182
9425. where	are they?	12.60684743790722
9426.    where'd you expect the john?	10.472119682746735
9427.  mahzeer's	office.	15.610129252044759
9428. where is that?	17.983034337081474
9429.    facing us	two flights up.	9.596210979619054
9430. look old man you can't go up.	12.72504492967193
9431. they won't even	let you in the front door.	9.497629028263638
9432. so why don't you be a good boy and-	hoag grabbed him by the shoulders.	9.768645645068922
9433. if you want to spend another day in the state department- another	day- you get in there and tell that captain what i told you.	8.124261035163126
9434. he bit out the words.	15.385132030882776
9435. and you know i can do it.	13.84443137665413
9436. easy does it phil.	12.242792916458907
9437. i'm on my way.	4.113546812337769
9438. he turned and fled into the house and made	his way up the marble stairs without once looking back.	9.176745145465267
9439. on the second	landing he paused to look for docherty didn't see him and accepted	a glass of champagne.	7.882397645819055
9440. he took several large swallows recollected	that docherty had gone up another flight and decided he would be wise	to cover himself by finding him.	8.214622767994227
9441. the way hoag was no telling what	he might say or do.	8.59490414741109
9442. he finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly	to the next landing.	11.652942151369658
9443. at the top a uniformed officer blocked further	progress.	13.731976253742163
9444. yes what is it?	14.895633550238912
9445.  he asked.	21.889553134177078
9446. he spotted docherty coming out of a room at the far	end of the corridor and called to him.	8.651336741618248
9447. docherty said it's	okay bonfiglio let him by.	7.14162538120728
9448. they walked toward each other.	14.714773213271867
9449. well?	15.610129252044759
9450.    griffith said hoag told me to tell you-	he waited until they were close; it was hideously embarrassing-	not to let the prime minister be alone with mahzeer.	6.6530588659456775
9451. griffith	looked half-crocked to the captain; it would be just like him.	6.803151947791753
9452. why not?	23.24179106238561
9453.    he claims mahzeer's in a plot to kill	the pm.	8.431773034471274
9454. docherty went taut: was it possible?	9.670406878971576
9455. 	could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister	feared?	6.056488500469207
9456.  not possible he thought; the prime minister knew who	his enemy was here; he wasn't going to allow himself to be led meekly	to the slaughter.	7.310562810427102
9457. and if by some wild chance mahzeer was the man	he wouldn't dare try anything now- not after docherty had looked	in on the two of them to see that all was well.	6.830727567732846
9458. docherty was damned	if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over	the laundry truck.	6.907450414312023
9459. one more muddleheaded play like that one and they'd	be leading him away.	7.165084184249607
9460. still this had to be checked out.	14.807120140710179
9461. where'd	your friend hoag get his information?	7.622507342753323
9462.  he asked.	27.770505909397876
9463. would you mind	sending him up here?	12.830047857123914
9464.  i'd like to talk to him.	8.792226327121
9465. troubled he continued	along the corridor poking his head into the next office for	a careful look around.	5.326519577128725
9466. but hoag had not stayed on the front	steps when griffith disappeared into the building.	9.228699091116056
9467. he was unwilling	to rely on griffith's carrying his message and he had no confidence	the police would act on it.	7.5946844841106405
9468. if mahzeer was alone with the prime minister	he could be arranging his execution while hoag stood out here	shivering in the darkening street.	7.392407394171671
9469. he would have to do something on his	own.	24.115479891019483
9470. but what?	29.954223479466464
9471.    the door opened and three men and a woman	in a sari swept past him and down the stairs.	7.391480455403589
9472. in the lighted interior	he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps.	12.1392359179099
9473. these were	the early departures; in half an hour the reception would be over.	7.393816280820123
9474. if	mahzeer was planning to set up the prime minister for muller he would	have to do it in the next few minutes.	0.0
9475. hoag descended the stone	steps to the street and looked up at the building.	6.417048588227443
9476. wide windows with	many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories.	7.615092762846159
9477. on the second	floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests; the scene looked	like a christmas card.	8.786836652303633
9478. on the third floor one of the two windows	was lighted; it was framed in maroon drapes and no faces were visible.	10.604191598636165
9479. this would be mahzeer's office.	18.35045750049644
9480. he and the prime minister would	be back from the window seated at mahzeer's desk; they would	be going over papers mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting.	8.211124376106362
9481. in a minute or five minutes the business would be done; mahzeer	would stand up the prime minister would follow.	6.953094130407581
9482. mahzeer would direct	the prime minister's attention to something out the window and	would guide him forward and then step to one side.	6.290129093830134
9483. the single shot would	come; hoag would carry its sound to his grave.	7.950779798968883
9484. mahzeer of course	would be desolate.	10.472119682746735
9485. how was he to suspect that an assassin had been	lurking somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance?	6.800434638826115
9486. 	hoag turned.	15.594944937291627
9487. where across the street?	11.992927780254675
9488.  where was muller	waiting with the rifle?	14.180770527053488
9489.  narrow four-story buildings ran the length	of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf.	5.56874018813484
9490. most of them could	be eliminated; muller's would have to be one of the half dozen	almost directly opposite.	18.323739242119032
9491. the legation was generously set back from	the building line; if the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings	on either side would interfere.	5.4282734535383454
9492. would the shot come from a roof?	14.316751096402603
9493. 	he ran his eye along the roof copings; almost at once a figure	bulked up.	6.730642805070004
9494. but dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and	badge of a policeman.	8.741314683746015
9495. with a cop patrolling the road muller would	have to be inside a building- if he was here at all and not waiting	for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal	building at la guardia airport.	5.650612490176673
9496. hoag crossed the narrow street	squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk.	8.235068666213383
9497. from this	side he could see farther into the legation's third-story window but	he saw no faces; the room's occupants were still seated or they	had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain.	4.993842357035171
9498. if only	the latter were true h.	14.553063018573363
9499. he walked rapidly along the buildings scanning	their facades: one was a club- that was out; two others he	ruled out because all their windows were lighted.	5.667698505292368
9500. that left three possibly	four one looking much like the next.	11.534517059210005
9501. he climbed the steps of	the first and opened the door to the vestibule.	7.93639865910942
9502. he quickly closed it	again.	17.83289566254582
9503. he had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into	apartments but this one from a glance at the hall furnishings was	obviously still a functioning town house and its owners were in residence;	that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans	had to be made in advance.	5.920814850622213
9504. he went on to the next building and	found what he expected- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule.	11.453197264580682
9505. on one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes; there	were six apartments.	8.089137664553816
9506. now what?	22.766819579048363
9507.  the names on the mailboxes meant	nothing to him.	8.341215694113531
9508. this was senseless- he had no idea what to look for.	11.72501503564456
9509. he peered in the boxes themselves; all were empty except one and	that one was jammed with letters and magazines.	5.909009505545415
9510. the occupants of apartment	number 3 were probably away for a few days and not likely to	return on a friday.	8.876734178258184
9511. had muller made the same deduction?	10.212421362573018
9512.  muller	was attracted to the lore of mailboxes.	9.060328853487057
9513. he opened the inner door;	the cooking	odors were stronger- all over the city at this hour housewives	would be fussing over stoves.	6.684858639525011
9514. he climbed as quickly as he could urge	his body up the two unbroken flights to the third floor pulling	himself along on a delicate balustrade all that remained of the building's	beauty.	7.0322775754555185
9515. he paused on the landing to steady his breathing and	then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb	overhead.	6.936188152771157
9516. now he was certain: the lock had not yielded to muller's	collection of keys; fresh scars showed that the door had been	prized open.	7.8554925581440855
9517. it had been shut again but the lock was broken; he noted	with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch.	7.464718089608291
9518. what was he to do now?	17.138235265359828
9519.  he had thought no further than finding muller.	10.918931351420587
9520. he realized now he had more than half hoped he wouldn't find	him- that muller would not be here that the attempt would be scheduled	for somewhere beyond hoag's control.	8.460981252274793
9521. he could not break in on	an armed man.	12.246154729187973
9522. he would have to climb back down to the street and signal	a cop.	15.173901752613181
9523. was there time?	13.792598116558866
9524.    his thoughts were scattered by	the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door.	11.652286979350551
9525. hoag pushed	open the door: at the far end of the long dark room muller was	faintly silhouetted against the window the rifle still raised; he stood	with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill.	5.260267474524373
9526. he turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back	to the window and his rifle sight dismissing hoag for the moment	with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at hoag's apartment.	6.854168544685825
9527. hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled	for the switch: evil flourishes in the dark.	6.493967974587749
9528. the room was bathed in	light at the instant muller's second shot came.	9.174739856193675
9529. muller nakedly	exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car's headlights	threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table; his face	wore a look of outrage.	4.595688357851942
9530. a shot caught him and straightened him up in	screaming pain; a following volley of shots shattered glass ripped	the	ceiling and sent him lurching heavily from the table.	6.625285932929113
9531. he was dead	before his body made contact with the floor.	10.725742815089818
9532. hoag stumbled back into	the hall leaned against the wall and started to retch.	8.165685406101204
9533. after	captain docherty sent arleigh griffith for hoag he was able to	complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a	report from his man covering the floors above before griffith returned	buoyed up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne.	5.846316264310328
9534. the safe at ingleside district station stands next to the gum	machine in a narrow passageway that leads to captain harris's office	the lieutenant's office	and the janitor's supply closet.	7.102927361335862
9535. the	safe is a repository for three dead flashlight batteries a hundred	and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint cards a stack of unsold policemen's	ball tickets from last year and thirty-seven cents in coins	and stamps.	4.863954945259373
9536. gun set the captain's fifth of hiram walker inside	the safe before he reported to lt killpath though he knew that	killpath's ulcer prevented him from making any untoward incursion on	herman wolff's gift.	5.795373458792256
9537. it was more a matter of tact and also it	was none of killpath's goddam business.	9.631835081598096
9538. he walked up to the	lieutenant's office leaned wearily against the gun rack that housed	four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a submachine	gun that was occasionally tried out on the academy range.	6.664515562079166
9539. he stared	at the clerk who sat at a scarred and ancient fumed-oak desk stuffing	envelopes.	6.718491433348979
9540. where's the lieut?	13.148092146312546
9541.    the clerk	wagged his head toward the captain's office.	8.341215694113531
9542. gun went to the connecting	door which was open and stood at attention while orville torrence	killpath in full uniform finished combing his hair.	6.70329089811944
9543. the lieutenant's sparse brown hair was heavily pomaded and as killpath	raked the comb through it it stuck together in thatches so that	it looked like umbrella ribs clinging to his pink skull.	4.908401855518352
9544. the lieutenant	eyed gun's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and then	glanced back at his own face moving the comb methodically around his	head.	6.759075170978014
9545. leave me alone gun thought.	8.587897212087949
9546. fight with sam schaeffer	fight with the whole damned bureau.	8.97583737370944
9547. because	i'm looking for the son of a bitch that killed that old man and i'm	going to get him.	6.4978251600893495
9548. if you just leave me to hell alone lieutenant.	14.515882452352491
9549. killpath peered through half-closed lids at his reflection	thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and about-faced.	5.276337146317519
9550. gun waited for killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window.	7.198778874655976
9551. he sat stiff-backed in a chair that did not swivel though it was	obvious to gun that killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly	merited a swivel chair.	5.728385616492295
9552. the desk before him was in no better repair	than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room including wooden	file cabinets with some of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe	stained with the roof seepage of countless seasons.	7.564821394139843
9553. killpath	pulled one thin leg up clamping his arms around the shinbone to press	his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut.	5.083242045036259
9554. it was the posture which the	men had come to recognize as that of killpath defying his ulcer.	13.158168346144352
9555. he	put his chin on his kneecap stretching his neck like that of a turkey	on a chopping block and stared wordlessly at his sergeant.	5.64716074050781
9556. the 7:45 bell rang and he could hear the outside	doors bang shut closing in the assembled day watch.	7.972464856454861
9557. finally	orville intoned through his hawk nose we can't have people running	in any time they please sergeant.	5.155714308165967
9558. can't have it.	13.148092146312546
9559. makes for confusion and	congestion.	10.85553059437782
9560. he rocked back in the chair knee locked against stomach	his beady eyes fixed on matson.	9.264732953423893
9561. he was silent again possibly	listening to the sounds in the squadroom.	8.81770600605173
9562. gun cleared his throat.	11.568363037656766
9563. killpath said you were expected	to report to	my office twenty minutes ago sergeant.	5.825820622377272
9564. that's not getting	all the juice out of the orange now is it?	5.676220765717217
9565.    no sir.	17.961036902762967
9566. gun knew that nothing but aces back	to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at the same time.	7.295157359942498
9567. the day-watch platoon commander lt rinker was calling	out the beat assignments but matson couldn't make the names mean	anything.	5.780140237098333
9568. i called the station at three this morning	killpath's nasal voice pronounced.	9.713745980661573
9569. do you have any idea who might	have been in charge at the time?	9.464585145176281
9570.    sergeant vaughn	sir.	16.401825322142553
9571. now now you're just guessing sergeant.	9.565087858411951
9572. he	smiled thinly savoring his joke.	10.472119682746735
9573. what if i said nobody was here	but a couple of patrolmen?	9.809536200257417
9574.    sir vaughn knows better	than to leave the station without a relief.	11.098865587992254
9575. he must have-	he let a patrolman take over the duties of the station keeper.	9.972981994991574
9576. now	that's not regulation is it?	10.472119682746735
9577.    no sir.	17.961036902762967
9578. but you didn't know a thing about it did you?	11.959720553337062
9579.  killpath leaned	forward; his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again	frowning now.	5.648340237486337
9580. that's not taking one's command with a responsible	attitude matson.	5.0043554466587175
9581. gun told himself that the old bastard	was a fool.	6.815666006158545
9582. but stupidity was no consolation when it had rank.	11.921750304851345
9583. i was out in the district sir.	16.867251704441426
9584. he stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers	on his desk.	10.460253268689408
9585. i might point out that your inability to report to	my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not h ah	h limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped.	6.3875047167162835
9586. he took up a white sheet of paper dark with single-spaced data.	10.503327180421053
9587. a car pulled into the driveway outside the window.	7.563545188002981
9588. gun knew it	was car 12 the wagon returned from delivering ingleside's	drunk-and-disorderlies	to the city jail.	7.032105024464237
9589. but for some fool reason he couldn't	remember which men he'd put on the transfer detail.	7.664101394710116
9590. he stared	at the report in killpath's hand sure it was written by accacia-	just as sure as if he'd submitted it in his scrawled longhand.	7.453445896984611
9591. he	sucked in his breath and kept quiet while killpath laid down the sheet	again wound the gold-wire stems of his glasses around his ears and	then eying the report as it lay before him on the desk intoned acting	lieutenant gunnar matson one failed to see that the station	keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire	watch without checking on the station's activities or the whereabouts	of his section sergeants three permitted members of the homicide	detail of the inspector's bureau to arrogate for their own convenience	a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper	assignment four failed to notify the station commander acting captain	o t killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five	frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours spots for	purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six-	he leaned back and peeled off his glasses - failed to co-operate	with the acting captain by returning promptly when so ordered.	4.207545009438322
9592. what	have you to say to that sergeant?	9.964458074684218
9593.  killpath sailed the paper	across the desk but matson didn't pick it up or even glance at it.	5.236383152695367
9594. well?	19.804021762487697
9595.    i didn't think accacia knew so	many big words lieutenant.	6.320003807314731
9596. patrolman	accacia is an alert and conscientious law-enforcement officer.	8.887218524223295
9597. i don't think his diligence mitigates your negligence matson.	4.733174593885167
9598. negligence hell! gun held his breath a moment	pushing	the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his	throat.	6.365727389270327
9599. i would have been negligent and a goddam lousy cop to	boot if i'd sat around this station all night when somebody got	away with murder in my district.	6.457012227096904
9600. it's too bad i didn't call you	and it's too bad i let schaeffer use accacia when he could have	had a boy who'd be glad to learn something of homicide procedure.	4.5162879669825005
9601. but i'm not one damned bit sorry i went out to question the people	i know in the places they hang around and-   let's	not push our patience beyond the danger line sergeant killpath	nasaled.	5.219294226953131
9602. i shouldn't like to have to write you up for insubordination	as well as dereliction of duty.	9.338000564390374
9603. gun stiffened his hands	balling into fists at his sides.	6.460370037324521
9604. he clamped his jaws to keep the	fury from spilling out.	10.090191208524187
9605. an argument with orville torrence killpath	was as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing range.	5.567218969184224
9606. killpath leaned forward again rocked comfortably with his arms	still wrapped around one knee.	7.198778874655976
9607. let's just remember sergeant	that we must all carry our own umbrella.	5.373183103331538
9608. a district station can't	run smoothly unless- he interrupted himself looking around gun	at the doorway.	7.88014969880378
9609. i thought you hadn't come in yet.	10.811031912098686
9610. i've	been here for some time.	10.472119682746735
9611. he stood up cocked his head and eyed gun	coldly.	8.936790637584727
9612. the sergeant is just leaving.	13.848082117783294
9613. it had come as	no great surprise to matson that the hot water in the showers didn't	work that loren severe had thrown up all over the stairs or that	some thieving bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes.	5.60472638323512
9614. it	was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session	in killpath's office.	7.558066805449029
9615. now as he passed the open counter	that divided the assembly room from the business office he nodded	and said good night to the station keeper and his clerks not stopping	to hear the day-watch playback of his chewing out.	5.099771825076438
9616. not that he	gave a damn what the grapevine sent out about killpath's little speech	on the comportment of platoon commanders.	7.915179535500628
9617. he just didn't want	to talk about it.	11.244578594760805
9618. if the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant	to sit on his ass around the station all night killpath would just	have to go out and drag gun back by the heels once an hour; because	he'd be damned if he was going to be a mid-watch pencil-pusher just	to please his ulcerated pro-tem captain.	7.962402392096954
9619. at the doorway he squinted	up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for	the cigarettes remembering then that he'd left them at the doughnuttery.	6.2269536610610245
9620. he could pick up another pack on his way home if he were going	home.	12.947679664904548
9621. but even before he started across the oiled road to his plymouth	parked in the lot under the cypress trees across from the station	he knew that he wasn't going home.	6.260705965786049
9622. it	was nine o'clock in the morning: the hour which like a spade turning	clods of earth exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that	had lain dormant in the quiet night.	6.095627203023252
9623. mission street at this hour was	populated by a whole community that gun could not have seen on his	tour of duty- the neighborhood that had known urbano quintana by	day.	5.097768844765743
9624. sol phillips had purchased the alliance furniture	mart seventeen years ago.	7.879513779734377
9625. it was professedly worth three thousand dollars	in stock and good will and the name was written in gold in foot-high	letters across each of the two display windows.	7.357281475253275
9626. on the right	window at eye level in smaller print but also in gold was gonzalez	prop and under that se habla espanol.	8.689149284186371
9627. mr phillips	took a razor to gonzalez prop but left the promise	that spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that spanish	clientele would be welcome.	5.807261820546441
9628. language was no problem anyway;	mr phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from	the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of mission	street.	6.141018564392989
9629. aside from the fact that business was slow this	time	of year and his one salesgirl was not the most enterprising mr	phillips had no worries at all and he said as much to gun matson	who sat across from him in civilian clothes on a jiffy-couch-a-bed	mauve velour $79.	6.406283619882419
9630. 89 nothing-down special!   she's honest	as the day mr phillips said and added mr gunnar	i can say this to you: beebe is a little too honest.	6.80415857755805
9631. you can't	tell a customer how much it's going to cost him to refinance his payments	before he even signs for a loan on the money down! a time plan	is a mere convenience you understand and when- he interrupted	himself smiling.	5.001036923379987
9632. i put her in lamps.	19.168476557564315
9633. that way i don't lose	so much.	13.593734168111315
9634. why don't you just hire somebody else?	11.263243143073376
9635. 	she says she has to finish a story.	8.610012913503606
9636. i	asked her why she couldn't do it tomorrow but it seems the muse is	working good tonight and she's afraid to let it go.	7.000408661330232
9637. casey	made some comment but his mind was busy as he considered the man.	5.890344338293082
9638. his	name was george needham and he too had come from a good family.	9.138465587865305
9639. he was perhaps thirty-two nicely set up with light brown hair that	had a pronounced wave.	7.3535919669018925
9640. he was always well groomed and well tailored	and he had that rich man's look which was authentic enough and came	from two good prep schools and a proper university.	7.503381246787366
9641. an only child he	had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money	and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke.	5.541906517613796
9642. since then he had worked at this and that though some said his main	interest was gambling.	8.349326071772477
9643. all this went through casey's mind	in the first instant but what held his interest was the fact that	these two should be together at all.	5.6423408877191825
9644. for he had understood that betty	had been engaged to a boy named barry jenkins.	9.871467320798672
9645. she had grown up with	young jenkins and he had heard that they had been at the point of	getting married at least twice.	8.851084553096657
9646. he wanted to ask her about jenkins	now but he knew he couldn't do so in needham's presence.	12.759026029789597
9647. and so	still wondering and a little perplexed he grinned at the girl and	spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding.	6.153287755680425
9648. where did you pick him up?	12.04051079364257
9649.    oh i've known him quite	a while.	8.869713567468498
9650. she glanced at her companion fondly.	12.671390746668923
9651. haven't i	george?	12.292407525564322
9652.    i've been after her for years needham	said but i've never been able to get anywhere until the last	few days.	6.00807775536811
9653. the girl's eyes were softly shining as she reached	out and touched casey's hand.	6.578982329721101
9654. can i tell you a secret?	12.241857630548214
9655. 	we're going to get married.	9.193151629059258
9656. do you approve?	30.23431028108215
9657.    casey kept	his smile fixed but some small inner disturbance was working on him	as	he thought again about needham who was eight or ten years older than	the girl.	5.016082875082831
9658. he wondered whether needham was going to swear off gambling	and get a steady job or whether he was counting on the income from	betty's estate to subsidize him.	7.204281936780856
9659. none of this showed in his face	and he tried to keep his skepticism in hand.	8.717725202106307
9660. he made a point of frowning	of acting out the part of the fond father-confessor.	17.363623885380456
9661. i'll	have to give it some thought he said.	8.421726563527756
9662. you wouldn't want	me to say yes without making sure his intentions are honorable would	you?	9.165981822717155
9663.    she made a face at him and then she laughed.	7.533469760296565
9664. i'll get my references in order needham	said and though he spoke with a smile casey somehow got the idea	that he was not particularly amused.	5.640852739535696
9665. stop by any time casey.	9.629045873528531
9666. he stood up and touched the girl's arm.	12.32918527712499
9667. if	you're really serious about working on that story i'd better take	you home.	5.470833263778384
9668. casey watched them go still frowning absently	and then dismissing the matter as he called for his check.	6.953337243345167
9669. as he went	out he told freddie the dinner was perfect and when he got his hat	and coat from nancy parks and put a fifty-piece piece in the slot	he told her to be sure that it went toward her dowry.	5.8460683224366825
9670. a taxi	took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car and a few	minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment.	7.333585661023366
9671. because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple	of hours he did not think to look and see if jerry burton's	car was still there.	6.178311412935174
9672. in fact he did not think about jerry burton at	all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him.	9.615621603358813
9673. only then when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was	empty did he remember his earlier problem.	5.7104115345172275
9674. even from where he	stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over	burton the pillow the sheet of paper on top of it.	8.658121233021983
9675. then he was striding	across the room his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly	inside him as he snatched up the note.	6.100073531075903
9676. jack:	look in	the wastebasket.	13.148092146312546
9677. i knew the only way i could beat you was to play possum	but it was a good try kid and i appreciate it.	7.723893519396546
9678. j	the wastebasket stood near the wall next to the divan and the instant	casey picked it up he knew what had happened.	6.797890195505221
9679. the discarded papers	inside were sodden there was a glint of liquid at the bottom and	the smell of whisky was strong and distinct.	6.527733501288731
9680. he put the basket down	distastefully muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself	and his plan that had seemed so foolproof.	8.082238293010477
9681. for he remembered too well	how he had brought back the loaded drinks to burton and then returned	to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself.	6.081676676833635
9682. for another	second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself;	then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more	serious and as the thought expanded the implications jarred him.	6.721177813726227
9683. it	no longer mattered that burton had outsmarted him.	6.764147616291221
9684. the important thing	was that burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun	in his pocket.	8.175607234186513
9685. and that gun was empty.	16.26905287195387
9686. even before his mind	had rounded out the idea he thrust one hand into his trousers pocket	and pulled out the six slugs he had taken from the revolver.	7.713014303320637
9687. he considered	them with brooding eyes brows bunched as his brain grappled with	the problem and tried to find some solution.	6.743614190618342
9688. he said: the crazy	fool half aloud.	13.671139498061125
9689. he put the shells on the table as though he	could no longer bear to hold them.	7.56953932012892
9690. he thought: where the hell	could he have gone?	11.45143587764551
9691.  how can i find him?	13.798694057385854
9692.    there was no answer	to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room his	imagination out of control.	11.822757104647204
9693. he tried to tell himself that maybe burton	had sobered up enough to get some sense.	8.818807756068935
9694. maybe he only intended to	scare the blackmailer whoever he was in which case an unloaded gun	would be good enough.	8.594528182897653
9695. he thought of other possibilities none of them	satisfactory and finally he began to think to wonder if there was	some way he could reach burton.	6.418600809631403
9696. then as he turned toward the telephone	it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached	for it eagerly.	7.9136955469918995
9697. tony calenda.	12.292407525564322
9698. casey heard	the voice distinctly and he knew who it was but it took him a while to	make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his	head.	6.568293702227357
9699. when he heard calenda say: what about that picture you took	this afternoon?	8.56294043647447
9700.  it still took him another few seconds to remember	the job he had done for frank ackerly.	9.104207350109357
9701. you took a picture of me at the corner of	washington and blake about three thirty this afternoon.	7.363053419052398
9702. who says so?	18.948182413671855
9703.    one of my boys.	29.120826228793916
9704. calenda was not the sort who walked around without one	of his boys close at hand.	8.095513598658757
9705. so?	15.610129252044759
9706.    with	my trial coming up in federal court next week i wouldn't want that	picture published.	7.032105024464237
9707. who says it's going to be published?	10.730140671535784
9708. 	i wouldn't even want it to get around.	8.581436094141479
9709. under normal circumstances casey was a little fussy when people told	him what to do with pictures he had taken.	7.711678106143414
9710. even so he generally listened	and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections	properly.	10.862515415720477
9711. right now however he was still too worried about jerry	burton and the gun that had no bullets and the story burton had told	him to care too much about tony calenda.	5.021759007081566
9712. his nerves were getting	a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice.	7.407049836017958
9713. i was hired to take a picture.	13.515423079641023
9714. that's all i know about it and that's all i care.	5.446579851310273
9715. maybe	you'd better tell the guy who hired you what i said.	6.338907635937182
9716. all right calenda said his voice	still quiet.	11.369735003123072
9717. but i meant what i said casey.	12.800672623818418
9718. if that picture	gets around and i find out you had anything to do with it i'm	going to send a couple of my boys around to see you.	0.0
9719. you	do that casey said.	9.118533821976325
9720. just be sure to send your two best boys	tony.	11.650747985695698
9721. he hung up with a bang annoyed at himself for running	off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation	he had helped to create.	6.036795224973835
9722. as soon as he could think logically	again he reached for the telephone directory and found jerry burton's	home number.	9.84160711764459
9723. he dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before	he hung up.	6.955990454870539
9724. he called the bar and grill where he had picked burton	up that afternoon.	11.720742149285464
9725. when he was told that no one had seen burton since	then he thought of three other places that were possibilities.	9.816577108211186
9726. each	time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up.	10.235926509368435
9727. by	the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down.	6.002446559592496
9728. he had done	all he could and that was that.	14.774283550067736
9729. and anyway burton was not the kind	of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk.	7.136059644574391
9730. he casey had been scared for a while but that had come mostly from	the fact that he felt responsible.	9.63016008856077
9731. he should have stayed here and	watched burton.	10.629729299791055
9732. so he made a mistake.	21.517988580556814
9733. so what?	18.59128237484222
9734. 	he kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make	a drink.	9.418751908949478
9735. only then did he decide he didn't want one.	8.202551488033812
9736. he considered	opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too.	10.821413532385549
9737. finally he went into	the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes.	7.4415975647592285
9738. he had just finished	unlacing the right one when the telephone rang again.	11.647756301757601
9739. when he snatched	it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent.	8.1652396953117
9740. casey?	19.804021762487697
9741. 	you don't know me but i know you.	7.403782317067599
9742. if you want a picture	get to the corner of adams and clark just as fast as you can.	12.281888260938223
9743. if you	hurry you might beat the headquarters boys.	9.509064554218082
9744. casey heard the	click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth and it	took him no more than three seconds to make his decision.	7.728891300969694
9745. for over	the years he had received many such calls.	9.290002832984825
9746. some of them came from people	who identified themselves.	18.00041715922287
9747. some telephoned because he had done	them a favor in the past.	7.908561587082374
9748. others because they expected some sort of	reward for the information.	8.967010855918263
9749. a few passed along a tip for the simple	reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break.	6.732941992237565
9750. only	an occasional tip turned out to be a phony and like the police casey	had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not	hesitate this time.	7.8254003490872455
9751. he was in his car with his camera and equipment	bag in less than two minutes and it took him only three more	to reach the corner a block from columbus avenue.	6.777639040054995
9752. it was a district	of small factories and loft buildings and occasional tenements and	he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed	on the brakes.	8.43140585330406
9753. he did not bother with his radio- there would be time	for that later- but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the	filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how	he had been summoned.	6.423233980268475
9754. the police car had pulled up behind a	small sedan its headlights still on.	8.692816950710247
9755. slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving	at	little more than a crawl and watched elaine rapidly spin from one	station to another tune in the null then draw in a line on the chart.	4.6986338168856925
9756. we're out just a little too far.	8.231388558586541
9757. make a 90 degree straight	for shore.	10.3200230810868
9758. poet came in raising his eyebrows appreciatively	as he saw elaine.	7.879513779734377
9759. pretty quick	she replied.	10.686789592928747
9760. will you drop the anchor?	14.426380302955707
9761.    poet nodded	swung below and a moment later emerged from the forward hatch where	he picked up the anchor.	5.706796208540525
9762. the rock and roll music coming from the radio	station suddenly faded as the boat coasted into the null on the rdf.	7.480765934180597
9763. reverse elaine said then peered through the loop	of the rdf and waved to poet.	5.542917982132687
9764. a second later she came behind	the wheel and backed off the anchor line until it was set in the ocean	floor.	8.040362282484079
9765. she cut the engines and slowly the cruiser swung around on	the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the	cockpit faced toward the shore.	5.323212874448376
9766. nick watched her somewhat enviously as	she efficiently cut the engines and started the auxiliary motor.	7.20145901369959
9767. poet came up from below wearing new bathing trunks.	6.460370037324521
9768. the price	tag hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the chartroom	and looked at it curiously.	8.35195770629959
9769. nick wondered if elaine had bought them	but he said nothing.	6.210871206873012
9770. nobody he suddenly realized was saying anything.	10.694117775472467
9771. it seemed as if they were all under a spell.	15.390267451541506
9772. there should be an	excited conversation for somewhere directly below them was a treasure	lost for more than four hundred years.	11.373576963101192
9773. but instead of chatter	there was a null like on the radio direction finder.	7.407038838449361
9774. once in new	york he had gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane	with a single engine.	8.017505052746605
9775. they had all been laughing joking when	suddenly the engine had failed.	8.94304882371024
9776. no one had prayed.	22.280328944726612
9777. all had fallen into a complete silence listening to the wind whistle	over the wings.	6.3679245317677085
9778. the pilot had been good.	14.717419125242657
9779. he'd landed the plane	on a small airstrip in connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had	coasted to a stop everyone had burst into chatter at the same moment.	5.918556538736704
9780. there had been tension in the plane during the silent descent;	a tension similar to the one now.	10.422266469928877
9781. but in the plane there was a concrete	reason for it.	13.125732762028516
9782. now at this moment there should be none h unless	skin diving was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe.	9.10708203153312
9783. the same taut-nerved relationship as there	had been between the passengers on the plane now strained at the three	of them here on the boat.	6.146509968909198
9784. it hung over them like a cloud its arrival	as sudden as a cloud skidding over the sun.	8.565612180375407
9785. silently elaine	picked up her keys from the table and went out into the cockpit poet	behind her nick trailing behind him.	5.767836081502082
9786. she threw back a cushion over	one of the seats unlocked a padlock on the chest beneath it then	presently straightened holding a long knife and a wicked looking spear	gun in her hand.	6.770800824915481
9787. poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun.	6.968746590851131
9788. they are the	best.	26.204604952183743
9789. she kicked the locker lid shut and replaced the cushion.	7.533469760296565
9790. they are the most efficient.	26.045838823219967
9791. and the deadliest poet	commented as he buckled on his tank harness.	8.3115201837941
9792. why do you	need an arsenal?	13.663388853342104
9793.  nick asked apprehensively staring at the weapon.	7.14162538120728
9794. it's quite possible there's more than codfish down	there man poet replied with a short nervous laugh as he held	the harness for elaine.	4.6855296205937185
9795. a moment later moving awkwardly because	of the swimming fins she picked up the gun handed the knife to poet	then rolled off the transom of the boat back first.	5.4255342493524354
9796. poet nodded	to nick and entered the water in a similar fashion.	8.149408063313643
9797. another moment	and they were out of sight leaving behind only a string of bubbles as	a clue to their whereabouts.	0.0
9798. for a while nick followed the	twisting course of the bubbles wondering which set came from elaine.	10.746666733896244
9799. they remained close together their air trail wiggling like serpents	traveling side by side.	6.793852307633501
9800. eventually the bubbles became lost in the sparkle	of the ocean surface and he rolled over on his back.	7.703336839382465
9801. clasping	his hands behind his head he stared at the blue sky.	6.002446559592496
9802. there was	nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean.	11.065775357961698
9803. alfredo certainly	must have enjoyed being alone.	7.622507342753323
9804. next to the ocean probably the	loneliest spot was the desert.	12.326874534722377
9805. if elaine's uncle had stuck to this	desire for aloneness he probably would still be alive.	7.288703696461154
9806. yet alfredo	wanted money h wanted money to roam through the deserts.	8.783628152824377
9807. and	graham wanted money probably to roam among the dice tables in las	vegas.	5.825820622377272
9808. it was an odd combination h a strange pair to stumble upon	the wreck of the trinidad.	10.707464937364284
9809. but graham hadn't stumbled on it.	11.276709257332119
9810. two to three weeks prior to the charter of the virginia graham	had been snooping around the san luis rey mission.	9.174672741667946
9811. the small	helicopter with its two steel skids churned offshore and nick raised	up to watch it heading south.	5.902564164932943
9812. that was a hell of a note he thought.	14.304933511210336
9813. a couple couldn't even find a secluded spot anywhere on a beach	to neck nowadays without someone swooping down upon them.	6.710739962299863
9814. if the character	flying that thing had gone over san clemente island yesterday	he would have had an eyeful.	9.870332853210217
9815. off to the west a beautiful schooner	slowly beat its way into the wind headed on a tack toward san	clemente.	7.892017203100846
9816. behind it a cabin cruiser drifted crossways in the small	ground-swell a lone fisherman in the chair aft.	7.549846296533712
9817. the fisherman was right	in the middle of the deep.	12.139423670736546
9818. nick recalled stories that the two best	fishing spots in southern california were over the la jolla deep	and the redondo deep two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic	depths almost from the shoreline.	6.044299927214209
9819. someday geologists	had warned the land on both sides of these deeps would fall into the	ocean and no more la jolla or redondo beach.	6.292214312459591
9820. meanwhile fishermen	took advantage of them to pull up whoppers.	11.4630655167699
9821. sometimes the fish exploded	as they neared the surface because of the difference in pressure.	8.405989892004232
9822. why he wondered had elaine wanted him along on this trip?	8.932838799082655
9823. 	he couldn't skindive he couldn't run a boat except on the open	sea.	5.825820622377272
9824. he stood up stretched looked around for the bubbles but could	see none.	9.176540466704445
9825. strolling down to the galley he lit the butane under the	coffee pot and when the brew was heated poured himself a cup and went	up to the chartroom.	5.290027356459293
9826. turning on the hi-fi he went back to the cockpit	stretched out on the cushions and listened to the music.	9.134473375556533
9827. elaine	and poet returned together popping up over the transom almost	like dolphins breaking water.	5.674295354649883
9828. he sat up and watched as they pulled	themselves over the stern.	9.805655982032302
9829. poet	shook his head sliding his face mask up on his forehead.	6.002446559592496
9830. we're right on the edge of the deep elaine said.	11.683201647763704
9831. pulling	off her face mask she carefully placed the spear gun across the stern	then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water.	4.76581317220898
9832. which	is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile	she added as she swung her legs over the transom.	6.533109828340079
9833. any news?	15.009412063232862
9834. 	not a thing.	13.148092146312546
9835. he tossed her a towel then repeated the	service for poet.	7.953394054598466
9836. cigarette?	19.804021762487697
9837.    elaine shook her head	as she slipped out of her harness but poet nodded.	5.969802314021069
9838. his feet still hung	over the stern of the transom but as he reached for the smoke he	raised them to swing them in.	7.08338320394739
9839. the fin on his foot caught on the moulding	throwing him off balance.	6.817408452020724
9840. his forearm smashed painfully into the	narrow washboard and he grimaced as he grabbed his bruised limb with	his other hand and rolled into the boat.	6.409188347120729
9841. kee-reist! the	word hissed distinctly from poet's lips as he struggled to his feet.	5.674295354649883
9842. turning slowly he saw poet	in a brilliant glare of horror.	9.079234361089874
9843. poet! his face was still creased in	pain as he studied the underside of his arm.	6.076559550927458
9844. poet a murderer?	13.148092146312546
9845.  turning	quickly toward elaine nick saw that she too stood in shocked	surprise.	6.002446559592496
9846. the sudden silence was too silent.	12.435529358277208
9847. instinctively	aware of the charged atmosphere poet raised his head slowly looking	first at elaine.	5.674295354649883
9848. she had caught the implication of the oath.	13.744732884676733
9849. her face was frozen into the mask of a mannequin her body absolutely	motionless.	6.183003451448296
9850. and then nick knew that all of them knew h elaine	himself h and poet.	12.179334267186501
9851. elaine recovered first so quickly	that nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction.	6.564895438829204
9852. do	you need a bandage?	12.886172342385436
9853.  she asked steadily.	23.0547882925987
9854. it's like banging a shin he said his eyes lingered	on nick's face then moved back to elaine.	4.210250940207141
9855. hurts like hell for	a second then it disappears.	6.764147616291221
9856. elaine turned and started toward the companionway.	9.799821426480841
9857. but her walk	was too steady too slow telegraphing her fear.	8.956819770028424
9858. so did poet.	21.219408643065556
9859. springing like a cat he leaped back swooped up the	spring gun and whirling pointed it toward the cabin.	5.15576524365156
9860. at the same	instant nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man.	9.91192618671525
9861. the gun fired next to his ear with a vicious whoosh like the first stroke	of an old steam engine.	5.670580783382225
9862. at the same instant elaine screamed wildly	the sound ending abruptly as nick went off the boat and into the	water on top of the frantic struggling poet.	9.775915445011245
9863. the moment the	sea closed over nick some atavistic sense warned him that he would	survive in this alien element only if he did not panic.	6.541385697111927
9864. but the murderer	to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage.	12.25687715443773
9865. the wide flippers	on poet's feet gave his legs incredible power driving the two of them	down into the water as they rolled over and over.	5.411135972127183
9866. poet was the captured	arms pinioned to his side and he twisted convulsively trying	to escape.	7.032105024464237
9867. poet would escape nick thought grimly because he wore the	apparatus which would keep him alive under water.	5.236383152695367
9868. but nick would	not let go.	16.181449055670814
9869. the rubber and glass face mask slipped from poet's	forehead bounced painlessly off nick's chin then disappeared.	6.040227447879625
9870. poet twisted again and nick's knuckles scraped on the air tank ripping	off the skin.	0.0
9871. for a split second nick relaxed his grip and poet's	slippery body spun completely around before nick could stop	him holding him now from the rear.	5.947506138900282
9872. something flailed at the side of	nick's head as they rolled around and around.	7.82065044720888
9873. suddenly poet	stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water	not rising not sinking.	7.539041506834666
9874. a sharp pain lanced across nick's chest and	a bubble of air escaped from his tortured lungs joining dozens of	others that sailed lazily toward the surface like helium balloons rising	into the sky.	6.236647835329602
9875. a black snake-like object swayed eerily in front of	him spewing bubbles from its flat cobra head.	5.901300571347011
9876. the air hose was free!	the discovery struck nick like a blow.	10.26712911461418
9877. desperately nick	flashed one hand up catching poet's neck in the bend of his elbow.	5.542917982132687
9878. at the same instant he grabbed the loose writhing hose with his	other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece.	9.899557906944723
9879. instinctively	he exhaled through his nose then sucked in the air from the hose.	6.357828940933421
9880. at	once the excruciating pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with	a sudden wild exultation.	8.009492186306446
9881. as if this was a signal poet abruptly	began to thrash the water and the quick movement slowly made them	sink through the water.	8.005576324297841
9882. relentlessly nick held on sucking on the	hose inhaling the air that belonged to poet.	7.032105024464237
9883. poet was not fighting	nick now.	8.254441635698543
9884. harbor point sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck	of a steamer clam.	7.783496754152731
9885. it's a rich village but not much for action- too	many solid residents not enough tourists or working stiffs.	2.8645273052810962
9886. it's	at the far end of the county and the last time i came here was for	a hit and run manslaughter- about seven months ago.	0.0
9887. chief bob	moore looked his same hick-self; a man mountain running to lard	in his middle-age.	5.8860979088200995
9888. seeing me he said with real surprise well well	ain't we honored! hardly expected the head of county homicide	up for this murder.	7.1869976971301694
9889. you sure climbed fast jed.	13.44371259307425
9890. rookie investigator	last summer and now it's inspector jed.	9.340573795225142
9891. took me 19 years	to become chief of our three man police force.	5.825820622377272
9892. proves a college	education pays off.	10.472119682746735
9893. his sarcasm was followed by a stupid grin of his	thick mouth and bad teeth.	6.957522633124658
9894. i guess it helps i said	paying no attention to his ribbing.	9.713745980661573
9895. never could figure out	why you ever wanted to be a cop jed.	7.872551571393695
9896. you're not only young but h	well you don't even look like a police officer.	6.568722368971689
9897. a runt with	narrow shoulders and that brush haircut h hell you'd pass for a	juvenile delinquent of the hotrod set.	5.556996210447807
9898. in my day the first requirement	for a cop was to look like the law big and tough.	10.03530089465117
9899. man when my 275	pounds and six-four comes along why it's the same as another badge.	6.991511491253528
9900. when i say move a guy moves!   don't worry about	my being tough moore.	10.023170022092753
9901. also it's far too early in the day for corny	lines like the bigger they come h you've had your gassy lecture	let's get to work.	6.0069646851245215
9902. who was the murdered woman h mrs buck?	11.465359098595414
9903. 	widow nice sort of woman.	8.254441635698543
9904. came to the harbor as a bride and h don't worry	jed this one is in the bag.	8.0815273587822
9905. i know the killer have the only road	off the peninsula covered.	9.235895597698871
9906. yeah passed your road block	as i drove in i said sitting on his polished desk.	7.130716134282969
9907. although	bob dressed like a slob he kept a neat office.	6.452430126248838
9908. okay what happened?	13.148092146312546
9909. 	about nine this morning mrs buck phones me she's	having trouble with one of her farm hands- money trouble.	6.393362306737407
9910. colored	fellow named tim williams- only hand she has working for her	now.	7.615092762846159
9911. tim come with the migratory workers that follow the crops up from	the south last year but tim and his wife settled here.	5.959454296096567
9912. never had	no trouble with him before thought he was a hard worker hustling around	to get a full week's work.	8.474623429207004
9913. anyway julia asks me to h.	8.134693648553869
9914. julia?	19.804021762487697
9915.    come on inspector look alive.	8.724941562995992
9916. julia buck the deceased moore said slipping me his smug idiot-grin	again.	7.615092762846159
9917. julia asks me to come out at once.	7.457752026677368
9918. but she didn't	sound real alarmed h you know like there was any immediate danger.	9.525292416183285
9919. i got there at 9:47 am found her strangled.	8.555241096529764
9920. i would have	come sooner if i'd known h.	14.369461809796423
9921. no doubt about tim being the killer-	i have a witness.	9.60088282401826
9922. don't know why the county had to send anybody	up here.	4.363650715767831

9927. who's your	witness?	12.292407525564322
9928.    julia had- has- an old indian woman cooking	for her- nellie harris.	7.615092762846159
9929. probably the last of the original island	indians.	14.733006278381518
9930. nellie was in the kitchen had just come to work when	she heard tim arguing with julia in the living room.	8.027846222997388
9931. swears she	recognized his voice that tim yelled 'it's my money and i want	it'! and then rushed out of the house.	5.497012601758184
9932. then she heard julia phone	me.	16.087227891890386
9933. nellie went on with her house work- until i found julia dead.	5.825820622377272
9934. and before you say it nellie ain't near strong enough to have	strangled julia.	9.055736407309672
9935. there's no doubt this tim sneaked back and killed	mrs buck.	4.310085652005411
9936. another fact: tim's disappeared- on the run.	10.012878786259575
9937. but there's no way off the point except through my road block.	6.153172426787273
9938. guess	you want to see the body- have her up the street in doc abel's	office.	8.220701993984127
9939. we walked up main street	to this big white house then around to the back.	7.111035778232825
9940. being the harbors	sole doctor abel was also its medical examiner.	8.59507477522854
9941. the corpse was	on a table covered by a sheet.	8.343459063383007
9942. doc abel was busy up front with some	of his live patients.	7.615092762846159
9943. pulling back the sheet i examined the bruises	around julia buck's once slender throat.	5.674295354649883
9944. powerful hands had killed	her.	11.568363037656766
9945. find any prints?	15.913986167299297
9946.    chief moore shook his big	head seemed lost in thought as he stared at the nude body.	7.132972503588475
9947. then he	said never noticed it before h i mean when she was dressed h	but for a woman her age julia had a real fine figure.	5.653970971280281

10142.    the boy	raised his eyes.	15.841500723885778
10143. if you want my advice pack up	and take the next train back to new york.	9.122736274151693
10144. were you on	duty here two weeks ago?	9.060328853487057
10145.    the boy hesitated.	16.691720768716127
10146. but i wouldn't spend a night in here for a million	bucks!   he was in a hurry to get out of the room.	12.920125626728964
10147. alec	gave him a tip and let him go.	7.316221426124328
10148. alone alec examined the doors.	10.472119682746735
10149. there were three- one leading to a bathroom one to the hall and	one to the room next door which was immovable- locked or bolted on	the other side.	6.857583759410922
10150. alec locked the hall door and put the key with his	watch on the bedside table.	6.886249538313906
10151. it was just quarter of nine.	16.79056552587768
10152. as	he ranged his belongings on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust	on the dark surface of the wood beyond the linen cover.	6.9573818983305005
10153. not gray like	the dust that collects in an unused room but white.	6.907330826728996
10154. women didn't	use white face powder nowadays he recalled.	8.890874774374288
10155. they used pink tan or	cream powder.	10.352492626598039
10156. alec glanced into the bathroom.	10.472119682746735
10157. blood in the	bathtub where the murderer appears to have washed his hands.	5.953990336323622
10158. it seemed	clean now but alec decided against a bath.	12.356930286633146
10159. he crawled into bed and	switched off the light.	9.026368296067464
10160. in the darkness he could see the rosy	reflection of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window.	10.97480490736344
10161. it winked	as steadily as a metronome- on off- on off.	9.093323993376403
10162. in less than	five minutes	alec was asleep.	14.227369829482376
10163. he never knew just what woke him.	10.29055358604462
10164. yet	suddenly he was wide-awake.	11.568363037656766
10165. there was no sound and apparently no movement	in the room except the noiseless pulsation of the red light on	the wall.	8.320189136133957
10166. he lay still listening to the silence watching the	light.	10.697093789223626
10167. somewhere in the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn notes-	midnight.	10.326748415165481
10168. according to the medical examiner she was shot between	eleven pm and one am h.	10.079940622430705
10169. alec heard a faint sound.	8.254441635698543
10170. his heart seemed to swell and knock against the wall of his chest.	8.685507619036454
10171. for the sound was inside the room.	11.508743234048968
10172. he let his eyelids droop	and breathed heavily feigning sleep.	10.697093789223626
10173. the sound was coming nearer.	12.947693295611707
10174. a	monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall distorted and indefinable.	7.879513779734377
10175. when the neon sign faded out the shadow disappeared.	9.704619657859853
10176. when the neon sign flashed on the shadow was still there.	10.835114532228467
10177. it stretched	to an impossible height climbing the wall to the ceiling.	9.905847024002107
10178. that	meant that something between the light and its reflection on the wall	was moving closer to the source of the light- in this case the window.	8.701018069086702
10179. cautiously alec tensed his muscles ready to jump.	6.764147616291221
10180. the bedsprings	betrayed him with a creak.	13.499449391363237
10181. someone	had moved beyond the range of the light from the window.	7.298341745480555
10182. abandoning	caution alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch.	8.960381713898284
10183. before he could snap it on a stinging blow caught him in the ribs.	9.293960504603698
10184. he lashed out blindly with his right.	12.411802052220429
10185. there was a thick squashy crack	of fist on flesh.	14.374086352143031
10186. something hard grazed his knuckles.	12.246287563936663
10187. he	put everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought	to be.	5.427950274147271
10188. rough cloth rasped his fist.	10.472119682746735
10189. there was a grunt curiously	inarticulate like that of an animal in pain.	13.80942789113019
10190. something heavy shook	the floor as it dropped.	10.298065780877309
10191. alec waited a moment on guard.	7.622507342753323
10192. again he groped for the light switch.	10.845474991152743
10193. the blue	rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room.	7.614187831297698
10194. on the	bare floorboards a man lay face down.	11.635031451158836
10195. he had a short heavy powerful	body.	15.837126840237762
10196. alec turned him over and discovered a round lumpy face	with narrow slanting eyes- a primitive tartar face from russia	or the balkans.	6.290129093830134
10197. the man's shoes were too pointed his overcoat too	broad at the shoulders and too narrow at the waist.	4.909188983539079
10198. there was	a slight bulge under the left armpit- a shoulder holster.	12.045760172508219
10199. alec promptly	removed the gun.	9.118533821976325
10200. he was familiar with this type.	18.610126092812646
10201. he had seen it	in the lineup at police headquarters in new york in broadway night	clubs and seventh avenue pool rooms in the criminal courts.	7.382070035792819
10202. but	he was surprised to meet it here.	10.104213841520648
10203. diana beauclerk had no connection	with the underworld.	7.14162538120728
10204. a professional gunman would not have killed	her with a weapon of such small caliber as a .	8.284972290739534
10205. nor would he	choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing when it would be	so much safer to take his victim for a one-way ride on a lonely country	road.	5.183042155458108
10206. he opened his eyes.	19.23300488358196
10207. what are you doing here?	17.632317597370832
10208.  demanded alec.	15.594944937291627
10209. the man	made no reply.	12.486750257698887
10210. his lips were bruised and swollen	where alec had hit him.	8.699012786417118
10211. did you kill diana beauclerk?	11.726643105254862
10212. 	alec expected an indignant denial but there was no response	at all.	10.182206906163243
10213. oh come on snap out of it! or i'll turn	you over to the police! the silence was getting on alec's	nerves.	5.93150127816879
10214. the man opened his mouth but no words came.	13.596832499555417
10215. only that	curious animal grunting alec had heard during their fight.	7.395484348269232
10216. don't you speak english?	4.112779170864945
10217.    the man opened his mouth	wider.	15.29200528341881
10218. a forefinger pointed toward his gullet.	11.87006678428286
10219. alec leaned forward to	look.	9.118533821976325
10220. there were hideous scars inside the throat and the palate was	mutilated.	12.647783970494853
10221. in good time i shall get to the distressing actuality to red mciver	and handley walker to murder and sudden death.	6.323022086312158
10222. but you realize	i am sure how much old deeds incite to new ones and you must forgive	me if i tell you first of the old ones.	8.461385097338765
10223. it was in 1814 that	abraham wharf and his sister sat by a meager fire in their house	on dogtown common a desolate place even then.	7.531617464748053
10224. he was sharpening his	razor.	23.792940596339033
10225. sister said he do you think people who commit suicide	go to heaven?	6.522574161349563
10226.  and she answered i don't know but i hope	you'll never do such a thing.	8.420011246553958
10227. without a tremor god forbid!	he said and went out and cut his throat in the cave near granny	day's swamp.	5.855095875986525
10228. what has this to do with the present?	14.096933518045741
10229.  much	i assure you.	10.363724110347151
10230. you must know what gets into people even such as	red and handley before you can tell what comes out of them.	8.349206971671933
10231. they	had learned both of them about abraham wharf.	6.764147616291221
10232. that's why i	beg	you not to forget him.	4.758361768603671
10233. his ghost is not laid.	9.627882438407596
10234. red and handley god	help them knew the old dogtown lore; and i knew they knew it for	i'd told them a lot of it.	7.158743000996661
10235. and isn't it true that you get a deeper	perception about a man and his motives when you know what it is	he knows?	7.154238887010776
10236.    yes gentlemen i am getting to the point to my	point.	12.399655486416956
10237. you know the facts; they are set forth in your own newspapers.	10.835128151736724
10238. you want from me the story but a story is about 'why' and then	perhaps about 'how'.	9.020229890999294
10239. the 'when' you know; yesterday morning.	9.802060557618772
10240. so what i am trying to tell you is the 'why'- that is my	point- and that concerns the spirit of the matter.	10.084819981834093
10241. there is an	inwardness and a luster to old furniture	which has a provocative emanation if i may say so.	8.077209915779783
10242. places	too have their haunting qualities.	10.472119682746735
10243. and my point	in this sad story is the spirit of the matter.	10.333811280879132
10244. when you hold the spirit	of a thing then somehow you know the truth- you know a fake antique	from the real thing.	9.248635554121693
10245. and the truth is what you've come for is	it not?	10.560889276599694
10246.    now dogtown is one of those places that creeps into	the marrow as worms get into old wood under the veneer.	9.067193315744522
10247. in fact	all the folk who lived on the back of cape ann they are not just like	others.	9.016125019673632
10248. there's a different hall-mark on them.	4.695322059037497
10249. there were no witch	burnings here because everyone had a witch in the family.	9.597659189833779
10250. just think	of old granther stannard who pulled the teeth of dark younger	and because he bungled the job and left	two protruding tusks she put such a hex on him that he thought his legs	were made of glass.	6.669711102223252
10251. after that he was never known to run or even walk	fast.	9.649581741423283
10252. today dogtown is the only deserted village in all new england	that i know of.	9.484579271853189
10253. there it sits a small highland with towns like	gloucester near by; but now it's the most lost and tortured place	in the world.	6.126620333011741
10254. those who lived in that desolation of rocky deformity	took on some of the moraine's stony character.	11.17726995198261
10255. scientists say it	is the last spewings of a great glacier but one rather feels that only	a malevolent giant could have piled up those crouching monsters of granite	which still seem to preserve a sort of suspended ominous life	in them.	4.9975063015927415
10256. we'll walk up there later.	6.1280579316837445
10257. it's perhaps a mile from	here where we sit.	3.045018931533812
10258. and not one single dwelling left there though	once in the early eighteenth century there were close to a hundred	houses.	9.203372051137928
10259. even i can	remember nothing but ruined cellars and tumbled pillars and nobody has	lived there in the memory of any living man.	7.026819527054193
10260. it is now a sweep of boulders	and ledges with oak walnut and sumac creeping across the common	and everywhere the ruins and the long long shadows.	8.873051843863433
10261. that's	your setting and a sinister one.	7.622507342753323
10262. please get that in your reports.	9.670406878971576
10263. it accounts for so many things.	15.469609066243708
10264. both red mciver and handley walker	lived nearby almost as near as i do.	7.893095814049571
10265. red lived at lanesville	and from his house he could be up on the common in a half hour's	brisk walk; handley lived further on at pigeon cove.	0.0
10266. i'd often	find one or other of them up around dogtown sketching.	5.893271152772876
10267. they were	both	painters well	anyhow dogtown common is so much off the beaten track nowadays	that only sunday picnickers still stray up there from time to	time.	5.617690514368088
10268. sea-road railroad lack of water killed dogtown.	9.801857274312379
10269. dead dead	as a brass door nail and i sometimes feel like the sexton for i'm	about the last to be even interested.	5.966017009814404
10270. i knew red and handley	well.	18.703116319546275
10271. as i said they were both painters.	13.389741006724769
10272. they'd come separately	to gloucester some twenty years ago- there's always been an	artists' colony somewhere on cape ann- and each married here.	6.290129093830134
10273. they married cousins anta and freya norberg.	9.433178351824823
10274. there are a lot of	scandinavians in this neck of the woods and many still make painted	furniture and take steam-baths.	10.575644592147752
10275. pretty girls among them with blonde	hair and pert faces.	6.568040904258867
10276. handley married freya and red of the red beard	married anta.	9.04168670581374
10277. and it was because of an old norberg inheritance that	i got to understand them all so well.	8.149916229065486
10278. the quarrel ended in a ridiculous	draw but i must tell you about it.	8.573073452570451
10279. oh yes i'm quite sure	it's important because of the beech pasture.	7.6615516804272366
10280. what's that?	10.658282670269122
10281. 	why that's what gave me the feeling gave me as-it-were the spirit	the demoniac evil spirit of this whole affair.	5.083242045036259
10282. you see besides	being custodian of antiquities i am also registrar.	10.781441329716351
10283. no i don't	hold with those who live entirely among dead things.	8.21945529046286
10284. i know as	well as the next man that a ship is called from the rigging she carries	where the live wind blows and not from the hull.	7.230535095967661
10285. but you've got	to know both.	12.754707820148809
10286. what's below the water-line interests me also.	7.361768780586858
10287. as i	was saying i've known all about the old records including the old	norberg deed.	6.749244774219272
10288. some ten years ago that page was torn out i don't	know by whom.	0.0
10289. about five years ago handley came to ask me if he	could see the tattered register.	7.300770315394
10290. he was courteous and casual about it	as though it were of no consequence.	10.487600528194417
10291. he's always like that in spite	of being a big man.	4.003371155515014
10292. of fingering i might almost say stroking a large mole with black hairs	a sensual man but very courteous some	would say slick.	7.272364009841689
10293. like his glossy black hair.	11.85368945158854
10294. too many outside manners	to my taste.	16.04642406320357
10295. he is the sort who with an appraising eye would	cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then pinch her.	6.5151637924114105
10296. a real gentleman i feel would do neither.	10.72932062241581
10297. he's always worn	a broad-brimmed hat and i've noticed in my small study at the society	that he rather smells of cosmetics.	4.237263629743823
10298. the next week cousin red	wandered in as casually but curt and untidy.	9.630122568915404
10299. red was small and fine-boned	like ivory-inlay.	9.46426985577303
10300. he too asked to see the same page.	14.085513688788064
10301. when i	told him someone had torn it out he shouted.	7.975657520711742
10302. by god it's that	damn handley the sneak! and later in the same week they both	came together to examine the register.	8.358370636358398
10303. fortunately we were alone in	the building- so few people nowadays are interested even in their own	past or in the lovely craft of other days- for they began to abuse	each other in the foulest language.	5.051601810475467
10304. red thrusting out his tawny beard	handley glowering under his suddenly rumpled black hair.	8.176108302188684
10305. le rouge et le noir.	8.394614028573898
10306. red always	was morose yet that day the dapper handley was the louder of the	two.	7.930518924162958
10307. but for my presence they would have been at each others' throats.	12.271505182663505
10308. during the quarrel i learned what the trouble was from	the accusations each hurled at the other.	9.883050324422099
10309. the beech pasture had	suddenly	become valuable.	10.915477388587384
10310. there's a fine granite quarry there and granite's	coming back for public buildings.	4.705349682081825
10311. both men knew it was in the	norberg family holdings but to which of the cousins did it belong	anta or freya?	6.725900621460134
10312.  fortunately i knew almost exactly what the will	had said.	9.075813551354416
10313. it began with a preamble of course.	12.500673361276684
10314. this explained that the	judge of probate of essex county 1785 or 1786 appointed three free-holders	of gloucester to divide and establish the norberg estate.	6.978391389128306
10315. after the usual honorable sirs it went on to say that there had	been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of	the deceased salu norberg one lower room on the western side privileges	to the well and bake-oven and to one third of the cellar	also one cow right and lastly	they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as	dower namely the beech pasture.	5.849892673432795
10316. and i remember that the whole of	the privileges not counting the beech pasture was valued at twenty	pounds.	9.46251019193315
10317. i wish you could have seen the crests fall on these two sparring	coxcombs when i told them that obviously the pasture belonged	to their wives jointly.	6.408726874931109
10318. that battle scene ridiculous at it was	remained in my mind.	9.867826324417488
10319. a disturbing picture of bad blood to be further	heightened with illicit if buccolic colors for on a subsequent day	i saw handley escorting anta red's wife up on dogtown common.	4.921499038542727
10320. i felt it would be inopportune to disclose my presence.	11.695749990523437
10321. not that	i intentionally go unperceived but the boulders up there are very high	and i am a small woman.	6.389416886416705
10322. one other cause of jealousy between them	i must tell you.	9.98162729088661
10323. paint! gloomy and unkempt as red mciver was	he was much the better painter.	5.674295354649883
10324. i suppose handley knew it.	18.265483552057145
10325. if red	had a show at gloucester handley would hurry to hang his pictures in	rockport.	6.955925656704601
10326. you may say this has little pertinence but gentlemen	remember that all this prepared my mind alerted my intelligence.	8.779039166366374
10327. by	such touches the pattern takes shape.	7.622507342753323
10328. you would call these the motives	of crime.	14.740208339509758
10329. i would call them the patterns of life perhaps even the	designs of destiny.	8.164794394656553
10330. yet with all this knowledge i had nothing of substance	to unravel our case as you would call it till yesterday.	8.17119140179726
10331. one month ago on the 20th of october was the opening of the gunning	season in massachusetts.	8.060868187006784
10332. not much to shoot but there are a few	pheasant.	14.129476729439812
10333. rabbits too if you care for them which most of the folk	around here haven't the sense to appreciate.	6.01265605802985
10334. any more than they have	the sense to eat mussels.	12.338033524208598
10335. that was the day red was said to have	gone away.	12.46088502527346
10336. oh yes he'd talked about doing so.	10.398550832016166
10337. in fact he often disappeared	from time to time- off to paint the sea aboard a dragger	out from gloucester.	7.477996373266558
10338. anta his wife never seemed to mind.	10.064186585403892
10339. i suppose	these absences gave her more clearance for her embraces with cousin	handley.	7.319167417194751
10340. anyhow i wasn't surprised early that morning to see	handley himself crossing from dogtown common road to the back	road.	6.54093796655646
10341. no he didn't have his gun which he should have.	7.591133834134149
10342. it would	have been a good excuse for his being there at all.	10.317580793410237
10343. i myself had been	up there by seven o'clock after mushrooms since there'd been a	week of rain which had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear	as sandwich glass.	5.564820757044114
10344. that's what the man had said.	5.0137363084105155
10345. haney peered doubtfully at his	drinking companion through bleary tear-filled eyes.	6.210871206873012
10346. he had no ready	answer as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing.	10.43837655131038
10347. was the	man drunk or crazy or both?	8.56621628280458
10348.  but his new-found buddy had matched him	drink for drink until he lost count and the man's eyes were still	clear.	8.330631160458484
10349. the guy is off his rocker haney thought to himself	and looked away from those eyes.	6.424230161236276
10350. eyes that were clear but also bright	with a strange intensity a sort of cold fire burning behind them.	7.11028347841323
10351. why hadn't he noticed it before?	9.684323749366209
10352.  no the man was not drunk h	he wondered how he got tied up with this stranger.	8.542953034322647
10353. but of course	he remembered now.	12.754707820148809
10354. it was blurred after two hours of steady drinking	but the occasion of it came back to him.	10.437845761237792
10355. the stranger his head	seemingly sunk in thought started to cross the street against the	light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection.	5.259904251726102
10356. brakes howled and a horn blared furiously but the man would have	been hit if phil hadn't called out to him a second before.	6.415932087413076
10357. his shout	had been involuntary something anybody might have done without thinking	on the spur of the moment.	6.156463064223487
10358. as a matter of fact he wouldn't	have cared at all if the guy had been hit.	12.784590281080657
10359. actually he regretted having	opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver	jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them.	5.745220990795273
10360. by then	the stranger was thanking haney profusely and had one arm around his	shoulders as if he were an old friend.	8.341326933857141
10361. so the driver started to curse	at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his	safe-driving record.	8.937890524560025
10362. then the man he saved turned and looked	squarely into the truck driver's face without saying a word.	8.070563353430112
10363. very	suddenly the driver stopped swearing at them turned on his heel and	went back to his truck.	5.499255214453805
10364. haney hadn't given it much thought at	the time.	8.581436094141479
10365. now he recalled it very clearly and wondered what the truck	driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off.	6.093982830698962
10366. it must have	been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word.	11.422110310779983
10367. when the light went their way they went on across the street.	8.108546705266287
10368. and	when the stranger found out that phil was on the way to one of his	favorite bars he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them.	8.985272895340177
10369. phil usually went alone and kept to himself sitting in a corner	and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges.	5.0176589645046334
10370. but he decided	he wouldn't mind company in return for free drinks even though	he made good money at his job.	9.270558604894687
10371. now	he wondered	if it was worth it having a screwball for company.	6.583633325843117
10372. he really	didn't take the offer seriously but he began to feel uneasy.	10.36845009879809
10373. when	he finally got the coughing under control he realized that pete	was still waiting for an answer- he didn't	even seem to wink as he continued to stare.	4.750645921087632
10374. haney managed	a weak laugh.	11.568363037656766
10375. guess i can't think of anyone pete.	7.199111221629212
10376. a faint crease appeared between the man's eyebrows.	10.179668886367091
10377. i think you aren't taking me seriously phil.	14.193748186515572
10378. and	everybody has some kind of grudge.	11.619512176303008
10379. i might have got hit by that truck	if it wasn't for you.	7.761710231167913
10380. i believe in returning favors.	25.63722078909603
10381. i'll do	anything for somebody i like.	4.8393280814891115
10382. it won't cost you a cent phil.	9.54068311234232
10383. go	ahead and try me!   phil rubbed his forehead wearily.	6.460370037324521
10384. he	was beginning to feel woolly.	10.649951465826932
10385. maybe it would be better to humor the	guy and then make an exit.	8.066699098167911
10386. he really didn't expect anything to come	of it and there were a few people h   all right	he	conceded finally if you must know i don't get along with the	landlord.	7.851881967751936
10387. he keeps riding me because i like to listen to the radio	and sing while i'm taking a bath.	6.642773151705387
10388. he says the neighbors complain	but i don't believe it.	14.53194554011196
10389. why don't they tell me themselves if it	bothers them?	8.640676351528805
10390.    the man closed his eyes and nodded.	16.136316515150554
10391. when he	looked up again he seeemd almost contented.	9.055853309868477
10392. it will take a little time.	25.036904963861904
10393. i want to study your landlord's	habits and movements first.	10.992994112308635
10394. you see i always make it look like	an accident.	11.48832940527018
10395. maybe suicide if it looks reasonable.	9.102905270528913
10396. in that way there's	no trouble for the customer.	14.060671472259948
10397. customer?	15.610129252044759
10398.    pete smiled modestly.	14.873319658741169
10399. it's my	line of work he said h   five minutes later before haney	could make his break the stranger stood up and nodded farewell.	3.8096331697156143
10400. haney	watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently	and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure.	6.498807655264582
10401. phil decided to stay a little longer and as time passed	it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there but for	the other glass on the table.	5.449659368809648
10402. some time before midnight he returned	to his apartment and hit the sack putting the whole incident out of	mind before he fell asleep.	7.971095646797427
10403. the next day sunday the hangover	reminded haney where he had been the night before.	10.994448763969507
10404. the hangover	in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy and he	groaned.	9.643322200567408
10405. he went for more aspirin later in the day and passed the surly	landlord on the way- he was still alive and scowling as usual	as if tenants were a burden in his life.	6.1682294298234135
10406. phil shrugged and ignored him.	10.472119682746735
10407. he went back to work monday.	14.811805817129299
10408. by wednesday the landlord was	still alive.	11.788959499727591
10409. of course h on thursday haney mailed the monthly	check for separate maintenance to his wife lolly and wished the stranger	could do something about her h   coming home from work	he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment	building.	6.117930125909768
10410. inside the lobby people were standing around talking excitedly.	9.92718902319611
10411. his spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one	of his fellow tenants what had happened.	5.593433126427083
10412. late that afternoon it seemed he had fallen off the roof while	on some obscure errand or inspection.	6.742286821861181
10413. he had apparently been alone.	16.214412714951944
10414. nobody	witnessed the fall- just the sickening impact when his body smashed	on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance.	6.691830724209359
10415. haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor as he felt the	blood drain from his cheeks.	5.326519577128725
10416. he muttered something about how terrible	it was and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator.	8.26265427207832
10417. once	inside his apartment he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped	limply in a chair.	5.427950274147271
10418. after a while he began to feel better about	it especially when no one bothered to ask any questions.	9.361337398055829
10419. but after	all why should they?	12.754707820148809
10420.  still later he finally convinced himself	that it was an accident- just a coincidence.	8.746455801181735
10421. the stranger really	had nothing to do with it of course h   haney went to bed	happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord.	6.202845766727812
10422. after all the	man had no family so no one suffered and everybody was better off	for it.	8.681337776128059
10423. really he said to himself nobody kills a man just as a favor!	so you thought i didn't mean what i said.	5.4522052811283706
10424. the stranger's	eyes were large and sad as if phil haney had hurt his feelings.	8.086542342015262
10425. it was like a recurrent annoying dream but now the dream was	beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare.	8.698976925365663
10426. however haney	knew it was not a dream.	16.162314916690484
10427. he might be very tight but he knew where	he was.	10.964596607253961
10428. it was the same bar and it was two weeks later- saturday	night when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual.	11.573422862316912
10429. he	had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table as far as possible	from any talkative friendly lushes.	5.91871883499631
10430. he was enjoying the weekly	ritual of washing down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened	with water.	9.016975878454005
10431. this favorite grievance was not the landlord.	10.910513575229855
10432. he had	already quite forgotten about him.	13.671139498061125
10433. in fact he had only mentioned him	on the spur of the moment.	10.676262045250937
10434. his real grievance was lolly.	12.214555706636531
10435. toward	the end of his fourth hairy highball while he was moodily making	wet rings on the table-top with the bottom of the glass he became	aware that he was not alone.	6.444037218837682
10436. he looked up with bloodshot eyes and beheld	the stranger sitting across the table smiling a secret smile at him	as if they were fellow conspirators.	7.245762767568395
10437. he hadn't even noticed-	what was his name?	9.783357976961607
10438.  pete?	19.804021762487697
10439. - he hadn't seen him sit down.	4.642150625821065
10440. the man	was uncanny like a shadow and made as much noise as a shadow.	8.086542342015262
10441. haney felt like shrinking out of sight but he was already trapped	in the corner with the wiry dark little man.	0.0
10442. he began to wish that	he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through	the crossing.	9.702025602788266
10443. was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep	for a bar-buddy?	7.930102173568722
10444.  he'd have to start going to some of the other places	again.	10.588187671277922
10445. in a low voice almost whispering the man had asked	phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off	his back.	8.014814296585245
10446. he made the mistake of answering in an offhand way and instantly	realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice.	8.337200082911378
10447. pete frowned slightly then became sad and moody.	7.268549642882431
10448. haney	didn't want to encourage his company but felt he ought to buy him a	drink anyhow to prevent possible trouble.	6.74074628308523
10449. but there was no trouble.	34.50673952625305
10450. the guy sulked over his drink obviously upset by haney's lack of	appreciation.	9.0284140295764
10451. to break the uncomfortable silence haney began	to talk.	8.463364151644718
10452. in time and two drinks later he was complaining bitterly	about his wife he was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he	noticed the renewed interest in his listener- it showed in the alert	face and the suddenly bright eyes.	7.876311408596005
10453. when he paused to moisten	his throat the stranger broke in.	10.028893198027992
10454. but why pay her bills?	20.182527185765537
10455.  if she	runs around with other men and if you hate her as you say why not	just divorce her?	7.278945948699489
10456.    haney scowled.	15.594944937291627
10457. that bitch would love	a divorce he growled.	9.509783259141862
10458. then she'd get half of everything i	have.	11.185419424362621
10459. community property deal- you know.	9.619866555855914
10460. i'd have to sell out	my business to pay her off with her share.	5.846149303975244
10461. she can drop dead!	pete nodded understandingly.	11.821003819038125
10462. you must	understand i haven't been in this state too long.	10.781441329716351
10463. i came out here	to retire.	15.500336337628632
10464. that's why i- why i do a free job now and then.	4.747003294750034
10465. you	should have told me about her before.	7.14162538120728
10466. haney felt a twinge	of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again.	7.568039029815002
10467. then a wild	thought ran circles through his clouded brain.	8.193088844836073
10468. suppose- just suppose	this guy was really what he said he was! a retired professional killer	h if he was just a nut no harm was done.	7.45214725579004
10469. but if he was the	real thing he could do something about lolly.	12.211708388715605
10470. he felt very cunning	very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot.	10.615859602780361
10471. no offense intended he said gently.	9.570057002710861
10472. but it's just that-	well you know.	7.852334189897101
10473. the cops didn't suspect a thing and i thought	it was a coincidence.	6.817408452020724
10474. after all i didn't know you pete.	14.287468628095631
10475. it	could have been an accident.	9.546113479869389
10476. but if	you say you managed it h the stranger was hooked.	9.887008010130634
10477. yes yes he muttered impatiently.	10.334184435897878
10478. of course	it looked like an accident.	13.899042175769491
10479. i always work it that way- and always	at a time when the customer has an alibi.	7.758850631798414
10480. let me prove it phil.	17.03922172947959
10481. i	think i can manage one more favor for you.	7.187365013754166
10482. haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass.	10.109039551546998
10483. about halfway back pops groped against a wall and stopped pulled away	two loosely nailed wide boards at one end and went through.	5.603270927903557
10484. c'mon	he whispered; floor level's about three feet down so	don't fall.	7.879513779734377
10485. i went through and down into pitch darkness.	9.169644675936961
10486. he said	jist stay still.	17.83289566254582
10487. i'll pull the boards back and then get us	a light.	4.489674125097363
10488. jist stay where you are.	10.472119682746735
10489. i jist stayed where i was while	he fumbled around and then walked away.	7.033748404049442
10490. a moment later he struck a	match and lighted a candle and i could see.	7.88014969880378
10491. it was a big room	empty except for a few things of pop's at the far end- a wooden	crate on which stood the candle a spread out blanket and an unrolled	bindle.	7.245188310071653
10492. i looked back over my shoulder while i went to join him;	he'd hung another half of a blanket over the boarded window so no	light would show through.	7.275509611550843
10493. i took the pint bottle from my pocket	and handed it over as i sat down beside him on the spread blanket.	6.198322943593805
10494. he drank and handed it back.	14.544358862697363
10495. nice	place i told him.	9.118533821976325
10496. listen i got a buddy i travel with	real nice guy named larry.	7.947797872177788
10497. i know where he is right near here.	15.129210390056071
10498. could	he join the party and sleep here tonight too?	8.686942886564017
10499.  we'll both be blowing	town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you.	4.272790580033819
10500. he hesitated	a second looking at the bottle before he said sure-sure	and i reassured him.	9.002804282263241
10501. he'll bring a bottle too and i'll	get another one or maybe two while i'm out.	4.402201038136795
10502. you can work on this	one while i'm gone kill it if you want.	10.702801782734763
10503. i took a short swallow	from it myself and handed it to him.	8.124098364995595
10504. his sure-sure was	enthusiastic this time.	12.214555706636531
10505. he put the bottle down.	14.697534940976485
10506. git over by the window	while there's light an' i'll put th' candle out.	7.59535018803733
10507. when	yuh come back i'll put it out agin till you're both inside.	5.825820622377272
10508. charlie was waiting leaning against a building front.	8.581436094141479
10509. perfect	set-up i told him.	9.118533821976325
10510. but we got to go back to fifth and get	another bottle or two.	11.832757202944913
10511. on the way i'll give you the scoop.	15.126754286699835
10512. on the way i gave him the scoop.	26.063700498619408
10513. i bought another pint of sherry	and when we got back pops let us in in the dark put back the blanket	and then lighted the candle again.	5.9966546970025325
10514. i introduced my friend larry	to pops and we made ourselves comfortable.	9.713745980661573
10515. there was still a little	not much left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and	killed it and charlie opened his.	8.625010068210852
10516. i was reminded amusedly	by a poem of kenneth patchen's called the murder of two men	by a young kid wearing lemon colored gloves which patchen himself	read on a record against jazz background.	7.134682597928682
10517. the poem consisted of	only two words the word wait repeated over and over at irregular	intervals and with different inflections and then the word now!	and a blaring final chord from the jazz group.	5.606677678796274
10518. this was	the same except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither	of us was wearing gloves.	11.01515914480251
10519. but we could wait all right; there	was no hurry.	11.25361757827344
10520. i said wait h wait to charlie and he grinned	digging the reference.	9.285570187987327
10521. we'd heard the record together once.	6.710151112086783
10522. the second bottle passed a few times.	13.06263632702246
10523. pop was taking long ones but	not showing the effect yet.	6.210871206873012
10524. he seemed as drunk as when i'd first	talked to him but no drunker.	10.21550409562075
10525. he had a capacity; if we'd really	been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more	wine.	8.946748489297391
10526. about halfway through the second bottle charlie looked	at me across pops who was sitting between us and asked now?	7.01976550281841
10527. 	i said wait and handed the bottle to pops for his final	drink.	5.825820622377272
10528. when he handed it back and i had hold of it safely pops was	looking toward me and i said now to charlie and he swung	the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket	once.	6.92354111842378
10529. it was a lead pipe cinch.	19.958795528615465
10530. there was a sound like the one	you produce by flicking a watermelon with your finger only louder	and pops fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise.	8.559715532691726
10531. out cold	if not dead; and he'd never known what hit him- he'd never	known that anything had hit him.	6.387127952101957
10532. i reached my hand toward	him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a heartbeat but charlie	said wait!- and said it sharply not as in the patchen bit	but as an order- so i stopped my hand and looked at him.	6.793053782611969
10533. he was	holding the piece of lead pipe out to me.	7.953394054598466
10534. we don't want to	know whether he's dead yet.	7.563239437115806
10535. i gauged that blow to be borderline.	9.95288923829895
10536. to kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill.	10.079693388337176
10537. you hit again about twice	that hard before we know whether he's dead or not.	7.073823370696189
10538. that way we'll	never know which of us really killed him and which was just the accomplice.	9.838039515886702
10539. dig?	15.610129252044759
10540.    i dug him i saw his point; it made sense.	10.227318669010717
10541. i took the piece of pipe from charlie's hand and used it harder	than he had.	6.950729068539884
10542. the thunk was louder anyway and i thought i heard	bone crack.	9.921153990887353
10543. that did it if mine	didn't.	11.713854418644907
10544. and we'll never know which.	14.541342074437404
10545. all right now i'll give	you a hand.	8.961969194380144
10546. we straightened pops up and i made sure there	was no trace of a heartbeat.	8.497743810732977
10547. let's	put him down again the way he was.	7.302928851907084
10548. it's a more natural position.	2.4895117825465722
10549. how do you feel?	17.058897260570216
10550.  charlie asked me.	13.148092146312546
10551. what do you feel?	25.38840841655893
10552.    nothing.	19.804021762487697
10553. well h maybe i'm exaggerating.	10.59633742259972
10554. it was a kick but not	a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again except for	stakes.	11.119930901565123
10555. but let's not talk about it abstractly until we're out of	here.	7.793238909001978
10556. now first question: the bottles.	13.476598103985157
10557. shall we take them all with	us or leave one?	6.636666065131321
10558.    take them i said.	14.547058520014232
10559. if we	left one we'd have to wipe it for fingerprints.	8.316587089358201
10560. here's the picture	we want to leave for the fuzz- whenever the body gets found.	5.900854572412973
10561. this	happened in the middle of a drinking bout with another bum.	9.598187607030894
10562. if they'd	been working on a bottle or a jug he'd have taken it with him.	9.29164091385634
10563. and he'd have taken the weapon with him too so	we take that.	7.411667773880849
10564. i've been careful	about fingerprints.	5.619779380086188
10565. there are	the boards over the window of course but they're not painted and too	rough to take prints.	7.0758606955518335
10566. same goes for the rough cement of the ledge.	8.196044167676531
10567. besides i doubt if the cops will even try dusting.	7.36155552517143
10568. they find dead	winos every day maybe they won't even autopsy him for the cause of	death.	8.284985380647505
10569. we can't take a chance on that.	6.377326113887548
10570. we've got to	assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the	picture consistent.	5.746732924089678
10571. our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have	turned out his pockets.	6.270394613191037
10572. we did that and found	a dirty handkerchief some matches and fourteen cents in change.	9.62584488426135
10573. we	took the matches- they were book matches and once they'd been touched	might retain fingerprints- and the change.	5.236383152695367
10574. we discussed	the candle and decided the hypothetical other bum would have left it	burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reason	to blow it out.	7.516103490177819
10575. the candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't	set fire to the crate when it guttered out.	5.792716478870052
10576. a fire wouldn't have	mattered except that it would cause pops to be found sooner.	11.618282574135279
10577. he	might not be found for days even weeks otherwise.	6.460370037324521
10578. we went once	more over every point then triple-checked.	11.399541947434118
10579. being picked up for questioning	by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining	danger and we weren't picked up by a cop.	7.26283185086176
10580. in fact nobody saw	us cop or citizen.	16.02767527308239
10581. winsett is a quiet street with no taverns and was	completely deserted at that hour.	5.946164924123117
10582. which if it matters was one am.	11.744554566091274
10583. less than three hours ago we'd decided in maxine wells's	pad on cosmo to commit a trial murder.	6.364962735301224
10584. it had gone like clockwork.	25.82858759257853
10585. almost too smoothly i found myself thinking and then told	myself that was ridiculous.	6.612703502166117
10586. how safe is too safe?	13.921012568448406
10587.  thinking like that	can get you into a padded pad.	6.460370037324521
10588. an hour later we were back	in my unpadded pad killing what had been left of the second pint.	9.22979475253257
10589. we	decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow.	7.475480301730271
10590. also our plans for	me to commit charlie's murder and for him to commit mine.	8.52216100130935
10591. but we	were really going to do it.	15.31092165032838
10592. we shook hands on it.	15.292242212242115
10593. we planned	ahead only one step a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap notes.	6.6981788258569415
10594. i'd tell him everything i'd learned about seaton's habits	and habitat and he'd tell me the score on radic.	5.4921307270326984
10595. we made the date	for two o'clock in the afternoon at maxine wells's pad.	7.527108699739346
10596. charlie	would get there early because he had the key.	11.005819625419974
10597. from here on in the	less charlie and i were seen together in public or visited one another's	rooms the better.	6.022223999077327
10598. i was dead tired and slept soundly	as far as i know dreamlessly.	12.747872201093443
10599. we met at maxine's and decided	we were set to stay as long as it took into or even through the	evening to talk things out.	5.934629797301404
10600. charlie had brought food and we'd decided	on no drinks.	8.196044167676531
10601. i'd brought along the virgin pint from last night	but we were going to kill that only when we were through talking.	4.9039274077800865
10602. i talked first telling him everything i knew about seaton and	his house and domestic arrangements.	8.345247830725647
10603. i drew diagrams and floor plans;	he memorized them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces	and flushed them down.	6.082556929924355
10604. he gave me equivalent and even more detailed	dope on radic including diagrams- one of the apartment building	radic lived in and one of the apartment itself.	9.955000727586274
10605. he'd been there several	times back when while he and radic had been friends or at least	not enemies.	5.236383152695367
10606. it didn't take us as long as we'd thought	it might; it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and charlie	said well i guess that's it.	7.0712764649340505
10607. shall we flip a coin to see	which of us goes first?	6.144150771473031
10608.  or would you rather deal a hand of show-down	poker or play a game of gin rummy or what?	7.391149566124332
10609.    wait a	minute charlie i said.	8.254441635698543
10610. one thing we haven't discussed expense	money.	17.591171375084503
10611. we'll need some at least if only bus fare to the	scene of the crime.	4.240163322596448
10612. and if you're as flat broke as i am i think	we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station	or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while	the other does his dirty work.	8.35454531847783
10613. all right i'll	come clean.	12.459734490734041
10614. i've got a little stashed for a rainy day and i	guess this is rainy enough.	5.442531252584684
10615. if you draw the short	straw i'll lend you some bread like fifty bucks before i take	off to visit my sister in frisco.	6.525936975929947
10616. then after i'm back another	fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi	somewhere while i take care of your seat cover boy.	8.782032775401019
10617. i took a deep breath and the plunge.	9.169644675936961
10618. in that case	let's not draw.	20.228455055719962
10619. i'll go to bat first.	4.98254549585643
10620. you'd have to wait till seaton's	back from mexico city and also while i set it up with doris	to have her have an alibi for d-night.	6.315080921832862
10621. so it wouldn't be	for days or even a week before you could do anything.	7.483173170844182
10622. but your friend	manny can go any time.	12.934994931595257
10623. he grinned and clapped me on the shoulder.	11.189339384863365
10624. i was hoping you'd say that willy.	14.894590857967684
10625. but i wouldn't	have suggested it.	16.84389310610293
10626. well- in that case i take off tomorrow morning	for frisco.	7.879513779734377
10627. and in case i brought the money with me.	10.156773605060762
10628. now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer	to his brothers merge without let.	9.237963749856066
10629. self's integrity was and	is and ever had been.	6.764147616291221
10630. mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves	the many threes-fulfilled on mars corporate and discorporate the precious	few on earth- the unknown powers of three on earth that would	be his to merge with and cherish now that at last long waiting he	grokked and cherished himself.	5.482669510571224
10631. mike remained in trance; there	was much to grok loose ends to puzzle over and fit into his growing-	all that he had seen and heard and been at the archangel foster	tabernacle	h why bishop senator boone made him warily uneasy how miss	dawn ardent tasted like a water brother when she was not the smell	of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping up and down and	wailing-   jubal's conversations coming and going- jubal's	words troubled him most; he studied them compared them with what	he had been taught as a nestling struggling to bridge between languages	the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in.	4.454925916010261
10632. the word church which turned up over and over again among jubal's	words gave him knotty difficulty; there was no martian concept	to match it- unless one took church and worship and	god and congregation and many other words and equated them	to the totality of the only world he had known during growing-waiting	h then forced the concept back into english in that phrase which	had been rejected by jubal by mahmoud by digby.	6.03300961000493
10633. he was closer to understanding	it in english now although it could never have the inevitability of	the martian concept it stood for.	6.244951219500418
10634. in his mind he spoke simultaneously	the english sentence and the martian word and felt closer grokking.	9.882896131012437
10635. repeating it like a student telling himself that the jewel is in the	lotus he sank into nirvana.	5.236383152695367
10636. before midnight he speeded his	heart resumed normal breathing ran down his check list uncurled and	sat up.	7.639312262253327
10637. he had been weary; now he felt light and gay and clear-headed	ready for the many actions he saw spreading out before him.	6.794244789921382
10638. he felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity	for quiet.	9.908904935333027
10639. he stepped out into the hall was delighted to encounter	a water brother.	9.21486800923784
10640. my	you look chipper.	13.148092146312546
10641. i feel fine! where is everybody?	12.499679017771939
10642. 	asleep.	19.804021762487697
10643. ben and stinky went home an hour ago and people	started going to bed.	5.674295354649883
10644. mike felt disappointed	that mahmoud had left; he wanted to explain his new grokking.	8.23599424518072
10645. i ought to be asleep too but i felt like a snack.	8.970932134155579
10646. are you hungry?	28.260706101627743
10647. 	sure i'm hungry!   come on there's	some cold chicken and we'll see what else.	5.674295354649883
10648. they went downstairs	loaded a tray lavishly.	15.455953350789537
10649. it's	plenty warm.	12.292407525564322
10650. a fine idea mike agreed.	13.150214475214955
10651. warm	enough to swim- real indian summer.	7.622507342753323
10652. i'll switch on the floods.	6.321180167012423
10653. i'll carry the	tray.	5.415523385813093
10654. he could see in almost total darkness.	16.057423410908584
10655. jubal said that his	night-sight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown	up and mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to	it; his foster parents had taught him to see.	5.572823351434084
10656. as for the night being	warm he would have been comfortable naked on mount everest but	his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and	pressure; he was considerate of their weakness once he learned of	it.	7.871937346372747
10657. but he was looking forward to snow- seeing for himself that each	tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual as he had	read- walking barefoot rolling in it.	6.555685006744985
10658. in the meantime he was	pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of	his water brother.	9.509851941930114
10659. i'll switch on	the underwater lights.	4.98254549585643
10660. that'll be plenty to eat by.	9.670406878971576
10661. mike liked having light up through the ripples; it was a goodness	beauty.	7.267122619102895
10662. they picnicked by the pool then lay back on the grass	and looked at stars.	9.730990650855384
10663. it is mars	isn't it?	27.114282721940036
10664.  or antares?	21.155649925121566
10665.    it is mars.	36.00803266626256
10666. mike?	19.804021762487697
10667. 	what are they doing on mars?	7.622507342753323
10668.    he hesitated;	the question was too wide for the sparse english language.	9.592132658614503
10669. on the	side toward the horizon- the southern hemisphere- it is spring;	plants are being taught to grow.	6.393932997153159
10670. 'taught to grow'?	13.148092146312546
10671. 	he hesitated.	12.292407525564322
10672. larry teaches plants to grow.	10.472119682746735
10673. but my people- martians i mean; i now grok you	are my people- teach plants another way.	6.478669021782826
10674. in the other hemisphere	it is growing colder and nymphs those who stayed alive through the	summer	are being brought into nests for quickening and more growing.	8.178782410630626
10675. of the humans we left at the equator one has discorporated	and the others are sad.	7.814769178457865
10676. yes i heard it in the news.	13.26959208979501
10677. mike had not heard it; he had not known it until asked.	6.323833855253015
10678. they should not be sad.	25.794544051780168
10679. mr booker t w jones food technician	first class is not sad; the old ones have cherished him.	5.899583550538197
10680. he had his own face	dark and beautiful.	17.062674567850294
10681. oh dear!	mike h do you ever get homesick?	7.674607905193737
10682.  for mars?	26.043761833710224
10683.    at	first i was homesick he answered.	7.738906147426005
10684. he	rolled toward her and took her in his arms.	8.196044167676531
10685. but now i am not lonely.	15.343289009395573
10686. i grok i shall never be lonely again.	11.901001831990433
10687. mike darling-	they kissed and went on kissing.	7.14162538120728
10688. presently his water	brother said breathlessly.	12.778969895512995
10689. oh my! that was almost worse than	the first time.	7.259083843395202
10690. you are all right my brother?	17.799652589239614
10691. 	yes.	15.610129252044759
10692. a long time later	by cosmic clock she said mike?	14.462381231847532
10693.  is that- i mean 'do	you know'-   i know.	8.819386396683496
10694. it is for growing closer.	34.101075985686876
10695. well h i've been ready a long time-	goodness we all have but h never mind dear; turn just a little.	5.510318087248114
10696. as they merged grokking together mike	said softly and triumphantly: thou art god.	9.825365907322965
10697. her answer	was not in words.	9.707775903539014
10698. then as their grokking made them ever closer	and mike felt himself almost ready to discorporate her voice called	him back: oh! h oh! thou art god!   we	grok god.	6.412522996181235
10699. on mars humans were building pressure	domes for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship.	6.482950835391445
10700. this	went faster than scheduled as the martians were helpful.	8.196044167676531
10701. part of	the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a long-distance	plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of mars to make the planet more	friendly to future human generations.	5.837069178973483
10702. the old ones neither	helped nor hindered this plan; time was not yet.	9.814261381964235
10703. their meditations	were approaching a violent cusp that would shape martian art for	many millennia.	6.0499009441942295
10704. on earth elections continued and a very advanced poet	published a limited edition of verse consisting entirely of punctuation	marks and spaces; time magazine reviewed it and suggested that	the federation assembly daily record should be translated into	the medium.	6.295968853380908
10705. a colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs	of plants and mrs joseph douglas	was quoted as saying: i would no more sit down without flowers	on my table than without serviettes.	4.906150919746423
10706. a tibetan swami from palermo	sicily announced in beverly hills a newly discovered ancient	yoga discipline for ripple breathing which increased both pranha and	cosmic attraction between sexes.	6.975146640763646
10707. his chelas were required to assume	the	matsyendra posture dressed in hand-woven diapers while he read aloud	from rig-veda and an assistant guru examined their purses in another	room- nothing was stolen; the purpose was less immediate.	4.810457141890152
10708. the president of the united states proclaimed the first sunday	in november as national grandmothers' day and urged america	to say it with flowers.	11.519204592431944
10709. a funeral parlor chain was indicted for price-cutting.	8.023923068000494
10710. fosterite bishops after secret conclave announced the	church's second major miracle: supreme bishop digby had been	translated bodily to heaven and spot-promoted to archangel ranking	with-but-after archangel foster.	6.046219493410928
10711. the glorious news had been held up	pending heavenly confirmation of the elevation of a new supreme bishop	huey short- a candidate accepted by the boone faction after	lots had been cast repeatedly.	5.3116668516122525
10712. l'unita and hoy published	identical denunciations of short's elevation l'osservatore	romano and the christian science monitor ignored it	times of india snickered at it and the manchester guardian	simply reported it- the fosterites in england were few but extremely	militant.	5.8091401848612625
10713. digby was not pleased with his promotion.	7.14162538120728
10714. the	man from mars had interrupted him with his work half finished- and	that stupid jackass short was certain to louse it up.	6.328375638842273
10715. foster listened	with angelic patience until digby ran down then said listen	junior you're an angel now- so forget it.	5.15576524365156
10716. eternity is no time for	recriminations.	10.472119682746735
10717. you too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me.	8.498258318368384
10718. afterwards you did well enough.	10.472119682746735
10719. now that short is supreme bishop	he'll do all right he can't help it.	7.381131313890214
10720. same as with the popes.	12.904760905460407
10721. some of them were warts until they got promoted.	14.894614155375903
10722. check with one of	them go ahead- there's no professional jealousy here.	8.597539841999144
10723. digby calmed down but made one request.	7.14162538120728
10724. you can't touch him.	10.132095952869534
10725. you shouldn't have tried to.	13.44371259307425
10726. oh you	can submit a requisition for a miracle if you want to make a fool of	yourself.	10.583134193036019
10727. but i'm telling you it'll be turned down- you don't	understand the system yet.	7.144332561680589
10728. the martians have their own setup different	from ours and as long as they need him we can't touch him.	9.398668714714095
10729. they run their show their way- the universe has variety something	for everybody- a fact you field workers often miss.	5.806893583481489
10730. you	mean this punk can brush me aside and i've got to hold still for	it?	7.032105024464237
10731.    i held still for the same thing didn't i?	12.398026735304922
10732. 	i'm helping you now am i not?	9.060328853487057
10733.  now look there's work to be	done and lots of it.	7.779335544175993
10734. the boss wants performance not gripes.	12.435529358277208
10735. if you	need a day off to calm down duck over to the muslim paradise and	take it.	7.61185968612517
10736. otherwise straighten your halo square your wings and dig	in.	9.293162213147937
10737. the sooner you act like an angel the quicker you'll feel angelic.	6.817408452020724
10738. get happy junior!   digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh.	9.228466373617696
10739. where do i start?	13.779044544304579
10740.    jubal did	not hear of digby's disappearance when it was announced and when	he did while he had a fleeting suspicion he dismissed it; if mike	had had a finger in it he had gotten away with it- and what happened	to supreme bishops worried jubal not at all as long as he wasn't	bothered.	7.187436000435433
10741. his household had gone through an upset.	8.100034263261762
10742. jubal deduced	what had happened but did not know with whom- and didn't want	to inquire.	7.7863138642745255
10743. mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself	in the clinches.	5.674295354649883
10744. anyhow it was high time the boy was salted.	9.32077175195465
10745. jubal couldn't reconstruct the crime from the way the girls behaved	because patterns kept shifting- abc vs d then bcd	vs a h or ab vs cd or ad	vs	cb through all ways that four women can gang up on each	other.	5.007799260061334
10746. this continued most of the week following that ill-starred	trip to church during which period mike stayed in his room and usually	in a trance so deep that jubal would have pronounced him dead	had he not seen it before.	6.8415633708662975
10747. jubal would not have minded it if service	had not gone to pieces.	6.8487660326918665
10748. the girls seemed to spend half their time tiptoeing	in to see if mike was all right and they were too preoccupied	to cook much less be secretaries.	8.172984359896788
10749. even rock-steady anne- hell	anne was the worst! absent-minded subject to unexplained tears	h jubal would have bet his life that if anne were to witness the	second coming she would memorize date time personae events and	barometric pressure without batting her calm blue eyes.	4.654404053973777
10750. the expense and time involved are astronomical.	15.37373384855785
10751. however we sent a third	vessel out a much smaller and faster one than the first two.	6.906128545742077
10752. we	have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago;	that is all i can tell you about them.	6.875298304288526
10753. but the third ship	came back several years ago and reported h   that it	had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already	inhabited by sentient beings! said hal forgetting in his enthusiasm	that he had not been asked to speak.	5.958104489456173
10754. macneff stopped	pacing to stare at hal with his pale blue eyes.	7.615092762846159
10755. how did you	know?	19.254026956884726
10756.  he said sharply.	35.485283191076476
10757. forgive me sandalphon	said hal.	9.118533821976325
10758. but it was inevitable! did not the forerunner predict	in his time and the world line that such a planet would be found?	11.430141241607075
10759. 	i believe it was on page 573!   macneff smiled and	said i am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression.	5.418854009719454
10760. how could they not?	20.754207695001554
10761.  thought hal.	12.292407525564322
10762. besides they	were not the only impressions.	13.290152026153214
10763. i still bear scars on my back where	pornsen my gapt whipped me because i had not learned my lessons	well enough.	6.079890685916713
10764. he was a good impresser that pornsen.	20.671395827884076
10765. was?	15.610129252044759
10766.  is!	as i	grew older and was promoted so was he always where i was.	7.198778874655976
10767. he was	my gapt in the creche.	10.776005861178222
10768. he was the dormitory gapt when i went	to college and thought i was getting away from him.	9.57308635264569
10769. he is now my block	gapt.	19.67510719041467
10770. he is the one responsible for my getting such low m	r's.	15.79575104286616
10771. swiftly came the revulsion the protest.	7.622507342753323
10772. no not	he for i and i alone am responsible for whatever happens to me.	7.979643700582811
10773. if i get a low m r i do so because i want it that way or	my dark self does.	6.585818007077786
10774. if i die i die because i willed it so.	12.781233928239018
10775. so forgive	me sigmen for the contrary-to-reality thoughts!   please	pardon me again sandalphon said hal.	6.566375660587496
10776. but did the expedition	find any records of the forerunner having been on this planet?	8.741314683746015
10777. 	perhaps even though this is too much to wish find the forerunner	himself?	7.594643982287583
10778.    no said macneff.	19.760916551105623
10779. though that does	not mean that there may not be such records there.	7.564520033479743
10780. the expedition	was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return	to earth.	9.153824850745861
10781. i can't tell you now the distance in lightyears or what	star this was though you can see it with the naked eye at night in	this hemisphere.	4.969723932498112
10782. if you volunteer you will be told where you're going	after the ship leaves.	12.44786035053452
10783. and it leaves very soon.	16.876262121443325
10784. you	need a linguist?	13.148092146312546
10785.  said hal.	17.401135049171184
10786. the ship is huge said	macneff but the number of military men and specialists we are taking	limits the linguists to one.	8.947529095868312
10787. we have considered several of your	professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion.	8.03948294732158
10788. unfortunately	h   hal waited: macneff paced some more frowning.	8.581436094141479
10789. then he said unfortunately only one lamechian linguist	exists and he is too old for this expedition.	7.992885081129845
10790. therefore h	a thousand pardons said hal.	10.736049194446608
10791. but i have just thought	of one thing.	18.29819550328225
10792. no problem at all	said macneff.	13.484377447423066
10793. there will be no women aboard the gabriel.	19.494498604946124
10794. and	if a man is married he will automatically be given a divorce.	9.358154751973185
10795. hal gasped and he said a divorce?	10.001807622962554
10796.    macneff raised	his hands apologetically and said you are horrified of course.	7.615092762846159
10797. but from our reading of the western talmud we urielites	believe that the forerunner knowing this situation would arise made	reference to and provision for divorce.	6.8197853079348665
10798. it's inevitable in this case	for the couple will be separated for at the least forty years.	4.447768971936297
10799. naturally	he couched the provision in obscure language.	7.14162538120728
10800. in his great	and glorious wisdom he knew that our enemies the israelites must not	be able to read therein what we planned.	8.710909315912243
10801. tell me more sandalphon.	9.588202614397494
10802. six months later	hal yarrow stood in the observation dome of the gabriel and	watched the ball of earth dwindle above him.	7.145164081717731
10803. it was night on this hemisphere	but the light blazed from the megalopolises of australia	japan china southeast asia india siberia.	7.16567459221874
10804. hal the linguist	saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken	therein.	8.886042952771371
10805. australia the philippine islands japan and northern	china were inhabited by those members of the haijac union that spoke	american.	5.7271862127835895
10806. southern china all of southeast asia southern	india and ceylon these states of the malay federation spoke bazaar.	6.904123578213819
10807. his mind turned the globe	swiftly for him and he visualized africa which used swahili south	of the sahara sea.	6.615385214502506
10808. all around the mediterranean sea asia minor	northern india and tibet hebrew was the native tongue.	7.853634057958918
10809. in	southern europe between the israeli republics and the icelandic-speaking	peoples of northern europe was a thin but long stretch of territory	called march.	4.958070100322966
10810. this was no man's land disputed by the haijac	union and the israeli republic a potential source of war for	the last two hundred years.	7.6411475967317
10811. neither nation would give up their claim	on it yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second	apocalyptic war.	6.322589208182508
10812. so for all practical purposes it was an independent	nation and by now had its own organized government	.	9.297560076463489
10813. its citizens spoke all of the world's surviving	tongues plus a new one called lingo a pidgin whose vocabulary	was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could	be contained on half a sheet of paper.	4.81109560617958
10814. hal saw in his mind	the rest of earth: iceland greenland the caribbean islands	and the eastern half of south america.	6.44893033609597
10815. here the peoples spoke the tongue	of iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the hawaiian-americans	who were busy resettling north america and the western	half of south america after the apocalyptic war.	5.77612605009306
10816. then	there was north america where american was the native speech of all	except the twenty descendants of french-canadians living on the hudson	bay preserve.	6.221143152558621
10817. hal knew that when that side of earth	rotated into the night zone sigmen city would blaze out into space.	5.083242045036259
10818. and somewhere in that enormous light was his apartment.	10.287421266955633
10819. but mary	would soon no longer be living there for she would be notified in a	few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to	tahiti.	5.599908064302229
10820. she would weep in private he was sure for she loved him	in her frigid way though in public she would be dry-eyed.	7.383559575995673
10821. her friends	and professional associates would sympathize with her not because she	had lost a beloved husband but because she had been married to a man	who thought unrealistically.	5.202300107616343
10822. if hal yarrow had been killed in a	crash he must have wanted it that way.	9.216615257228089
10823. there was no such thing as an	accident.	31.51399156488887
10824. somehow all the other passengers	have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance	had simultaneously agreed	to die.	7.399997117206211
10825. and therefore being in disgrace they would not be cremated	and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony.	6.63161347574479
10826. no the fish	could eat their bodies for all the sturch cared.	10.049405630952123
10827. hal felt	sorry for mary; he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his	own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome.	5.571891459712226
10828. yet	he told himself this was the best way.	11.45981022323534
10829. he and mary would no longer	have to tear and rend at each other; their mutual torture would be	over.	6.585403889684707
10830. mary was free to marry again not knowing that the sturch had	secretly given her a divorce thinking that death had dissolved her	marriage.	6.717792787651652
10831. she would have a year in which to make up her mind to choose	a mate from a list selected by her gapt.	7.356479223090401
10832. perhaps the psychological	barriers that had prevented her from conceiving hal's child would	no longer be present.	8.645068462809599
10833. hal doubted if this happy event	would occur.	7.14162538120728
10834. mary was as frozen below the navel as he.	8.892172105014772
10835. no matter who	the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt h   the	gapt.	9.010102772692655
10836. he would no longer have to see that fat face hear	that whining voice h   hal yarrow! said the whining	voice.	10.004458941426464
10837. and slowly feeling himself icy yet burning hal turned.	8.108856755126041
10838. there was the squat loose-jowled man smiling lopsidedly	up at him.	16.83937934090461
10839. my beloved ward my perennial gadfly said the	whining voice.	7.095994055561842
10840. i had no idea that you too would be on this glorious	voyage.	11.005023618795416
10841. but i might have known! we seem to be bound by love;	sigmen himself must have foreseen it.	8.22349001756726
10842. love to you my ward.	10.983477020546593
10843. sigmen love you too my guardian said hal choking.	6.460370037324521
10844. how	wonderful to see your cherished self.	9.670406878971576
10845. i had thought we would never	again speak to each other.	9.323688320053892
10846. the gabriel pointed	towards her destination and under one-gee acceleration began to build	up towards her ultimate velocity 99.	7.48837548295765
10847. 1 percent of the speed of light.	12.21476784965131
10848. meanwhile all the personnel except those few needed to carry out	the performance of the ship went into the suspensor.	7.2824623277407525
10849. here they would	lie in suspended animation for many years.	9.541021300868657
10850. some time later after	a check had been made of all automatic equipment the crew would join	the others.	9.952496417846513
10851. they would sleep while the gabriel's drive would increase	the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel	could not have endured.	6.463467907489391
10852. upon reaching the desired speed the	automatic equipment would cut off the drive and the silent but not empty	vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journey's end.	6.350370199731661
10853. many years later the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of	the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration.	6.345892447065436
10854. again a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure	would be applied.	8.363747787044698
10855. then after slowing the vessel considerably the drive	would adjust to a one-gee deceleration.	6.679996801724873
10856. and the crew would be automatically	brought out of their suspended animation.	11.407704029517989
10857. these members would	then unthaw the rest of the personnel.	10.78959546031297
10858. and in the half-year left	before reaching their destination the men would carry out whatever	preparations were needed.	10.125848877460767
10859. hal yarrow was among the last to go	into the suspensor and among the first to come out.	6.6133398397231105
10860. he had to study	the recordings of the language of the chief nation of ozagen siddo.	13.174267852371106
10861. and from the first he faced a difficult task.	11.4822246633842
10862. the expedition that	had discovered ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand siddo	words with an equal number of american words.	7.89731643363319
10863. the description of	the siddo syntax was very restricted.	8.341215694113531
10864. and as hal found out obviously	mistaken in many cases.	12.33523252385319
10865. this discovery caused hal anxiety.	11.309843967689007
10866. his duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel	of the gabriel how to speak ozagen.	8.10870657293274
10867. yet if he used all of the	little means at his disposal he would be instructing his students	wrongly.	6.623002916648006
10868. moreover even getting this across would be difficult.	10.514280166105873
10869. for one thing the organs of speech of the ozagen natives differed	somewhat from earthmen's; the sounds made by these organs were	therefore dissimilar.	7.246196728979406
10870. it was true that they could be approximated	but would the ozagenians understand these approximations?	13.513578749536904
10871.    another	obstacle was the grammatical construction of siddo.	7.14162538120728
10872. instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached	particle to indicate the past or future siddo used an entirely different	word.	8.97061060664233
10873. thus the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai	meaning to live was in the perfect tense ksu'u'peli'afo	and in the future mai'teipa.	7.490544664083626
10874. the same use of	an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses.	11.74086542457542
10875. plus the	fact that siddo not only had the normal three genders	of masculine feminine and neuter but the two extra of inanimate and	spiritual.	4.903693293796623
10876. fortunately gender was inflected though the expression	of it would be difficult for anybody not born in siddo.	7.738106859483177
10877. the system	of indicating gender varied according to tense.	8.341215694113531
10878. all the other	parts of speech: nouns pronouns adjectives adverbs and conjunctions	operated under the same system as the verbs.	7.98292226510367
10879. this was not for the angel just a matter of running through a logical	or deductive chain or deciding on some action from some already	established premise.	6.783491024342418
10880. no doubt the angels could do that kind of thing	as fast as any computer.	11.113688151867496
10881. what gabriel was being asked to do	now however was to re-examine all his basic assumptions make value-judgments	on them and give them new and different powers in his mind	to govern his motives.	5.139461289280905
10882. this is not wholly a reasoning process- a computer	cannot do it all- and even in an angel it takes time.	10.850633196868232
10883. perhaps especially in an angel whose assumptions had mostly been	being reasonably sure of the	reason for the long pause however did not make it seem any less long	to jack.	5.623452495899517
10884. he had already become used to hesperus' snapping back answers	to questions almost before jack could get them asked.	8.725284242937896
10885. there	was nothing he could do but wait.	8.923219809040408
10886. at	last gabriel spoke.	13.148092146312546
10887. we misjudged you he said slowly.	10.717432709549398
10888. we had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had	time to develop a sense of justice.	9.411182198381992
10889. of course we have before us the	example of the great races at the galactic center; individually they	are nearly as mortal as you- the difference does not seem very marked	to us where it exists.	5.808033151720827
10890. but they have survived for long periods as	races whereas you are young.	12.35026672032372
10891. we shall recommend to them that	they shorten your trial period by half.	7.970495892540978
10892. for now it is clear	that we were in the wrong.	12.372623381612586
10893. you may reclaim your property and the	penalty on hesperus is lifted.	9.242266870568722
10894. i	did not perceive this essential distinction either first-born	hesperus said at once i was only practicing a concept that jack	taught me called a deal.	6.602504042024367
10895. nevertheless you were its	agent.	11.11483049001212
10896. jack what is the nature of this concept?	13.86513856163982
10897.    it's	a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other	jack said.	5.542917982132687
10898. we regard it as fair only when each party feels	that what he has received is as valuable or more valuable than what	he has given.	6.889256769405176
10899. his heart he discovered was pounding.	9.235400264666348
10900. for	instance hesperus agreed to help me find my property and i agreed	to take him to earth.	7.513561455654996
10901. between individuals this process is called	bargaining.	10.075132092453119
10902. when it is done between races or nations it is called	making a treaty.	12.247404281143323
10903. and the major part of my mission to your nest is to	make a treaty between your race and mine.	7.484009081100845
10904. recovering the property was	much less important.	9.670406878971576
10905. and	apparently impossible.	12.292407525564322
10906. though it might be that we would have much to	give you you have nothing to give us.	11.094116013052464
10907. hesperus and lucifer	jack said show that we do.	6.764147616291221
10908. another pause;	but this one was not nearly as long.	10.904068427512161
10909. then it is a matter of	pleasure; of curiosity; of a more alive time.	14.373985640214492
10910. yes those could	be commodities under this concept.	10.889027716785424
10911. but you should understand jack	that hesperus and lucifer are not long out of the nursery.	8.283635008922003
10912. visiting	the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older.	10.78831962583174
10913. this explained a great deal.	11.309843967689007
10914. all the more reason	then jack said why we must have a treaty.	14.397144668987599
10915. we will gladly entertain	your young and give them proper living quarters in return for	their help in running our fusion reactors.	6.558752098367788
10916. but we must know if this	is in accordance with your customs and must have your agreement they	will not misuse the power we put in their hands to our hurt.	7.953229150945037
10917. but this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the	dictates of their own natures and respect yours in turn.	7.717408201811601
10918. to this	we	of course agree.	16.190745095301136
10919. jack felt a wave of complete elation but	in a second it had vanished without a trace.	5.8816751717433835
10920. what gabriel was asking	was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments and contract	to let the angels serve on earth as it is in heaven regardless	of the applicable earth laws.	7.601954052211928
10921. the angels in turn would exercise	similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures	of the earthmen- but they had no faintest notion of man's perverse	habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own	preferences and violations of his nature.	5.045119849433976
10922. the simple treaty principle	that gabriel was asking him to ratify in short was nothing	less than total trust.	8.901660027869564
10923. and it might	be considering the uncomfortable custom the angels had of thinking	of everything in terms of absolutes that the proposal of anything less	might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war.	5.854493217679945
10924. furthermore even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of	jack's total make-up could not understand how the principle could	ever be codified.	6.921684858431951
10925. almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward	suspicion not trust as the safest and sanest attitude toward all	outsiders.	5.629028301924947
10926. yet there was some precedent for it.	14.319941035478317
10927. the history of	disarmament agreements for instance had been unreassuringly dismal;	but the united states and the union of soviet socialist republics	nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban and	a sort of provisional acceptance of each other's good intentions on	this limited question.	6.002904610295051
10928. out of that agreement though not by any easy	road eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the united nations;	suspicion between member states still existed but it was of	about the same low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry	between arizona and california over water supplies.	7.427094716615564
10929. besides	agreements in principle with the petty details to be thrashed	out later were commonplace in diplomatic history.	5.326519577128725
10930. the trouble with	them was that they almost never worked and in fact an agreement in	principle historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither	party really wanted the quarrel settled.	8.646848205708821
10931. suppose that this one	were to work?	9.127449882314659
10932.  there was no question in jack's mind of the good	faith on one side at least.	16.012429851565877
10933. if mankind could be convinced of that h	it was worth trying.	7.88257437762797
10934. in fact it had to be tried.	24.98576663201377
10935. it would	be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that earth had	ever signed.	7.950739728011832
10936. secretary hart had taught jack at least partially to	be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters; but there	was no small way to handle this one.	7.002504151625705
10937. he turned back to the	screens the crucial conclusive phrase on his lips.	7.9256312140364
10938. but he was too late.	27.657270061307578
10939. he had lost his audience.	15.6306526737611
10940. for a moment he could make no	sense at all of what he saw.	13.883206222786983
10941. it seemed to be only a riot of color light	and meaningless activity.	11.848590042306634
10942. gradually he realized that the pentagon	of angel elders had vanished and that the ritual learning dance of	the nursery had been broken up.	7.334172383305516
10943. the angels in the nursery were zigzagging	wildly in all directions seemingly at random.	0.0
10944. hesperus!	what's going on here?	11.568363037656766
10945.  what's happened?	8.401180936029741
10946.    your	brothers have been found.	11.568363037656766
10947. they are on their way here.	17.082094893376148
10948. where?	19.804021762487697
10949.  i don't see them.	6.084341628539399
10950. the instruments don't show them.	13.848082117783294
10951. you can't see them yet jack.	6.367225191385647
10952. they'll be in range	in a short while.	6.6289753843903
10953. jack scanned the skies the boards and	the skies again.	6.547479639170025
10954. no- there was a tiny pip on the radar;	and it was getting bigger rapidly.	8.251252432117036
10955. if that was the skiff it was making	unprecedented speed.	0.0
10956. then the skiff hove into sight just	a dot of light at first against the roiling blackness and crimson streaks	of the coal sack.	7.280158286512424
10957. through the telescope jack could see that	both spacesuits were still attached to it.	7.129445514922139
10958. the sail was still unfurled	though there were a good many holes in it as langer had predicted	would be the case by now.	7.918613288279828
10959. it was a startling almost numenous	sight; but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an	enormous comet's-tail of angels.	10.4567288281964
10960. the skiff was not heading	for the nursery however.	10.582206877639416
10961. it seemed unlikely that her crew if either	of them were alive could even see the ariadne for they were passing	her at a distance of nearly a light-year.	5.9127764110214756
10962. and there would be no	chance of signaling them- without the nernst generator jack could	not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static and by	the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone.	7.416799495565291
10963. fuming helpless he watched them pass him.	7.14162538120728
10964. the sail ragged	though it was still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of	power being poured out from the nursery stars.	7.887739882487606
10965. he would never have believed	without seeing it that the bizarre little vessel could go so	fast.	8.729608424786454
10966. but where was it going?	19.49450951439212
10967.  and why was it causing so much	agitation among the angels and being followed by so many of them?	7.812252363792124
10968. 	there was only one possible answer but jack's horrified	mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar plots of the skiff's	course into the computer.	6.400585945516949
10969. the curve on the card the computer	spat back at him couldn't be argued with however.	6.196120048044738
10970. the skiff	was headed for the very center of the nebula- toward that place which	jack knew now could hold nothing less important than the very core	of the angel's life and religion.	7.749943859944991
10971. it was clear that langer	had at last found a way to attract the angel's attention.	11.43902686201217
10972. it was equally clear that as of this moment the treaty was off.	11.455245618923785
10973. langer would have to be headed off whether	he knew where he was going or not.	10.264992231772533
10974. almost surely he did; after all	he had had the same set of facts as jack had had to work from and	he was an almost frighteningly observant man.	6.333234254760902
10975. but not having talked	to the angels he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along	the line.	7.905415341781941
10976. had he decided perhaps that the center of the cloud	was	a center of government instead of a center of life and faith?	9.410730226673008
10977. 	but it didn't matter now whether he meant to invade the holy	of holies or was simply headed in that direction by accident.	5.719618084621793
10978. if	it was intentional it was now also unnecessary; and whether intentional	or not the outcome would be disastrous.	6.748510665599446
10979. jack crawled under	the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had excised from	the nernst generator switch.	5.121869688821158
10980. when he was back on his feet again	and about to reinstall the fuses however he hesitated.	10.637525725885334
10981. he had	to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff and he had to have	it fast.	8.713290499555995
10982. but fusion power in the coal sack was what had triggered	all the trouble in the first place- and he already had an angel aboard.	8.520910618568008
10983. i'm	going to turn my generator back on as i promised to do.	5.825820622377272
10984. but i can't	take you to earth yet.	16.239762984882013
10985. first i've got to intercept my brothers	before they get any deeper into trouble.	6.511591705507893
10986. will you obstruct this	or will you help?	11.775292123015198
10987.  i know it's not part of the bargain and your	elders might not like it.	8.546495096048107
10988. nobody else can live in your	hearth while i am in it hesperus said promptly.	7.78190563939677
10989. as for my elders	they have already admitted that they were wrong.	9.42680368706412
10990. if because of	this incident they become angry with earth i will not be permitted	to go there at all.	8.856021111336474
10991. therefore of course i will help.	10.886199914602827
10992. with	a short-lived sigh of relief jack plugged the fuses back in and threw	the switch.	7.032105024464237
10993. without an instant's transition the green light that	meant full fusion power winked on the board.	5.771383279736075
10994. always before it had	taken five minutes to-   of course.	8.362327575108047
10995. from	here on out the ariadne was going to be hotter than any space	cruiser man had ever dreamed of.	6.320077487249449
10996. but since he had failed to	anticipate it he lost the five minutes anyhow in plotting an intercept	orbit.	9.409014824555035
10997. hesperus don't use this t-tau vector	trick of yours please.	6.460370037324521
10998. ryan hefted his bulk up and supported it on one elbow.	7.615092762846159
10999. he rubbed	his eyes sleepily with one huge paw.	9.026368296067464
11000. ekstrohm nogol you guys	okay?	11.568363037656766
11001.    nothing wrong with me that couldn't be cured	nogol said.	8.397368370591282
11002. he didn't say what would cure him; he had been	explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself.	6.737496598911188
11003. his small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face.	6.352670641660905
11004. well let's	take a ground-level look at the country around here.	11.588680584333435
11005. the facsiport rolled open on the landscape.	8.976097203071156
11006. a range of bluffs	hugged the horizon the color of decaying moss.	10.601977221576893
11007. above them the sky	was the black of space or the almost equal black of the winter sky above	minneapolis seen against neon-lit snow.	5.636038071104872
11008. that cold empty sky was	full of fire and light.	10.44343699232173
11009. it seemed almost a magnification of the galaxy	itself of the milky way blown up by some master photographer.	7.5397878010045
11010. this fiery swath was actually only a belt of minor planets	almost like the asteroid belt in the original solar system.	8.215843633134716
11011. these	planets were much bigger nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere.	6.002446559592496
11012. but to the infuriation of scientists for no known reason not all of	them did.	10.928600126034778
11013. this would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids	of yancy-6 in three generations.	9.177731967121193
11014. they lay months away from the nearest	earth star by jump drive and no one knew what they were good for	although it was felt that they would probably be good for something	if it could only be discovered- much like the continent of antarctica	in ancient history.	7.678909076855233
11015. how can a planet with so many neighbors	be so lonely?	8.911879279033903
11016.  ryan asked.	15.594944937291627
11017. he was the captain so he could	ask questions like that.	10.743926260935995
11018. some can be lonely in a crowd	nogol said elaborately.	9.584783452671674
11019. what will we need outside ryan?	10.34648963827048
11020. 	ekstrohm asked.	15.594944937291627
11021. no helmets the captain answered.	10.628794361170721
11022. we can breathe out there all right.	15.139777690503488
11023. it just won't be easy.	14.93623902024112
11024. this old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago.	9.082686404028868
11025. nitrogen	and oxygen are about it.	8.254441635698543
11026. ryan look over there	nogol said.	10.472119682746735
11027. think they're intelligent	maybe hostile?	11.430068883054222
11028.    i think they're dead ekstrohm	interjected quietly.	19.061703932371586
11029. i get no readings from them at all.	9.169644675936961
11030. sonic	electronic galvanic- all blank.	11.568363037656766
11031. according to these needles they're	stone dead.	12.002787321537234
11032. ekstrohm you and i will have a look	ryan said.	12.62526755829106
11033. you hold down the fort nogol.	11.823504411807077
11034. easy nogol confirmed.	14.027712197458941
11035. i heard a story once about	a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldn't	get an encephalographic reading on him.	5.630248229889276
11036. me i know the mind	of an officer works in a strange and unfathomable manner.	7.737926519342896
11037. i'm	not worried about you mis-reading the dials nogol just about	a lug like you reading them at all.	5.236383152695367
11038. remember when the little hand	is straight up that's negative.	9.705268617267441
11039. positive results start when it goes	towards the hand you use to make your mark.	5.821849765783676
11040. ryan told him what he could do then.	10.94873513418626
11041. ekstrohm	smiled and followed the captain through the airlock with only	a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall.	5.391783373294707
11042. the strong negative field	his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects.	8.174413315489243
11043. actually	the types of infection that could attack a warm-blooded mammal	were not infinite and over the course of the last few hundred years	adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories.	5.969651984732209
11044. he wasn't	likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever.	10.00708833805685
11045. they ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and with only	a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance dropped	to the ground.	5.95426293446165
11046. it was day but in the thin atmosphere contrasts	were sharp between light and shadow.	13.012007510586653
11047. they walked from midnight	to noon noon to midnight and came to the beast sprawled on its side.	7.446409008128629
11048. ekstrohm nudged it with a boot.	11.417277206425638
11049. hey this is pretty close	to a wart-hog.	7.14162538120728
11050. one of the	best matches i've ever found.	18.702622605902395
11051. well it has to happen.	14.387055325262873
11052. still it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to	find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world.	8.314697679054335
11053. it makes	you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some big joke and	somebody has been everywhere before you even started.	6.267346744067786
11054. the	surveyor looked sidewise at the captain.	9.670406878971576
11055. the big man seldom	gave out with such thoughts.	9.058583833820324
11056. what shall	we do with this one?	13.126227377958582
11057.  dissect it?	12.292407525564322
11058.    ryan nudged it with	his toe following ekstrohm's example.	8.581436094141479
11059. it sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species	to me.	8.132629406549228
11060. no hands for one thing.	13.484377447423066
11061. of course that's not definite	proof.	15.754054259857726
11062. no it isn't ekstrohm said.	13.484377447423066
11063. i	think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological	setup around here.	6.504485355708924
11064. in the meantime we might be thinking on	the problem all these dead beasts represent.	11.611933442411688
11065. what killed them?	16.035421498336767
11066. 	it looks like we did when we made blastdown.	8.196044167676531
11067. but	what about our landing was lethal to the creatures?	6.460370037324521
11068. 	radiation?	19.804021762487697
11069.  ekstrohm suggested.	12.292407525564322
11070. the planet is very low	in radiation from mineral deposits and the atmosphere seems to shield	out most of the solar output.	8.745898847204742
11071. any little dose of radiation might knock	off these critters.	7.524892144125054
11072. i don't know about that.	6.0964767090762
11073. maybe	it would work the other way.	7.622507342753323
11074. maybe because they have had virtually	no radioactive exposure and don't have any r's stored up they	could take a lot without harm.	7.6051683742883025
11075. then maybe it was the	shockwave we set up.	8.20532328403787
11076. or maybe it's sheer xenophobia.	12.833041965406032
11077. they curl	up and die at the sight of something strange and alien- like a spaceship.	6.376876511860498
11078. at this stage	of the game anything could be possible.	13.400532751372204
11079. but there's one possibility	i particularly don't like.	8.418897191255065
11080. and that is?	31.457922823996512
11081. 	suppose it was not us	that killed these aliens.	8.167867558607044
11082. suppose it is something	right on the planet native to it.	9.723644663794278
11083. i just hope it doesn't work	on earthmen too.	10.41765113989062
11084. these critters went real sudden.	12.678917125559895
11085. ekstrohm	lay in his bunk and thought the camp is quiet.	6.210871206873012
11086. the	earthmen made camp outside the spaceship.	9.670406878971576
11087. there was no reason to leave	the comfortable quarters inside the ship except that faced with	a possibility of sleeping on solid ground they simply had to get out.	7.394625013199234
11088. the camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles ringed with a spy	web to alert the earthmen to the approach of any being.	7.34666920488753
11089. each	man had a bubble to himself privacy after the long period of enforced	intimacy on board the ship.	5.726173925838508
11090. ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened	to the sounds of the night on yancey-6 138.	8.883013402178744
11091. there was a keening	of wind and a cracking of the frozen ground.	11.15724393844686
11092. insects there were on	the world but they were frozen solid during the night only to revive	and thaw in the morning sun.	7.108551420335513
11093. the bunk he lay on was much more	uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board.	6.374057384651866
11094. yet he knew the	others were sleeping more soundly now that they had renewed their	contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high	vacuum.	7.4797049856303435
11095. now there could be an	end to pretending.	11.385006813316828
11096. he threw off the light blanket and swung	his feet off the bunk to the floor.	9.112998257296404
11097. there	was no longer any need to hide.	8.871998250907023
11098. but what was there to do?	20.19236609887658
11099.  what had	changed for him?	13.359616238729945
11100.    he no longer had to lie in his bunk all night	his eyes closed pretending to sleep.	8.463790579529437
11101. in privacy he could walk	around leave the light on read.	8.183213117121184
11102. it was small comfort for insomnia.	21.30159973117459
11103. some doctors had informed him he	was mistaken about this.	7.555016367052815
11104. actually they said he did sleep but so shortly	and fitfully that he forgot.	8.228058686047829
11105. others admitted he was absolutely	correct- he never slept.	8.519169806948323
11106. his body processes only slowed down enough	for him to dispell fatigue poisons.	8.059409733643921
11107. occasionally he fell into a	waking gritty-eyed stupor; but he never slept.	6.480693448216934
11108. naturally he couldn't let his shipmates know this.	9.562664058756887
11109. insomnia	would ground him from the exploration service on physiological	if not psychological grounds.	6.527247349132692
11110. he had to hide it.	25.659219419391817
11111. over the	years he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could confide.	6.973716106968502
11112. the buddies invariably took advantage of him.	11.387658710676023
11113. since he couldn't	sleep anyway he might as well stand their watches for them or write	their reports.	6.596079166598416
11114. where the hell did he get off threatening to report	any laxness on their part to the captain?	8.37994952077852
11115.  a man with insomnia had	better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him.	6.965294609714713
11116. ekstrohm had to hide his secret.	9.670406878971576
11117. in a camp instead of	shipboard hiding the secret was easier.	9.41105084804108
11118. but the secret itself was	just as hard.	15.227354815117762
11119. ekstrohm picked up a lightweight no-back from the	ship's library a book by bloch the famous twentieth century expert	on sex.	5.263432701720354
11120. he scanned a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated	nineteenth century sex murderer but he couldn't seem to concentrate	on the weighty pontifical ponderous style.	7.134701507884765
11121. on impulse	he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the	hatch of the bubble.	6.231299284568089
11122. ekstrohm walked through the alien glass	and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations smelling the frozen sterility	of the thin air.	7.338897613321559
11123. behind him his mates stirred without	waking.	9.971796932341148
11124. ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a	banging on the hatch of his bubble.	7.898488776977889
11125. it took him a few seconds to put	his thoughts in order and then he got up from the bunk where he had been	resting sleeplessly.	7.2192104105912485
11126. the angry burnt-red face of ryan greeted	him.	11.387658710676023
11127. okay stormy this isn't the place for fun and games.	6.210871206873012
11128. what did you do with them?	15.120916080885502
11129.    do with what?	17.462072214443666
11130. 	the dead beasties.	13.148092146312546
11131. all the dead animals laying around the ship.	9.746226610466692
11132. what are you talking about ryan?	19.147156018699693
11133.  what do you think i	did with them?	17.72497555790629
11134.    i don't know.	8.280368894557514
11135. all i know is that they	are gone.	8.961969194380144
11136. gone?	19.804021762487697
11137.    ekstrohm shouldered	his way outside and scanned the veldt.	6.764147616291221
11138. there was no ring of animal	corpses.	26.84798141185944
11139. nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen	breeze.	7.650142392474281
11140. i'll be damned ekstrohm said.	6.321180167012423
11141. you	are right now buddy.	9.118533821976325
11142. expe doesn't like anybody mucking up primary	evidence.	9.060328853487057
11143. where do you get off ryan?	10.044583681921951
11144.  ekstrohm	demanded.	19.804021762487697
11145. why pick me for your patsy?	9.684323749366209
11146.  this has got to be some	kind of local phenomenon.	13.580546355572395
11147. why accuse a shipmate of being behind this?	8.257640091759392
11148. 	listen ekstrohm i want to give you the benefit of	every doubt.	10.143422291442931
11149. but you aren't exactly the model of a surveyor you know.	8.860709006202686
11150. you've been riding on a pink ticket for six years you know that.	6.072739869207662
11151. no ekstrohm said no i didn't know that.	8.17636563921545
11152. you've been hiding things from me and nogol every jump	we've made with you.	5.693935231539689
11153. now comes this! it fits the pattern of secrecy	and stealth you've been involved in.	7.01750234008083
11154. what could i	do with your lousy dead bodies?	11.921029140940288
11155.  what would i want with them?	11.381895949116338
11156. 	all i know is that you were outside the bubbles last night	and you were the only sentient being who came in or out of our alarm	web.	6.364242546740684
11157. now all the bodies are missing like they	got up and walked away.	6.713926052561442
11158. it was not a new experience to ekstrohm.	22.972559927717377
11159. suspicion wasn't new to him at all.	9.416324377007264
11160. ryan	there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies.	7.879513779734377
11161. look	for them will you?	9.118533821976325
11162.  i give you my word i'm not trying to pull	some stupid kind of joke or to deliberately foul up the expedition.	7.279247487033728
11163. take my word can't you?	10.118940873009322
11164.    ryan shook his head.	11.568363037656766
11165. i don't	think i can.	14.392431089066493
11166. there's still such a thing as mental illness.	5.603364996017602
11167. you	may not be responsible.	10.157270994812965
11168. don't	try anything violent stormy.	11.568363037656766
11169. i outweigh you fifty pounds and	i'm fast for a big man.	7.920146737168444
11170. i wasn't planning on jumping	you.	12.66615925928101
11171. why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong?	11.388777584800145
11172. 	she lived and was given a name.	9.060328853487057
11173. for her first three vegetable	months she waved her crabbed claws kicked weakly with her clubbed	feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant.	5.439788407572194
11174. she was not alone	for there were three other such children in the big city's special	nursery.	10.817526684684777
11175. soon they all were removed to central laboratory school	where their delicate transformation began.	7.108256989545012
11176. one of the babies	died in the initial transferral but of helva's class seventeen	thrived in the metal shells.	10.889070611316614
11177. instead of kicking feet helva's	neural responses started her wheels; instead of grabbing with hands	she manipulated mechanical extensions.	7.017950403160634
11178. as she matured more and more	neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went	into the maintenance and running of a space ship.	7.331835168355716
11179. for helva was	destined to be the brain half of a scout ship partnered with a	man or a woman whichever she chose as the mobile half.	5.836554568500412
11180. she would be	among the elite of her kind.	11.557104603852515
11181. her initial intelligence tests registered	above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high.	6.183003451448296
11182. as long	as her development within her shell lived up to expectations and there	were no side-effects from the pituitary tinkering helva would live	a rewarding rich and unusual life a far cry from what she would have	faced as an ordinary normal being.	6.340392602630257
11183. however no diagram	of her brain patterns no early iq tests recorded certain essential	facts about helva that central must eventually learn.	5.556304376121015
11184. they	would have to bide their official time and see trusting that the massive	doses of shell-psychology would suffice her too as the necessary	bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession.	5.762497154626007
11185. a ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with	the power and resources central had to build into their scout ships.	5.114810761233693
11186. brain ships were of course long past the experimental stages.	8.42590376083644
11187. most	babes survived the techniques of pituitary manipulation that kept	their bodies small eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller	to larger shells.	5.833942733956985
11188. and very very few were lost when the final connection	was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine.	7.973147204266182
11189. shell	people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities	were but the well-oriented brain would not have changed places	with the most perfect body in the universe.	5.152621062652346
11190. so for happy years	helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates playing such	games as stall power-seek studying her lessons in trajectory	propulsion techniques computation logistics mental hygiene basic	alien psychology philology space history law traffic codes: all	the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning logical	informed citizen.	5.818487943640943
11191. not so obvious to her but of more importance	to her teachers helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as	easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid.	5.657890385526852
11192. she would one day be grateful	to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction.	9.416787766541301
11193. helva's civilization was not without busy do-good associations	exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial as well as extraterrestrial	citizens.	6.401368991752259
11194. one such group got all incensed over shelled children	when helva was just turning fourteen.	9.147527049952899
11195. when they were forced	to central worlds shrugged its shoulders arranged a tour of the laboratory	schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the	members case histories complete with photographs.	6.779358238818638
11196. very few committees	ever looked past the first few photos.	12.126166407417266
11197. most of their original objections	about shells were overridden by the relief that these hideous	bodies were mercifully concealed.	7.495733760670601
11198. helva's	class was doing fine arts a selective subject in her crowded program.	7.391013650626644
11199. she had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later	use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel.	6.755599647819141
11200. her	subject	was large- a copy of the last supper- and her canvas small-	the head of a tiny screw.	8.370717655627091
11201. she had tuned her sight to the proper	degree.	9.965850596706412
11202. as she worked she absentmindedly crooned producing a curious	sound.	12.181076897243338
11203. shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound	issued through microphones rather than mouths.	5.326519577128725
11204. helva's hum then	had a curious vibrancy a warm dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic	wanderings.	7.082240814220785
11205. why what a lovely voice you have	said one of the female visitors.	8.551945576148809
11206. helva looked up and caught	a fascinating panorama of regular dirty craters on a flaky pink surface.	6.757567981697296
11207. her hum became a gurgle of surprise.	8.154987146205233
11208. she instinctively regulated	her sight until the skin lost its cratered look and the pores	assumed normal proportions.	7.735353964671092
11209. yes we have quite a few years	of voice training madam remarked helva calmly.	7.767951575872715
11210. vocal peculiarities	often become excessively irritating during prolonged intra-stellar	distances and must be eliminated.	8.234678314852948
11211. although this was the first time that helva had seen unshelled	people she took this experience calmly.	8.436561334441596
11212. any other reaction would have	been reported instantly.	10.102979009923285
11213. i meant that you have a nice singing	voice h dear the lady amended.	9.020431141465878
11214. would	you like to see my work?	12.193066547509792
11215.  helva asked politely.	10.363724110347151
11216. she instinctively	sheered away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away	for further meditation.	8.171394947443085
11217. i am currently reproducing the last supper on the head of a screw.	11.701370563470412
11218. o i say the lady twittered.	16.646095230094698
11219. helva turned	her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically.	6.002446559592496
11220. of course some of my color values do not match the old master's	and the perspective is faulty but i believe it to be a fair	copy.	11.384695445480714
11221. the lady's eyes unmagnified bugged out.	9.802060557618772
11222. oh i forget and helva's voice was really contrite.	9.209344271860562
11223. if she	could have blushed she would have.	10.355462156122869
11224. you people don't have adjustable	vision.	15.233429227980745
11225. the monitor of this discourse grinned with pride	and amusement as helva's tone indicated pity for the unfortunate.	5.902564164932943
11226. here this will help suggested helva substituting	a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture.	8.54354563985759
11227. in a kind of shock the ladies and gentlemen of the committee	bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed last	supper on the head of a screw.	8.12971191762765
11228. well remarked one gentleman	who had been forced to accompany his wife the good lord can	eat where angels fear to tread.	7.513328524263081
11229. are you referring sir	asked helva politely to the dark age discussions of the number	of angels who could stand on the head of a pin?	7.962914197439772
11230.    i had	that in mind.	18.25917094604721
11231. if you substitute 'atom' for 'angel'	the problem is not insoluble given the metallic content of the	pin in question.	7.556635699664603
11232. which you are programed to compute?	11.411762843875357
11233. 	of course.	12.292407525564322
11234. did they remember to program a	sense of humor as well young lady?	8.824855318428737
11235.    we are directed	to develop a sense of proportion sir which contributes the same effect.	8.288672059160659
11236. the good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip	was worth his time.	9.736749750147508
11237. if the investigation committee spent months	digesting the thoughtful food served them at the laboratory school	they left helva with a morsel as well.	6.682104660870068
11238. singing as	applicable to herself required research.	9.670406878971576
11239. she had of course been exposed	to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the	better known classical works such as tristan und isolde candide	oklahoma nozze de figaro the atomic age singers	eileen farrell elvis presley and geraldine todd as well	as the curious rhythmic progressions of the venusians capellan visual	chromatics and the sonic concerti of the altairians.	4.706437468570445
11240. but singing	for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties	to be overcome.	9.887008010130634
11241. shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of	a problem or situation before making a prognosis.	5.535892284966784
11242. balanced properly	between optimism and practicality the nondefeatist attitude of the shell	people led them to extricate themselves their ships and personnel	from bizarre situations.	7.009267041408341
11243. therefore to helva the problem that she	couldn't open her mouth to sing among other restrictions did not	bother her.	5.406664019112
11244. she would work out a method by-passing her limitations	whereby she could sing.	10.242987398630188
11245. she approached the problem by investigating	the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries human and	instrumental.	6.402798769851467
11246. her own sound production equipment was essentially more	instrumental than vocal.	8.745349295385674
11247. breath control and the proper enunciation	of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most	development and practice.	5.083242045036259
11248. shell people did not strictly speaking breathe.	9.424251318913965
11249. for their purposes oxygen and other gases were not drawn from	the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained	artificially by solution in their shells.	5.400569273754009
11250. after experimentation helva	discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain	tone.	9.321964308809935
11251. by relaxing the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity	well into the frontal sinuses she could direct the vowel sounds into	the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat	microphone.	4.8713992634943395
11252. she compared the results with tape recordings of modern	singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar	quality about them not at all unharmonious merely unique.	7.679082385822223
11253. acquiring	a repertoire from the laboratory library was no problem to one trained	to perfect recall.	5.542917982132687
11254. she found herself able to sing any role and any	song which struck her fancy.	8.559727042502269
11255. it would not have occurred to her that	it was curious for a female to sing bass baritone tenor alto mezzo	soprano and coloratura as she pleased.	7.982768559027653
11256. it was to helva only a matter	of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the	music attempted.	10.741384610399065
11257. if the authorities remarked on her curious	avocation they did so among themselves.	8.4523693293472
11258. shell people were encouraged	to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical	work.	8.557768929103208
11259. on the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her	shell helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship	the xh-834.	6.950980296135223
11260. her permanent titanium shell was recessed behind an	even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship.	7.203185581781905
11261. the neural audio visual and sensory connections were made and	sealed.	7.43304005989246
11262. her extendibles were diverted connected or augmented and the	final delicate-beyond-description brain taps were completed while helva	remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings.	6.941080974350345
11263. when she awoke	she was the ship.	12.708757651009384
11264. her brain and intelligence controlled every	function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class	needed.	6.989613124061633
11265. she could take care of herself and her ambulatory half in any	situation already recorded in the annals of central worlds and any	situation its most fertile minds could imagine.	5.84691706177135
11266. her first actual	flight for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels	since she was eight showed her complete mastery of the techniques	of her profession.	6.493458138950358
11267. she was ready for her great adventures and the arrival	of her mobile partner.	9.575385045162779
11268. there were nine qualified scouts sitting	around collecting base pay the day helva was commissioned.	10.732511993673237
11269. there	were several missions which demanded instant attention but helva	had been of interest to several department heads in central for some	time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section.	4.884561692402227
11270. consequently no one had remembered to introduce helva to the prospective	partners.	8.17557889168528
11271. the ship always chose its own partner.	11.147217359465333
11272. had there	been another brain ship at the base at the moment helva would	have been guided to make the first move.	9.506376731214857
11273. as it was while central wrangled	among itself robert tanner sneaked out of the pilots' barracks	out to the field and over to helva's slim metal hull.	8.034584092320445
11274. hello anyone at home?	11.568363037656766
11275.  tanner wisecracked.	12.292407525564322
11276. of course	replied helva logically activating her outside scanners.	11.610299168532578
11277. are	you my partner?	11.723600643567618
11278.  she asked hopefully as she recognized the	scout service uniform.	12.606151612815394
11279. all you have to do is ask he retorted	hopefully.	16.147943779990744
11280. i thought perhaps there	were no partners available and i've had no directives from central.	9.059999578018873
11281. even to herself helva sounded a little self-pitying but	the truth was she was lonely sitting on the darkened field.	6.305891416797736
11282. always	she had had the company of other shells and more recently technicians	by the score.	8.371681114529826
11283. the sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and	become oppressive.	7.43304005989246
11284. no directives from central is scarcely	a cause for regret but there happen to be eight other guys biting their	fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you	you beautiful thing.	6.466179359491326
11285. it would have killed you in the cabin.	18.71942963857734
11286. do you have anything for me?	21.74407606575169
11287. 	mercer stammered not knowing what b'dikkat meant and	the two-nosed man answered for him i think he has a nice baby head	but it isn't big enough for you to take yet.	5.476915644847906
11288. mercer never	noticed the needle touch his arm.	9.060328853487057
11289. b'dikkat had turned to	the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit mercer.	5.674295354649883
11290. he tried to run after b'dikkat to hug the lead spacesuit to tell	b'dikkat that he loved him.	9.058027016699187
11291. he stumbled and fell but it did not	hurt.	11.877094637966294
11292. the many-bodied girl lay near him.	12.435529358277208
11293. isn't it wonderful?	5.006130362527981
11294.  you're beautiful beautiful beautiful.	9.011594807050702
11295. i'm so happy to be here.	4.0320972279153615
11296. the woman covered with	growing hands came and sat beside them.	9.430036403335416
11297. she radiated warmth and good	fellowship.	11.145752833777212
11298. mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming.	8.196044167676531
11299. he struggled out of his clothes.	12.360047368900819
11300. it was foolish and snobbish	to wear clothing when none of these nice people did.	11.707472334128875
11301. the two	women babbled and crooned at him.	8.976097203071156
11302. with one corner of his mind	he knew that they were saying nothing just expressing the euphoria of	a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it.	7.376281431504996
11303. with most	of his mind he was happy.	9.453274480108805
11304. he wondered how anyone could have the good	luck to visit a planet as nice as this.	8.406914292039355
11305. he tried to tell the lady	da but the words weren't quite straight.	9.229421941257328
11306. a painful stab	hit him in the abdomen.	13.302374541844653
11307. the drug went after the pain and swallowed it.	11.09897877440027
11308. it was like the cap in the hospital only a thousand times better.	12.480392195690849
11309. the pain was gone though it had been crippling the first time.	7.8937132813842945
11310. he forced himself to be deliberate.	15.04687202720679
11311. he rammed his mind into focus	and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert	that was a good bite.	6.214954103639055
11312. maybe i will grow another head.	11.548535644303174
11313. that	would make b'dikkat happy!   the lady da forced the foremost	of her bodies in an upright position.	5.326519577128725
11314. said she i'm strong	too.	15.013342074182058
11315. remember man remember.	14.185224116558695
11316. we can die too we can die like real people.	11.794906001175134
11317. i do so believe	in death!   mercer smiled at her through his happiness.	9.32357402524811
11318. but isn't this nice h   with	this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack.	8.219259445435762
11319. he was wide awake	but he did not feel like doing anything.	9.923631093244717
11320. in that beautiful place	among all those companionable and attractive people he sat and smiled.	9.773484020714712
11321. b'dikkat was sterilizing his knives.	8.254441635698543
11322. mercer wondered	how long the super-condamine had lasted him.	8.581436094141479
11323. he endured the ministrations	of the dromozoa without screams or movement.	7.953394054598466
11324. the agonies of nerves	and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near	him but meant nothing.	7.663024046550707
11325. he watched his own body with remote casual	interest.	9.026368296067464
11326. the lady da and the hand-covered woman stayed near him.	9.430036403335416
11327. after	a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his	powerful arms.	6.477201233647785
11328. having arrived he blinked sleepily and friendlily at	them and lapsed back into the restful stupor from which he had emerged.	7.893878171826976
11329. mercer saw the sun rise on occasion closed his eyes briefly and	opened them to see stars shining.	5.236383152695367
11330. the dromozoa	fed him in their mysterious way; the drug canceled out his needs for	cycles of the body.	7.48837548295765
11331. at last he noticed a return of the inwardness	of pain.	10.997683404068063
11332. the pains themselves had not changed; he had.	10.582206877639416
11333. he knew all the events which could take place on shayol.	8.898806823353825
11334. he	remembered them well from his happy period.	9.060328853487057
11335. formerly he had noticed	them- now he felt them.	6.764147616291221
11336. he tried to ask the lady da how long	they had had the drug and how much longer they would have to wait	before they had it again.	8.707562049453962
11337. she smiled at him with benign remote happiness;	apparently her many torsos stretched out along the ground had	a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body.	5.117710496397998
11338. she meant	him well but was in no condition for articulate speech.	9.118601195872367
11339. the	half-man lay on the ground arteries pulsating prettily behind the	half-transparent film which protected his abdominal cavity.	6.493358149305356
11340. mercer	squeezed the man's shoulder.	11.568363037656766
11341. the half-man woke recognized	mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin.	7.472514967835612
11342. 'a good	morrow to you my boy'.	9.670406878971576
11343. that's out of a play.	4.891959009765589
11344. did you ever see	a play?	14.877179522839205
11345.    you mean a game with cards?	11.823504411807077
11346.    no	said the half-man a sort of eye-machine with real people doing	the figures.	8.289788911750433
11347. i never saw that said mercer but	i-   but you want to ask me when b'dikkat is going	to come back with the needle.	7.611410928822407
11348. yes said mercer a little	ashamed of his obviousness.	10.156670255308262
11349. that's why i think of plays.	3.7535542527621146
11350. we all know what is going to happen.	19.04667999034648
11351. we all know when it is going to happen.	14.209581995199503
11352. we all know what the dummies	will do- he gestured at the hummocks in which the decorticated	men were cradled- and we all know what the new people will ask.	8.451402409092166
11353. but we never know how long a scene is going to take.	10.332331064545217
11354. what's	a 'scene'?	15.594944937291627
11355.  asked mercer.	15.804493013470257
11356. is that the name for the	needle?	17.91920835513786
11357.    the half-man laughed with something close to real	humor.	8.341215694113531
11358. you've got the lovelies on the brain.	5.923003360391702
11359. a	scene is just a part of a play.	11.342963562701621
11360. i mean we know the order in which things	happen but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days	or to make calendars and there's not much climate here so none of	us know how long anything takes.	6.882554441293756
11361. the pain seems short and the pleasure	seems long.	9.012483256971692
11362. i'm inclined to think that they are about two earth-weeks	each.	7.096443957475753
11363. mercer did not know what an earth-week	was since he had not been a well-read man before his conviction but	he got nothing more from the half-man at that time.	5.510267251195164
11364. the half-man received	a dromozootic implant turned red in the face shouted senselessly	at mercer take it out you fool! take it out of me!	when mercer looked on helplessly the half-man twisted over on	his side his pink dusty back turned to mercer and wept hoarsely and	quietly to himself.	6.455341386768802
11365. mercer himself could not tell how long it	was before b'dikkat came back.	5.825820622377272
11366. it might have been several days.	27.514061231808526
11367. it might have been several months.	21.687415678907698
11368. once again b'dikkat moved	among them like a father; once again they clustered like children.	8.941105298549155
11369. this time b'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had	grown out of mercer's thigh- a sleeping child's head covered	with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes.	5.239408790216542
11370. mercer got the blissful needle.	10.472119682746735
11371. when b'dikkat cut the head	from mercer's thigh he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage	which held the head	to his own body.	5.703434887995785
11372. he saw the child-face grimace	as the head was cut; he felt the far cool flash of unimportant pain	as b'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which	stopped all bleeding immediately.	7.050027437923726
11373. the next time it was two legs	growing from his chest.	9.624040027248594
11374. then there had been another head beside	his own.	17.804823963765617
11375. or was that after the torso and legs waist to toe-tips	of the little girl which had grown from his side?	5.601109887293008
11376.    he	forgot the order.	13.148092146312546
11377. he did not count time.	20.330024155874902
11378. lady da smiled	at him often but there was no love in this place.	9.302130110915176
11379. she had lost	the extra torsos.	13.83851307075949
11380. in between teratologies she was a pretty and shapely	woman; but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper	to him repeated some thousands of time repeated with smiles and	hope people never live forever.	6.6553329038962215
11381. she found this immensely	comforting even though mercer did not make much sense out of it.	7.0340329379824755
11382. thus events occurred and victims changed in appearance and	new ones arrived.	8.750339123612346
11383. sometimes b'dikkat took the new ones resting in	the everlasting sleep of their burned-out brains in a ground-truck	to be added to other herds.	5.482105696494662
11384. the bodies in the truck threshed and bawled	without human speech when the dromozoa struck them.	7.860799503526907
11385. finally	mercer did manage to follow b'dikkat to the door of the cabin.	6.785973292092455
11386. he	had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it.	9.060005390028206
11387. only the memory	of previous hurt bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if	he did not ask b'dikkat when he mercer was happy the answer would	no longer be available when he needed it.	5.109177495171131
11388. fighting pleasure itself	he begged b'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long	he had been there.	7.381238108121702
11389. b'dikkat grudgingly agreed but he did not	come out of the doorway.	8.133069332684652
11390. he spoke through the public address box built	into the cabin and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain	so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their	happiness and wondered what their friend b'dikkat might be wanting	to tell them.	6.269805039858547
11391. when he said it they thought it exceedingly profound	though none of them understood it since it was simply the amount of time	that mercer had been on shayol:   standard years- eighty-four	years seven months three days two hours eleven and one	half minutes.	6.236561744974687
11392. mercer turned away.	13.148092146312546
11393. the secret little corner of his mind which stayed sane through happiness	and pain made him wonder about b'dikkat.	5.780140237098333
11394. what persuaded the	cow-man to remain on shayol?	12.585241102236301
11395.  what kept him happy without super-condamine?	10.34648963827048
11396. 	was b'dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a	man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day surrounded	by a family of little cow-people resembling himself?	6.204626463762973
11397.  mercer despite	his happiness wept a little at the strange fate of b'dikkat.	6.370413084821668
11398. his	own fate he accepted.	11.568363037656766
11399. he remembered the last time he had eaten-	actual eggs from an actual pan.	0.0
11400. the dromozoa kept him alive	but he did not know how they did it.	11.801938937979154
11401. he staggered back to the	group.	12.127026643485452
11402. the lady da naked in the dusty plain waved a hospitable hand	and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her.	9.0289841831107
11403. there	were unclaimed square miles of seating space around them but he appreciated	the kindliness of her gesture none the less.	5.535488937493352
11404. the years if they were years went by.	13.008572457105636
11405. the land of shayol did not	change.	13.162119585332062
11406. sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across	the plain to the herd of men; those who could talk declared it	to be the breathing of captain alvarez.	6.545873499335468
11407. there was night and day but	no setting of crops no change of	season no generations of men.	8.241102730507091
11408. time	stood still for these people and their load of pleasure was so commingled	with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the	lady da took on very remote meaning.	6.200493671767169
11409. her statement was a hope not a truth in which they	could believe.	6.649093374899663
11410. they did not have the wit to follow the stars in their	courses to exchange names with each other to harvest the experience	of each for the wisdom of all.	10.480514073276964
11411. there was no dream of escape for these	people.	15.840497579329636
11412. though they saw the old-style chemical rockets lift up from	the field beyond b'dikkat's cabin they did not make plans to hide	among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh.	7.3718488558642905
11413. far long ago some	other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter.	7.732077783896534
11414. his	handwriting was on a rock.	11.441118572516087
11415. mercer read it and so had a few of the others	but they could not tell which man had done it.	6.289079952739863
11416. the letter scraped on stone had been a message home.	11.13462238962699
11417. they	could still read the opening: once i was like you stepping	out of my window at the end of day and letting the winds blow me gently	toward the place i lived in.	5.302561948955673
11418. once like you i had one head two	hands ten fingers on my hands.	8.92185985319961
11419. the front part of my head was called	a face and i could talk with it.	6.807867091712346
11420. now i can only write and that only	when i get out of pain.	10.214982174759779
11421. dan morgan told himself he would forget ann turner.	6.602288863182544
11422. he	was well rid of her.	10.649951465826932
11423. he certainly didn't want a wife who was fickle	as ann.	8.435856834513274
11424. if he had married her he'd have been asking for trouble.	13.580771794471305
11425. but all of this was rationalization.	16.419244749812176
11426. sometimes he woke up in	the middle of the night thinking of ann and then could not get back	to sleep.	8.316497141586856
11427. his plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for	so long that now he felt as if he had nothing.	6.488459088839963
11428. the easiest thing would	be to sell out to al budd and leave the country but there was	a stubborn streak in him that wouldn't allow it.	6.900054305824345
11429. the best antidote	for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard	work.	7.5190214974874525
11430. he found that if he was tired enough at night he went to sleep	simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake.	10.2064726365445
11431. each day he found	himself thinking less often of ann; each day the hurt was a little	duller a little less poignant.	5.3875967688313
11432. he had plenty of work to do.	16.55193635861438
11433. because the summer was unusually dry and hot the spring produced a	smaller stream than in ordinary years.	6.795022836550863
11434. the grass in the meadows came	fast now that the warm weather was here.	9.095373081665869
11435. he could not afford to lose	a drop of the precious water so he spent most of his waking hours along	the ditches in his meadows.	6.5121308590339435
11436. he had no idea how much time	budd would give him.	13.093647161087064
11437. in any case he had no intention of being caught	asleep so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he	took his winchester with him and leaned it against the fence.	6.336650757272846
11438. he stopped	every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon	but nothing happened each day dragging out with monotonous calm.	7.000426104312035
11439. when in late afternoon on the last day in june he saw two	people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house he quit work	immediately and strode to his rifle.	6.233246572484019
11440. it could be some kind of trick	budd had thought up.	17.518687731946223
11441. no one walked in this country least of all	ed dow or dutch renfro or any of the rest of the bar b crew.	0.0
11442. morgan watched the two figures for a time puzzled.	9.895600314428009
11443. when they were closer	and he saw that one was a woman he was more puzzled than ever.	7.75092365603415
11444. he cleaned his shovel left it against the fence picked up his	winchester and started downstream.	8.26265427207832
11445. his visitors had crawled through	the south fence and were crossing the meadow angling toward the house.	5.708511922817988
11446. now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly	staggering as if they found it a struggle to remain on their	feet.	9.541626530158686
11447. reaching the house ahead of them he waited with his	winchester in his hands.	6.273387381665005
11448. they crawled through the north fence and came	on toward him and now he saw that both were young not more than nineteen	or twenty.	7.977398471246495
11449. they were dirty their clothes were torn and the	girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from	the front door.	6.166797392070864
11450. she lay there making no effort to get back on her	feet.	10.304069102815689
11451. the boy came on to the porch and sat down his gaze on morgan	as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring.	5.805230789628029
11452. morgan	hesitated thinking that if this was a trick it was a good one.	10.191684830114603
11453. he	didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending.	6.4113176305625865
11454. the	boy licked his dry lips.	10.472119682746735
11455. he asked could we have a drink?	13.54783454121167
11456. 	morgan jerked his head toward the front door.	8.581436094141479
11457. in the kitchen	he said.	19.971035072747803
11458. leaning his winchester against the front of the house	he walked to the girl.	9.917223100679301
11459. there's water in the house.	4.675983334456371
11460. she didn't move or say anything.	9.130607962350611
11461. her eyes were glazed as if	she didn't hear or even see him.	6.382269394684917
11462. she had reached a point at which	she didn't even care how she looked.	9.463673485236166
11463. her face was very thin and burned	by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling the new	skin under it red and angry.	5.55772838090236
11464. her blond hair was frowzy her dress	torn in several places and her shoes were so completely worn out	that they were practically no protection.	6.499993851510746
11465. it must have hurt her even	to walk for the sole was completely off her left foot and morgan saw	that it was bruised and bleeding.	7.440490959900155
11466. he picked her up sliding one	hand under her shoulders the other under her knees and carried her	into the house.	7.816973914534184
11467. she was amazingly light and so relaxed in his arms	that he wasn't even sure she was conscious.	6.481409197065396
11468. any lingering suspicion	that this was a trick al budd had thought up was dispelled.	8.245871118902311
11469. no girl	would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him.	6.289796640564554
11470. besides she	had a sweet face that attracted him.	9.638918084835845
11471. he put her down on the	couch and going into the kitchen saw that the boy had dropped into a	chair beside the table.	6.118860983357414
11472. they looked a good deal alike morgan thought.	14.159769149993837
11473. both had blonde hair and blue eyes and there was even a faint similarity	of features.	8.209841614532648
11474. morgan filled the dipper from the water	bucket on the shelf went back into the front room lifted the girl's	head and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth.	7.1397097047906435
11475. she drank greedily	and murmured thank you as he lowered her head.	7.187557404882245
11476. he	stood looking down at her for a moment wondering what could have reduced	her to this condition.	8.939966036876687
11477. he had seen a few nester wagons go through	the country the families almost starving to death but he had never	seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two.	6.392687593471784
11478. the girl	dropped off to sleep.	13.848082117783294
11479. morgan returned to the kitchen built a fire	and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured	into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove.	5.8006210204306115
11480. he brought	his winchester in from the front of the house then faced the boy.	14.956042527552608
11481. who are you and what happened to you?	11.879285871565685
11482.  he asked.	27.770505909397876
11483. i'm billy jones the boy answered.	4.0320972279153615
11484. we ran out of money and we haven't eaten for two days.	9.587944246952246
11485. what are you doing here?	17.632317597370832
11486.    are we in wyoming?	22.138920418755124
11487. 	morgan nodded.	12.292407525564322
11488. about five miles north of the line.	15.152625218202909
11489. jones sighed as if relieved.	9.380284888114716
11490. we've been looking for work	but all the ranchers have turned us down.	5.45171308170528
11491. you mean you	dragged your wife all over hell's half-acre looking for work?	7.665003147107107
11492. 	morgan demanded.	15.594944937291627
11493. the town of buckhorn's only about six miles	from here.	8.389679824170722
11494. why didn't you go there?	13.663388853342104
11495.    we didn't want	town work jones said.	10.717432709549398
11496. this is a mighty empty country	morgan said.	19.99530004640928
11497. there's only one more ranch three miles north	of here.	4.3589877313461995
11498. you'd have starved to death if you'd missed both places.	7.437578767697484
11499. then we're lucky we got here.	9.61074369102138
11500. could you give us a	job mr h   morgan.	9.807724056868572
11501. he was	silent a moment thinking he could use a man this time of year and if	the girl could cook it would give him more time in the meadows but	he knew nothing about the couple.	5.9311323621661005
11502. they might kill him in his sleep thinking	there was money in the house.	11.20254647807371
11503. he dismissed the possibility at	once.	12.127026643485452
11504. the girl's thin face haunted him.	12.435529358277208
11505. it wasn't the face of a	killer.	15.9272309263861
11506. he wasn't so sure about the boy.	12.411802052220429
11507. he hadn't shaved for several	weeks his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic woebegone expression.	6.512874137333827
11508. there was more to this than jones had told him.	14.698513644193772
11509. they	were running from something.	10.27900613288638
11510. he'd be an idiot to let them stay	he thought but he couldn't send them on either.	7.448168936426921
11511. i could	use some help morgan said finally but i can't afford to pay	you anything.	5.341276970875824
11512. i guess you'd better go on in the morning.	12.830308075018873
11513. we'll work for our keep the boy said eagerly.	4.077585458255311
11514. i've been	mucking in a mine in the san juan but i used to work on a ranch.	6.731635446741555
11515. sharon she's cooked in a restaurant.	7.622507342753323
11516. we'll work hard mr morgan.	5.195753516392166
11517. right now you need	a meal and a bath.	7.607728967111214
11518. your wife's in terrible shape.	11.859129509932668
11519. i	know jones said dejectedly.	9.118533821976325
11520. morgan filled the fire box	with wood again then started supper and set the table.	7.838163577917966
11521. when the meal	was ready he told jones to wash up and going into the front room	woke the girl.	6.557212435250233
11522. he said i've got some supper ready.	17.04255706974967
11523. she	rubbed her eyes and stretched then sat up her hands going to her	hair.	5.674295354649883
11524. i'm a mess she said and suddenly she was alarmed.	4.764711232350748
11525. who	are you?	12.292407525564322
11526.  how did we get here?	16.953574445288268
11527.    i'm dan morgan.	4.172730491814591

11529. you fell down in front of the house	and i carried you in.	10.511386332485396
11530. i gave you a drink and then you went to sleep.	10.21600417043405
11531. she stared at him her eyes wide as she thought	about what he had said; then she murmured: you're very kind	mr morgan.	5.524137465800026
11532. do you take in all the strays who come by?	13.671135208171233
11533. 	i don't have many strays coming to my front door he said.	5.825820622377272
11534. think you can walk to the table?	12.746425383264153
11535.    of course.	22.50110393273728
11536. she got to her feet staggered and almost fell.	10.090117903264954
11537. he caught her	by an arm and helped her into the kitchen.	7.560809233574742
11538. she sat down at the table	shaking her head.	13.902762446146971
11539. i'm usually a	very strong woman but i'm awfully tired.	3.95834514274077
11540. it's not much of a meal but it's what	i eat.	4.325614882285625
11541. not much of a meal?	12.265573073940953
11542.  the girl cried.	18.83174821599479
11543. mr	morgan it's the best-looking food i ever saw.	6.764147616291221
11544. he	told himself he had never seen two people eat so much.	9.283996778266717
11545. when they were	finally satisfied jones said i think he's going to give us work.	7.639476434645116
11546. the grateful way she looked at morgan made him ashamed	of himself.	9.005093323721033
11547. when he saw the expression in her eyes he knew he couldn't	send them on.	10.791529360303228
11548. she said i guess the lord looks out for fools	drunkards and innocents.	10.028962160681107
11549. which are	you?	16.19882824142316
11550.    we're not drunkards she said.	7.3804064617970475
11551. that's	all i'm sure of.	9.118533821976325
11552. she helped him with the dishes then	he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark.	9.191048607807117
11553. he carried	the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the	wall.	9.418786543196529
11554. he said: you'll feel a lot better after you have a bath.	10.869629738233373
11555. your feet are in bad shape mrs jones.	7.425517705353834
11556. you'll have to go to	town to see the doc.	5.666757849705443

11558. i mean we don't have any way to get there and	we can't expect you to quit work just to take us to town.	7.133705045155472

11563. he said: i'm going to bed.	10.776005861178222
11564. he nodded	at the door in front of him.	14.590866089605505
11565. the bed	isn't made but you'll find plenty of blankets there.	7.43304005989246
11566. you're	awfully kind the girl said.	10.472119682746735
11567. we'll pay you back if	you'll let us.	4.606770265395096
11568. it's all right he said.	3.2927943356586518
11569. you'd better sleep.	8.50172930762657
11570. jones followed	him into the front room closing the door behind him.	8.22227871994032
11571. he said: if	it's all right with you mr morgan i'll sleep out here	on the couch.	6.512874137333827
11572. we haven't slept together since we started.	12.350455461918722
11573. i just	can't take any chances on getting her pregnant and if we were sleeping	together h   he stopped embarrassed and morgan said	i understand that but i don't savvy why you'd go off and leave	your jobs in the first place.	4.592196881176985
11574. we got fired jones	said.	21.15156745952886
11575. we had to do something.	19.783118044325487
11576. they were a pair of lost	whipped kids morgan thought as he went to bed.	11.864658554646157
11577. you can't stay here with me.	6.855509851267169
11578. it's	late and you said they'd be here by dawn.	8.196044167676531
11579. you can't	make me go.	15.784668708114987
11580. gavin sank down again into his chair and began	to rock.	7.879513779734377
11581. he was thinking of rittenhouse and how he had left him	there to rock to death on the porch of the splendide.	7.171945707417333
11582. it was the only	thing in his life for which he felt guilt.	17.255161947077024
11583. beneath his black shirt	his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat the	stored pain shattering free in slow gasps terrible to see.	5.237128200868747
11584. clayton	tried to call back the face of the man he had known.	12.480265416485558
11585. against that other	man he could rally his anger; against this bent man in the chair	he was powerless.	6.254510006460113
11586. gavin's lips moved so that clayton had	to stoop to catch the words.	7.391013650626644
11587. do you remember big charlie?	15.77470249627467
11588.  he	whispered.	19.804021762487697
11589. he stuck with me all these years.	9.783357976961607
11590. just a half-breed	'pache never said much never meant anythin to me but he stuck with	me.	9.172639261561187
11591. he got into a fight with tom english your brother's son.	8.754033591088435
11592. it was a fair fight the boy provoked it- big charlie told me so.	12.00405110959422

11594. my men they all left me.	10.925148545819344
11595. i didn't understand why clay.	7.996641429906819
11596. they just all cleared out.	14.714773213271867
11597. i treated	them fair h	he wiped his lips with a sleeve then stared	at clayton in a childish kind of wonder.	5.957761328531721
11598. do you mean- he	asked almost shyly- you want me to go with you wherever you're	goin?	11.543283882943529
11599.    yes.	15.610129252044759
11600. you don't hate me any more?	8.478871088013367
11601. 	clayton choked shook his head murmuring no.	8.100835098732363
11602. the old man beckoned with one finger and clayton	went forward to him.	9.567666473338514
11603. gavin slipped his arms around his chest and	hugged him fiercely.	6.210871206873012
11604. all my life he said i tried.	0.0
11605. i saw you driftin away- but i tried.	10.360498346572188
11606. and you wanted no part	of me when i had so much to give.	11.570229163504342
11607. now there's nothin left of me.	9.565087858411951
11608. laurel is gone my men are gone ed is dead- and you come to me to	help me.	7.345461562059415
11609. oh! god in heaven i can't refuse you now.	6.460370037324521
11610. that would	mock me too much! can't let you go way from me again h he	closed his eyes ashamed of his tears.	7.134834805926132
11611. clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back.	6.460370037324521
11612. the	eyes followed him fearfully.	11.568363037656766
11613. i'll saddle the horses and bring them round.	4.9334832126488
11614. he burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold	night air.	10.041897220031743
11615. gavin's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches	over the saddle blanket working by touch in the darkness comforting	the animal with easy words.	5.199389211489164
11616. when he had finished he led him and	the mare to the porch.	13.509835311564986
11617. the stallion had smelled the mare coming into	heat and began to paw the turf shaking his head.	6.478108647787729
11618. clayton looped the	reins in a	knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his	neck.	6.757567981697296
11619. the mare had backed away.	10.915477388587384
11620. you take it easy boy clayton	whispered.	16.215129893655938
11621. she doesn't want you now.	10.19441996556735
11622. you take it easy your time	will come.	14.494817959576494
11623. gavin stood on the porch a thin figure.	8.76698370306116
11624. he	had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand	the stock bumping on the wood floor.	7.4034621840547885
11625. clayton called to him and he came	slowly down the steps.	8.323538248997904
11626. clay he said where are we	goin?	10.071985693198506
11627.    to a ranch in the valley.	11.822315645061988
11628. there's someone there	i have to see.	5.798444109528978
11629. we may take her with us- to california.	10.452918720779126
11630. i don't	know yet it's crazy; i have to think about it.	11.924901307870304
11631. but california	is where we're goin.	12.754707820148809
11632. that's a new land.	4.769845249824081
11633. a man could make a mark there.	10.978525873391352
11634. two men	together like us we could do somethin fine out there maybe find a	place where no one's ever been.	6.93295231255783
11635. start out fresh the two of us like	nothin had ever happened.	7.407287750262948
11636. yes like a father and son.	12.767794456650835
11637. i made you what you are gavin whispered.	10.575100839399578
11638. i made	you so you could stand up.	12.626880398769476
11639. i made you a man.	12.384361145835424
11640. he approached the horse and laid a hand on the	stallion's quivering neck.	10.639675320856774
11641. help me up i	feel kind of stiff.	7.14162538120728
11642. clayton lifted him gently into the saddle like	a child.	8.196044167676531
11643. i hate to leave my garden gavin said.	10.381182755283646
11644. i loved my garden.	18.25917094604721
11645. it will grow again-	in california.	20.11792448101284
11646. i loved this valley he whispered	huskily.	13.93195501835056
11647. lived alone here for three years before any man came.	6.754058641432702
11648. lived	alone by the river.	11.568363037656766
11649. it was nice then so peaceful and quiet.	13.356252733642458
11650. there	was no one but me.	14.619341708172643
11651. i don't want to leave it.	4.949437024028267
11652. clayton	swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion's rump.	8.196044167676531
11653. the two horses	broke from the yard from the circle of light cast by the lamp still	burning in the house into the darkness.	6.688725908030852
11654. they	rode at a measured pace through the valley.	8.581436094141479
11655. dawn would come soon	and the night was at its coldest.	7.090018642016223
11656. the moon had sunk below the black crest	of the mountains and the land seen through eyes that had grown accustomed	to the absence of light looked primeval as if no man had ever	trespassed before.	6.64371319432769
11657. it looked as gavin had first seen it years ago	on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly	to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon's	wind- a savage land untenanted and brooding too strong to be	broken by the will of men.	0.0
11658. in that inert landscape	the caravan of his desires passed before his mind.	10.703814417463274
11659. he saw them	ambushed strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying.	7.416545470363821
11660. in vain	his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had	sought so desperately but they would not come to life.	8.095387006263792
11661. the silence oppressed	him made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide	from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through	the darkness in its slow search.	5.181983653000524
11662. they passed ranches that	were framed dark gray against the black hills.	9.33913350279515
11663. then at last the darkness	began to dissolve.	9.525321672928165
11664. a bold line of violet broke loose from the	high ridge of the mountains followed by feathers of red that swept the	last stars from the sky.	6.614943673935176
11665. the wan light spread over the ground and the	valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences	and palely shadowed gullies.	6.4567967126078445
11666. they had been seen as soon	as they left the ranch picked out of the darkness by the weary though	watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless	shelter of the trees.	7.715560638129194
11667. the two men whipped their horses into town	and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon crying their intelligence.	6.287324802449701
11668. the men in pettigrew's were tired from a night's	drinking their faces red and baggy.	10.689950160020043
11669. but the liquor had flushed their	courage.	13.493555769182233
11670. they greeted the news angrily as though they had been cheated	of purpose.	11.708657357397964
11671. lester heard their muttering saw their eyes reveal their	desire.	6.602288863182544
11672. he worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his	cheek and his voice came out of his throat dry and cracked.	8.530868162659038
11673. that's what you wanted isn't it?	4.013884467057159
11674.  clayton is with	him takin him out of the valley.	11.806054526955966
11675. you can't-   keep out	of this purvis snarled.	10.644218033232553
11676. he's not your brother he's gavin's	son.	5.229105600568654
11677. you see he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone.	11.752432084794073
11678. joe purvis was thinking back many years.	9.218221359689302
11679. first he thought of	the time he had ridden to gavin and told him how his cattle were being	rustled at the far end of the valley.	6.243729083550116
11680. he remembered gavin's smirk	his own cringing feeling his impotence.	10.697093789223626
11681. then he thought of a time	when clayton's horse had fallen lame in the gap.	8.705757200133075
11682. his wife had	said to him: nellie is in love with clayton roy.	8.626883035498802
11683. he wouldn't	even dance with her at gavin's party.	9.026368296067464
11684. he treats her like she was	dirt.	13.879903389590947
11685. and you stand by like a fool and let him do it h   he	remembered clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked	him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water.	6.051085227125725
11686. it was	the night clayton had tricked them in the poker game.	14.749107487231763
11687. you're gavin's	son joe purvis had said.	6.2419695959693735
11688. you brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find	your boy.	8.974310828266274
11689. he meant to help gavin all the time.	9.802842312442479
11690. he made a fool of	you lester.	21.04491955904991
11691. he swung round to the other men- we can catch	him easy! there are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place.	6.947188279628536
11692. if	we let them go they won't stay away they'll find men to ride with	them and they'll be back.	6.80263439824598
11693. there's only one way they can get out	now and that's through the gap- if we ride hard we can take them.	4.359355503839404
11694. lester's hand fluttered to cabot's shoulder.	9.670406878971576
11695. he killed tom- do you understand that?	10.14352705623984
11696. 	cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they	would do wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the	cold of the ebbing night.	7.0768614990088405
11697. he fled through the door and down the steps	running and the men grunted and followed pushing lester to one	side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised	before his eyes to shut out the light.	5.427870873614131
11698. purvis and silas pettigrew	were the last to leave.	10.098877781168886
11699. they mounted up and rode slowly behind the	others at a safe distance.	7.0542205307673
11700. in the cold dawn	the mist swirled low to the ground then rose with a gust of sudden wind	to leave the valley clear.	9.534458510955531
11701. the clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight	swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold	light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams	over the dazzling snow.	5.045144822776985
11702. when they turned in the saddle they could	see the men behind them strung out on the prairie in a flat black line.	8.559591945749858
11703. the wind of their running was cold and wild the horses were lathered	and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind.	5.392585924657252
11704. the mare began to tire and clayton felt the spray of snow from	the hoofs of gavin's stallion.	7.48837548295765
11705. he looked over his shoulder at the	thin dotting of pursuers.	7.953394054598466
11706. they neither gained nor fell back.	13.133843158043385
11707. he rode	low on the mare's neck.	10.776005861178222
11708. ahead of him gavin turned slightly off the	trail and pointed for the gap no more than a mile away.	8.282595012204844
11709. gavin's	face was bloodless with excitement.	8.254441635698543
11710. he did not look back; he	could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out	across the prairie to the north.	8.316086472634666
11711. he knew who was riding after him-	the men he had known all his life the men who had worked for him sworn	their loyalty to him.	7.008494751156934
11712. now they were riding to kill him.	15.47578690371493
11713. and he was	fleeing running- fleeing his death and his life at the same time.	8.667647832259895
11714. the land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in:	his valley.	8.696893592992074
11715. with every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he	crossed one more patch of earth that had been his that he would never	see again.	6.544850292688108
11716. the gap looming before him- the place where had confronted	jack english on that day so many years ago- was his exit from	all that had meaning to him.	7.420770518537629
11717. california is too far he thought.	7.848254163972344
11718. he would never reach california.	21.18935534430853
11719. he was too old- when he passed	up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could	see ahead he was passing from life.	6.293602468474845
11720. the sentry was not dead.	13.848082117783294
11721. he was in fact showing signs of	reviving.	18.256252700549886
11722. he had been carrying an enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball	pistol.	11.564583389344953
11723. a bayonet hung in a belt scabbard.	8.604265568338976
11724. he was partially	uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat.	12.77403531117276
11725. mike stripped these from him	and donned them.	7.14162538120728
11726. he and dean tied and gagged the man using his belt	and shirt for the purpose.	9.142280788587135
11727. they dragged him inside the building.	10.352492626598039
11728. fiske joined them unsteady on his feet.	9.060328853487057
11729. julia seeing the bandage	rushed to him.	7.622507342753323
11730. you are hurt! she breathed.	20.62728783560616
11731. i	never felt better in my life fiske blustered.	9.585935903270716
11732. he turned	to susan and kissed her on the cheek.	11.53167801843261
11733. thank you my dear	he	said.	22.053410381192666
11734. mike silenced them.	13.148092146312546
11735. first we've got to get out of here.	13.684308520936499
11736. we'll	grab horses dean said.	11.568363037656766
11737. the main bunch is outside but	there are some over there inside the wall.	7.00267667147391
11738. mike debated it	trying to decide whether fiske was strong enough to ride.	8.211628357957135
11739. but it at	least offered him a chance for living.	12.500646461563038
11740. and for	the sake of julia and susan it had to be tried.	10.082991692056677
11741. the guerrilla	bivouac	remained silent.	14.843753820270253
11742. light showed in the orderly room across the	parade ground.	9.231574966951777
11743. someone evidently was on duty there.	7.8861859043075775
11744. no doubt there	would be men guarding the horses.	12.456852159104024
11745. about a dozen animals were	held inside the stockade as best mike could make out in the moonlight.	6.6063678369100485
11746. evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available	in an emergency.	7.940874103768368
11747. he handed the guard's rifle to fiske.	9.783357976961607
11748. dean	and myself will try to cut out horses to ride he said.	7.859005551251455

11916.  he shook his head.	17.83289566254582
11917. mr	manuel did that in the war.	9.474431667093892
11918. that's why the british never got the	tribes to fight for the king.	4.989406672681278
11919. mr manuel whispered in the ears	of the sioux that the cheyennes were comin' to raid 'em for their	horses.	5.671415469219829

11927. in this country	there's a war on every time the grass turns green.	10.713261962467861
11928. first it was	the nations against themselves then it was them against the whites.	8.567450933935744
11929. and it's goin' to go on like this year after year until the white	people take over this land.	5.045570666411777
11930. i remember being told it would	happen so fast people would think it took place overnight.	8.511455505189446

11935. well	talkin' ain't goin' to help- let's fort up!   as	i dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection i grudgingly	found myself agreeing with oso's logic especially when i imagined	what would have happened to missy if old knife's large party	of screeching warriors had overrun our company.	4.555860917313279
11936. for unlike	the sioux and the crows the aricaras are not great horsemen nor	are they aggressive like the savage blackfeet.	7.372054225787005
11937. more of an agricultural	nation they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for	survival in the endless wars of the plains.	5.7682890224846
11938. still i was disgusted	with myself for agreeing with montero's methods.	9.09088676501256
11939. surprisingly	he had told the others what he had done.	6.908820694756014
11940. in the brief moment i	had to talk to them before i took my post on the ring of defenses i	indicated i was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade	on the river.	8.204282556553649
11941. i think montero did right amy said firmly.	11.90722482757631
11942. let the savages kill each other what do we care?	11.328689484044578
11943. 	reverend jason was understandably bitter.	8.254441635698543
11944. it was a terrible thing	to do.	25.32102166610615
11945. but oso replied calmly	trouble ain't easy to dodge out in this country rev'rend.	8.285409763333197
11946. gray eyes attacked our camp just as the first	pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky.	7.253299614129841
11947. our camp was	in the center of a wide valley.	11.368385470324792
11948. montero had set up a strong position	using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and	brush.	7.894367486866993
11949. he had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle	and had assigned pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying	to keep them steady under fire.	6.0615275061740554
11950. the pony herd was the one	flaw in our defense; the rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as	many of the animals as possible.	8.241522001977899
11951. wildly bucking horses would make the	position difficult to defend against charging warriors.	5.825820622377272
11952. the cooks	had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time and	on montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day.	9.216700034432904
11953. buckets	were filled the herd fed and watered.	7.14162538120728
11954. the worst part had been the	waiting; although we didn't expect the attack before dawn the long	cloudy night filled with the sounds of the industrious insects seemed	endless.	7.379422411391173
11955. coyotes and hunting wolves sounded like signaling indian	scouts the whinny of a restless pony made one's skin crawl.	5.15576524365156
11956. oso	slept unconcernedly his rifle cradled in his arms; i didn't catch	a wink.	7.391013650626644
11957. every time i closed my eyes i saw gray eyes rushing at	me with a knife.	6.426937507238269
11958. it was a relief when they finally came.	19.139196617203407
11959. they poured through the opening in the valley then spread out in	a long line to come at us brandishing their lances and filling the morning	with their spine-chilling scalp cry.	5.146349420610364
11960. oso montero	called i'll get gray eyes.	9.670406878971576
11961. that'll be a pleasure	to see the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of	his rifle.	5.236383152695367
11962. hold your fire montero was shouting.	10.103298113849831
11963. i'll shoot the first man who doesn't.	5.3598734063464395
11964. i could see them in my sights.	17.988172485904624
11965. they were about a mile off; under	me the ground quivered slightly.	8.084077299926864
11966. at first they were only feathers	and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies hunched over their horses'	heads.	9.06704307321627
11967. gradually they emerged as men.	9.139931845753472
11968. gray eyes was in the lead.	12.134987469719709
11969. his face was split by a vermilion streak his eyes were pools of white;	jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest.	5.868982978662346
11970. he was	naked except for a clout.	16.382646054291385
11971. next to him was a young boy i was sure	had sat near me at one of the trading sessions.	7.169680300160624
11972. his mouth was open his	neck corded with the strain of his screams.	8.059409733643921
11973. i found his chest in my	sights.	13.164418645275045
11974. it had a red circle.	25.81473521031209
11975. the circle came nearer and nearer.	9.802060557618772
11976. my god how long is he going to wait i thought h.	7.976605828466205
11977. at first i thought he had missed.	13.758626721952014
11978. the feathered lance was still above his head.	10.582206877639416
11979. as	he started to slump over another warrior swung him onto his horse.	5.881264192582968
11980. at the last second i dropped my sights	from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony.	8.682024625727331
11981. i saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its	head bouncing like a rubber ball.	6.674115810572968
11982. he started to run but oso's shot	caught him on the wing.	10.897486384879642
11983. he jerked once in the grass and lay still.	9.706986427198157
11984. if you're goin' to kill 'em- kill 'em! oso	growled.	8.962939615574799
11985. what else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire	on all sides.	9.779952169334301
11986. the aricaras broke under the devastating fire wheeled	and retreated.	9.945332631078985
11987. lead up! lead up! they'll be back!	montero was shouting.	6.460370037324521
11988. far up the valley i could see the	rees circling and reorganizing.	10.65322002605649
11989. out in front of our walls the grass	was covered with dead and dying men war shields lances blankets and	wounded and dead horses.	6.893875547742425
11990. the morning air was filled with the sweetish	odor of new-spilled blood the acrid stench of frightened horses	and the bitterness of burned powder.	7.6096172238858415
11991. a horse screamed as it twisted from	side to side in a frenzy.	6.992568265113983
11992. a rifle cracked; the square head fell	over.	10.915928998043894
11993. one of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running	across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek.	8.45011442703396
11994. his legs	pumped furiously his long black hair streamed out behind him.	8.544323270472242
11995. there	was a ragged volley.	11.995464083733335
11996. he was dead before he hit the ground.	14.94857320120787
11997. for christ's sake don't waste your powder on one of 'em!	montero shouted furiously.	7.3158859978125
11998. wait for the charge! the charge	i tell you!   the sharp cries at the end of the valley were	faint.	9.3922668226896
11999. they grew louder as the indians charged again.	8.729760093721831
12000. i could see	their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease their mouths open	shouting their spine-chilling cries.	9.283455960103378
12001. gray eyes is back	montero said.	8.254441635698543
12002. the war captain had been badly wounded and was	fighting to hold his seat.	9.806839755593408
12003. i could see the blood running down his	chest.	14.683131401502942
12004. he was riding between two warriors who held him erect when he	started to slump.	9.688906735989212
12005. in my sights i watched	him looming bigger and bigger.	9.586553235979116
12006. montero's shot had caught him high in	the chest; there was no doubt he was dying.	7.814739189650783
12007. again we waited for montero.	10.283688157474398
12008. this time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted	frantically but they held their fire.	12.070440123414585
12009. the horses were only several	lengths away when he fired.	9.143514200721675
12010. the bullet flung gray eyes from his horse.	10.582206877639416
12011. our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts.	8.076756257669505
12012. but a few reached our wall.	18.445182089734388
12013. i heard the whir of an ax and a canadian's	face burst apart in a bloody spray.	7.008690212545931
12014. i saw little billy rise	and fire almost point blank and an indian's face became shattered	flesh and bone.	8.475949337590892
12015. a second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale	firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible	they were in flight.	7.194723849896014
12016. oso reached up jerked the buck	from the bale and snapped his neck.	7.391013650626644
12017. other indians were running at	the ponies shrilling and waving blankets.	6.777914345066018
12018. reverend jason got one	the canadians the others.	9.186019237828585
12019. i saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by	the twitching body of the man he had shot then run back to his position.	8.612952549318615
12020. the ponies were almost uncontrollable.	13.848082117783294
12021. the pall of dust	they raised made it difficult to see when the aricaras charged again.	7.039470073267151
12022. this time more of them hurdled the barrier.	14.390392567869048
12023. a small indian dived at	montero who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt.	6.358009149338423
12024. it sounded like a man kicking a melon.	13.388290833654258
12025. above me a dark rider was	whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales.	5.917832999199861
12026. although my shot killed his horse he rolled off the bale on top of	me.	8.637901651174987
12027. i could smell woodsmoke grease and oil.	11.695419116937586
12028. his eyes were dark	fluid fearful and he gave a sigh as my knife went in.	8.610607758165054
12029. coming over the	wall he had seemed like a hideous devil.	6.210871206873012
12030. now under me i could see	him for what he really was a boy dressed up in streaks of paint h.	7.678333575328015
12031. the aricaras made one last desperate charge.	8.976097203071156
12032. it was pitiful	to see the thin ranks of warriors old and young wheeling and twisting	their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding	from their saddles by the relentless slam slam of the cruelly efficient	hawkinses.	7.076911536342233
12033. others badly wounded gripped hands in manes knees	in bellies held on as long as possible and then weak from ghastly	wounds slipped sideways slowly almost thoughtfully to be broken under	the slashing hoofs.	5.785565677596943
12034. some gracefully soared from the backs of their	wounded screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the	lead split their hearts or tore their guts h.	6.527171414932445
12035. none of them	reached our walls again.	12.216451405619546
12036. the few survivors grudgingly turned away.	12.435529358277208
12037. in	the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song.	6.214123239492383
12038. she was carrying a quirt and she started to raise it then let it fall	again and dangle from her wrist.	8.128158058477432
12039. i saw your fire she	said speaking slowly making an effort to control her anger.	8.349096582199778
12040. you	could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size.	8.633099307307559
12041. it wouldn't	matter to a fool like you.	11.601728556192805
12042. all	right wilson said quickly.	11.568363037656766
12043. and i appreciate	the advice.	17.71727254748585
12044. he was losing patience again.	19.87986593677342
12045. an hour	before with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness	he would have appreciated company.	6.183924846480278
12046. she had helped him change his mind.	14.431176431654745
12047. i'm not advising you she said.	3.7015045771243886
12048. that fire's too big.	17.150845923962493
12049. and make sure it's out	when you leave in the morning.	8.23699786698917
12050. it	took him a long time to compose himself.	13.520346423378275
12051. there's some mistake	he said finally.	4.675983334456371
12052. you're right about the fire.	8.387192178320554
12053. it's bigger	than it has to be though i don't see where it's doing any	harm.	4.290612895338659
12054. but you're wrong about the rest of it.	17.095584455738695
12055. i'm not leaving in	the morning.	3.699222138671167
12056. why should i?	24.23823096593575
12057.  i own the place.	14.392431089066493
12058. she showed	her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so	that she could get a better look at his face.	7.528339729369748
12059. it didn't seem to tell	her anything.	8.705106217545758
12060. she glanced around the clearing taking in the wagon	and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground the	two kids the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the	far reaches of the firelight.	6.197130710271735
12061. she studied it for a long time.	13.75159317082359
12062. then	she turned back to wilson and smiled and he wasn't quite sure what	she meant	by it.	6.886249538313906
12063. you own this place?	15.784668708114987
12064.  she said and her tone	had softened until it was almost friendly.	12.132165923153005
12065. you bought it?	19.40307901854524
12066. 	from a man in st louis wilson said.	11.420119607208166
12067. the girl laughed.	14.843753820270253
12068. i ought to.	22.150701097072105
12069. my father ran him off here six years ago.	7.457430260325163
12070. he stood watching the girl wondering what	was coming next.	11.420228772298287
12071. she had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around	her wrist and smiling at him.	7.356196120525962
12072. carwood didn't tell you	that she said.	9.670406878971576
12073. but it's understandable.	7.69674876835218
12074. it's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of.	4.658485826915615
12075. and it doesn't make any difference.	14.508668449261632
12076. he sold me a clear title.	13.671139498061125
12077. i	have it with me right here.	9.545209647245795
12078. if you want to see-   never	mind she said sternly.	20.656084645720217
12079. it wouldn't matter to my father	and not to me.	9.740106390825309
12080. i meant what i said about that fire.	11.633205579815934
12081. be sure it's	out when you leave.	14.953058771197819
12082. i'll let you go back to doing the	dishes now.	6.280661590185376
12083. it was meant to insult him and didn't quite	succeed.	11.859831723497784
12084. he took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly	and it was his turn to smile now.	8.472402762768146
12085. i don't mind washing dishes now	and then he said pleasantly.	4.928854484287296
12086. it might hurt	you though.	31.683686230238845
12087. somebody might mistake you for a woman.	7.428480081286302
12088. he meant to say more but he never got the chance.	10.246754943516056
12089. she brought the quirt down slashing it across his cheek and he tried	to step back.	6.257697475937866
12090. she swung the quirt again and this time he caught her	wrist and pulled her out of the saddle.	8.984225912471691
12091. she came down against	him and he tried to break her fall.	8.209822338071609
12092. he grabbed her by the shoulders	and went down on one knee taking her weight so that some of the wind	was driven out of him.	8.405247519312327
12093. it made him a little sick and he let go of	her.	10.483566844810595
12094. he got up slowly and she was already on her feet and he stood	facing her.	9.9709382647831
12095. he wiped the blood from his cheek.	9.783357976961607
12096. i ought to-	he said.	18.25917094604721
12097. he was shaking with anger his breath coming in long	painful gasps.	8.81770600605173
12098. that quirt- i ought to use it on you where it would	do the most good.	10.70906542704759
12099. if you were a man-   she isn't	mister.	14.033648972451692
12100. the voice came from behind him and wilson turned.	10.964701440381639
12101. the fire had gone down and the man was only a shadow against the	trees.	9.47988803328324
12102. but a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light	and wilson had a good look at him.	8.512084097037281
12103. he was tall and dark-skinned a	half-breed wilson thought.	10.939493574783542
12104. and he was handsome despite the long thin	scar that slanted across his cheek.	10.99825032983255
12105. she's not a man	mister he said.	5.199590626032467
12106. if you've got any ideas.	13.208379935979165
12107. he raised	the winchester and pointed it at wilson's chest.	8.431773034471274
12108. put	the rifle down joseph the girl said.	9.060328853487057
12109. i	thought i told you to stay home.	7.14162538120728
12110. the half-breed eased the	winchester down and rested it across his lap.	9.005093323721033
12111. the scar looked pure	white in the half-darkness; his eyes were black and deep-set and expressionless.	6.40429955600299
12112. you shouldn't be riding up here after dark judith	he said quietly.	10.204085970961833
12113. i can take care of this.	18.522113676750312
12114. it's no job for	you.	3.200940729365887
12115. the girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee	and glared at him.	6.817408452020724
12116. he took it without flinching.	17.89381761794641
12117. i said	go home joseph.	14.392431089066493
12118. you've got no business up here.	6.058743502399721
12119. the half-breed	didn't answer this time.	10.915477388587384
12120. but the scar seemed to pull hard	at the corner of his mouth and his eyes were hurt and angry.	8.893983056737822
12121. he watched the half-breed as he turned silently.	9.026368296067464
12122. they	could hear the pony's feet on the dry leaves for a while then the	sound faded out.	7.867395731975124
12123. wilson brushed the dust from his coat.	7.14162538120728
12124. who	was that?	15.594944937291627
12125.  he asked.	21.889553134177078
12126. your personal guard?	15.428181156637756
12127.  you're pretty	hard on him.	7.103211731042159
12128. he works for my father the girl said	and then seemed to change her mind.	9.244956432141908
12129. his name's	joseph sanchez.	12.631558650863068
12130. is there anything else you want to know?	17.98362252811136
12131. 	not now wilson said.	9.118533821976325
12132. i guess i'll find out soon	enough.	13.93195501835056
12133. you've got blood on your cheek.	4.775684975088896
12134. it must	have got there when you fell against me.	12.356930286633146
12135. she wiped it off	with the sleeve of her coat.	7.953336273174813
12136. i'll bet that's as close as	you've been to a man since you were a baby wilson said.	5.350813862707408
12137. he saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle	of the quirt and he grabbed her wrist.	5.8814223863024635
12138. oh no he said	and	he was without humor now.	10.92885737873948
12139. i've had enough of that.	4.8991063637661245
12140. i've had enough	of you.	5.760844415795509
12141. i don't know what goes on around here and i don't	care.	4.667103519579292
12142. i don't know what makes you think you can get away with this	kind of business and i don't care about that either.	6.297090790111638
12143. you took me	by surprise.	15.784668708114987
12144. but i'll know how to handle you next time.	14.217384933543453
12145. she brought up her free hand to hit him but this time he was quicker.	7.821903682754583
12146. he side-stepped her blow and she fell stumbling against the gelding.	9.592132658614503
12147. she finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle.	8.57192931380279
12148. her	hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders held by the string	and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before.	7.141345976950406
12149. he had forgotten that she was so pretty.	12.66136117777819
12150. but her prettiness was what	he had noticed first and all the other things had come afterward:	cruelty meanness self-will.	9.906942144834186
12151. he had known women like that one woman	in particular.	10.05140996736625
12152. and one had been too many.	21.56593318521171
12153. he watched the girl until	she had gone into the trees and waited until he couldn't hear the	sound of her horse any longer then went up to where the children were	sleeping.	5.788954990151543
12154. they weren't sleeping of course but they thought	they were doing him a favor by pretending.	8.320368604903889
12155. he hadn't shown up too	well in their eyes letting himself be browbeaten by a woman.	6.512874137333827
12156. they	expected greater things from him regardless of how trying the circumstances	and they were disappointed.	7.3915229198035135
12157. and determined not to show it.	11.3944679046587
12158. they	lay a little too stiffly with their eyes straining to stay closed.	8.09528547037174
12159. go to sleep he said.	11.189622631959072
12160. there's better	things to do than listen to something like that.	5.468054022635353
12161. i'll be down at	the creek finishing the dishes if you want me.	5.106352624910841
12162. he found	the	pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream.	9.63983903476225
12163. the coyote was calling again and he hoped that this time there would	be no other sounds to interrupt it.	5.670580783382225
12164. not tonight at any rate.	14.174471042466617
12165. he had	a feeling that the girl meant trouble.	9.735550941679392
12166. if she did he could stand	it better in the light.	12.747825990681422
12167. he scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans	and reflected on how things had turned out.	6.955990454870539
12168. that afternoon when they	had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house his hopes had	been high.	9.817927495268885
12169. already some of the pain had gone from amelia's death.	8.726435559257615
12170. there would still be plenty of moments of regret and	sadness and guilty relief.	11.87140610071374
12171. but they were starting a new life.	12.243592785386083
12172. and they	had almost everything they needed: land a house two whiteface	bulls three horses.	8.565190225393588
12173. the land wasn't all wilson had expected	of it.	9.851523114888616
12174. six hundred and forty acres the old man back in st louis	had said; good grass good water.	7.2273685404919865
12175. well the grass was there though	in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it.	6.357736137740203
12176. the	water was there so much of it that it spread all through	the dead orchard.	11.342579774178636
12177. and there was a house; livable perhaps but	badly in need of repairs.	13.150085991530853
12178. in the last analysis though wilson	had little cause to complain.	14.103377732759068
12179. the place had been cheap- just the	little he had left after amelia's burial- and it would serve its	purpose.	6.041237801692851
12180. there was only one place where jake carwood's description	had gone badly awry: the peace and quiet.	12.030109205048033
12181. it hadn't started out	that way.	14.93623902024112
12182. and he had a feeling- thanks to the girl- that things	would get worse before they got better.	10.589948510622724
12183. they had the house cleaned	up by noon and wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring	in the horses.	7.292646559480176
12184. he stood on the porch and watched him struggling with	the heavy harness and finally went over to help him.	8.582795776087332
12185. kathy was already	in the wagon.	8.394614028573898
12186. they were going to town and they were both excited.	15.945725285630184
12187. wilson backed the team into the traces and wished they weren't	going to town at all.	5.427950274147271
12188. he had an uneasy feeling about it.	16.211259576588034
12189. that girl	last night what was her name?	9.509783259141862
12190.  judith pierce.	15.594944937291627
12191. it was the only	thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember.	11.106530160468486
12192. he finished	with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him.	8.824820353737188
12193. he had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning and in	broad daylight it was even less inviting than judith pierce had made	it seem.	6.0924755685767265
12194. there was brush and stands of pine that no grass could grow	under and places so steep that cattle wouldn't stop to graze.	8.703052026935532
12195. there was an artificial lake just out of sight in	the first stand of trees fed by a half dozen springs that popped out	of the ground above the hillside orchard.	0.0
12196. yes there was plenty of water	too much and that was probably the trouble.	9.55764918183988
12197. there were tracks	of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres.	9.37400426923309
12198. the first	part of the road was steep but it leveled off after the second bend and	curled gradually into the valley.	8.4004536701202
12199. it was hotter once they reached	the flat and drier but the grass was better.	8.595594853566553
12200. a warm breeze played across	it moving it like waves.	9.59560366773705
12201. a red-tailed hawk flew in behind them	and stayed there watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might	stir up from the side of the road.	6.561377494787317
12202. it took them an hour before they came	to the first houses of kelseyville.	10.801089117890836
12203. the town was about what	wilson expected: one main street with its rows of false-fronted	buildings a water tower a few warehouses a single hotel; all dusty	and sunbaked.	5.21918360651743
12204. such was my state of mind that i did not question the possibility	of	this; under the circumstances i was only too willing to confess all.	8.091663412205813
12205. i was nearly thirty at the time.	11.74036724649576
12206. i went to the hall in the	afternoons only on these preliminary matters.	11.189882844197793
12207. it was dark and i sensed	very large; only the counter at one end was lighted by a long	fluorescent tube suspended directly above it.	6.502999082036729
12208. sometimes i was aware	of people moving about in the darkness.	12.150969996172167
12209. i would turn away from my	writing	in the hope of getting a good look at them but i never quite succeeded.	7.6486672499380095
12210. a glimpse of three of four vague figures at the most.	9.258857116347524
12211. squatting as if waiting.	9.625903376260457
12212. the pulsing glow of	a cigarette.	13.848082117783294
12213. since they could see me but i not them their presence	in the hall disturbed me.	7.277664389987489
12214. the clerk paid them no attention.	12.435529358277208
12215. this impressed	me until i realized how limited was his sphere of influence.	6.954879689604739
12216. his job simply consisted in registering new men.	9.631463447962453
12217. when the phone rang	he answered it.	12.937051705538712
12218. his authority extended to the far edge of the counter	no further.	11.743185007180887
12219. none of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak	to him.	10.656623881673069
12220. baldness was attacking his pate.	10.472119682746735
12221. he spoke to me in a gruff	voice an affectation which quite belied his personality.	7.303218157515648
12222. he wore	his white shirt open at the neck revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest	underneath.	9.665179448550838
12223. it was obvious that he wished himself different from the	sort of person he thought he was.	9.75424785302504
12224. but it was not easy for him and he	often slipped.	23.231851472990158
12225. when one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the	floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle i noticed how the	clerk winced.	7.68961368661108
12226. i felt certain he was really a spineless little man.	10.227318669010717
12227. his hat hung on a hook on the wall and	underneath it i could see his tie knotted ready to be slipped over	his head a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to	have left his neck.	5.155986784899988
12228. the morning's tabloids were on the counter and	a stack of dog-eared men's magazines.	9.425587732110527
12229. on a shelf in the office behind	the counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station which	broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular music.	6.107775289493932
12230. everything	about the clerk was trivial.	10.472119682746735
12231. once pressing him i learned that his	job was only part-time in the afternoons when nothing went on in the	hall.	6.085239817428627
12232. noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps	and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person.	6.482882632975171
12233. with distaste i saw him assume a pompous air.	8.19042451245208
12234. when he saw me coming	he turned his radio off.	14.010139104510168
12235. he made a show of rearranging my forms on	the shelf.	10.823522173964337
12236. he would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence	then bark into it with gruff importance.	9.829693031877651
12237. what limited knowledge he	possessed he forced upon me.	8.725541529919292
12238. in the mornings i was informed fluorescent	tubes similar to the one above the counter illuminated the entire	hall.	9.761050036404082
12239. they and the two large fans which i could dimly see as	daylight filtered through their vents down at the far end of the hall	could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office.	6.089485078103391
12240. he	pointed out the switch to me and for a moment i foolishly believed	that he would let deed follow words.	8.561135228634843
12241. i was shown instead a batch of	white tickets of the sort handed out he told me every morning.	8.718105339421161
12242. now	here was something of obvious importance to me yet when i reached	for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand.	6.290129093830134
12243. he couldn't afford	to have anyone mess around with them he said.	6.401007052155879
12244. each of those tickets	was of great value to its rightful recipient.	10.322795302890796
12245. later i would remember what this pompous little man had told me about	the worth of a ticket.	5.776112937550153
12246. having nothing else to do except wait	for my forms to be processed i gave myself over to speculations concerning	the hall itself.	6.608561366147926
12247. when suitably lighted what would it look like?	9.055853309868477
12248. 	the presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the	hall could become crowded for air.	8.686202664218705
12249. one afternoon upon receiving permission	and the necessary instructions from the clerk i had visited	the toilet adjoining the hall.	6.159966303489678
12250. by counting the number of stalls and	urinals i attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall	would hold at one time.	7.4594467463534
12251. for although i had crossed a corner of the	hall on my way to the toilet i still could not tell for sure how far	to the rear the darkness extended.	6.1097525980689635
12252. i could observe the two fans down	at the end but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long	as i had no measure of comparison.	7.350594465183244
12253. i had for some time been hoping	in vain for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and	myself.	8.613603075580809
12254. i knew that three or four of them were almost always present	in the hall but what they were doing and exactly where i could not	tell.	9.203810128863353
12255. it was i felt possible that they were men who having received no	tickets for that day had remained in the hall to sleep perhaps in	the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light.	6.460928090166492
12256. this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall and my eyes	were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through	the fan vents when i tried to pick out whatever might be lying or	squatting on the floor below.	6.842961066950583
12257. also the clerk appeared to disapprove	of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder.	6.573175611438736
12258. no sooner would	i turn my head away from the counter before he would address me at	times quite sharply in order to bring back my attention.	8.339921044514817
12259. and i had	hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion	when the lights in that place like the hall lights controlled from	the switch in the office flicked off and on impatiently.	5.793379141265374
12260. this sort	of petty vigilance annoyed me.	12.83916464908928
12261. i felt certain it was self-appointed.	10.981588546931944
12262. it sprang from a type of mentality i'd encountered often enough but	certainly had not expected to find here.	9.16662892550264
12263. i decided to see no more of	the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed.	7.079044817757014
12264. i	felt strongly attached to the hall however and hardly a day passed when	i did not go to look at it from a distance.	8.363135560274381
12265. i lived in a state of	suspense because of it.	10.291980138524453
12266. i could not cling to my past nor did i wish	to.	11.600000485126305
12267. i had signed it off on the forms.	10.865611456511958
12268. my future lay solely with the	hall yet what did i know about the hall at this point?	7.040574914466818
12269.  although	i had been inside it i had not yet seen it functioning.	6.243930524020066
12270. i wished to	prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes i ought to	be wearing.	8.954214580296332
12271. i did not despair however; far from it! i was constantly	searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall.	6.686641483035892
12272. though	only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town	its character was wholly foreign to me.	6.44893033609597
12273. large warehouses flanked the	street on which the hall fronted.	7.58069280422349
12274. the river was only a few blocks away	but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it.	8.326723403680983
12275. sometimes	i noticed the tops of ships' masts and funnels reaching above the	pier roofs.	5.84660975948877
12276. the sounds issuing from beyond- winches whirring men	shouting- indicated great activity and excited me.	8.086542342015262
12277. the hall on the	other hand appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront	afternoons.	7.226639403582978
12278. it resembled nothing i'd ever seen before.	14.718704829380005
12279. its front	was windowless but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication	that windows now blinded had once looked out upon the street.	5.324825508063031
12280. i	kept circling the block hoping to see from the street behind it the	rear of the hall.	7.123311798911028
12281. but it was not a tall structure and other buildings	concealed it.	15.016478270492904
12282. for weeks i wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses	and garages truck terminals and taxi repair shops gasoline pumps	and longshoremen's lunch counters yet never did i cease to feel	myself a stranger there.	6.535004649846883
12283. i returned to the hall despite my dislike	for the clerk.	9.260181761627793
12284. as i had expected he insisted that my visits	to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application.	10.526621146616572
12285. meanwhile spring had passed well into summer.	7.798858451394669
12286. at last when i put	it to him directly the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my	case was unusual.	9.838910130836346
12287. when i asked him what if anything i could do about	it he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall.	8.452309825922159
12288. i could consult this personage on any weekday morning though not before	ten o'clock.	9.905375629458117
12289. the clerk impressed this upon me: that i should	not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock.	6.040227447879625
12290. when i went for my interview	with the director i saw why.	11.08122135630587
12291. although it was dark as usual i	could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people.	7.749725701357577
12292. cigarette butts littered the floor.	10.472119682746735
12293. the big fans were going drawing	from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drifted about	in pale strata underneath the ceiling.	5.611360554217259
12294. i had felt the draft they were	making while mounting the stairs.	11.126231026356198
12295. the staircase itself seemed still	to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men.	6.578982329721101
12296. i stopped by the counter.	15.711603260075847
12297. no one was behind it but in the rear wall of the office i noticed	for the first time a door which had been left partially open.	7.2937943234420315
12298. past it i could see part of a desk a flag in a corner a rug on	the floor.	8.636528248237447
12299. i rapped my knuckles on the counter.	9.95288923829895
12300. the director came to the door.	19.45952510366148
12301. i was at once disappointed although	just what i had expected him to look like i could not have explained.	7.91279782448371
12302. he was a man in his late forties with graying hair of medium	height; he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit brown silk	tie and green-tinted soft collar.	9.208313576982482
12303. he wore perforated white-topped	shoes;	they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance	routine any moment.	6.767864846646179
12304. but he came toward me sedately enough showed	me around the counter offered me a seat inside his office then walked	to a file cabinet and got out my application.	7.265985789686624
12305. i had the impression	that he had read my forms perhaps several times.	9.261922647940567
12306. he did not look	at them now.	21.76456148840094
12307. as he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk i wondered	what this dapper slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to	do with the workings of the hall.	5.932474290939318
12308. he spoke in a voice as immaculate	as his appearance.	12.007365624449713
12309. why had i registered?	14.31060311472704
12310.  begging my pardon he	must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying	at the hall.	6.928248950019972
12311. he had looked over my forms and was impressed by	what he had seen there; indeed my scholastic qualifications were such	that he a college graduate himself must envy me them.	5.571642275093166
12312. was i sure	he asked that i knew what i was applying for?	8.375504646178372
12313.  what sort of men	i would come into contact with at the hall?	9.56507048826924
12314.  these questions did	not surprise	me; i felt certain that the director like the afternoon clerk	seldom moved beyond the counter that the hall to them was a jungle	a dark and unwelcome place.	6.562191924007718
12315. though i doubted that he would understand	me i told the director my motives for applying.	7.0153260198939495
12316. i had always i	said hankered after working hard with my hands.	11.126231026356198
12317. this desire i went	on growing voluble as my conviction was aroused had mounted at such	a rate recently that i now found its realization necessary not only	to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing.	5.232634001503675
12318. to this effect i	had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence.	8.62587172710785
12319. the flat hard cap was small but he thrust it to the back of his head.	7.767625229937203
12320. hell with it.	13.148092146312546
12321. before	they could guess his intention rankin stepped forward and swung the	guard's own gun against the uncovered head hard.	5.15576524365156
12322. the man went over	without sound falling to the bare floor.	11.712284366933911
12323. barton said harshly	why did you do that?	7.14162538120728
12324.    rankin sneered at him.	11.568363037656766
12325. what	did you want me to do kiss him?	7.446893647681135
12326.  he dumped me in solitary twice.	13.671139498061125
12327. barton caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung him	around.	6.460370037324521
12328. let's get one thing straight you and me.	7.472039264896897
12329. the	only reason we brought you was to get miller out.	6.728596852024254
12330. if you ever try anything	without my orders i'll kill you.	13.396989096021509
12331. fred rankin looked	at him.	9.118533821976325
12332. it seemed to barton that the green eyes mocked him the	thin-lipped smile held insolence but he had no time to waste now.	9.467835090486789
12333. they filed out through the	guard-room door into the paved square.	7.728847218742062
12334. there were three other men within	this prison whom barton would have liked to liberate but they	were in other cell blocks.	9.254608812752089
12335. they moved slowly toward	the main gate following the wall.	8.175689281675892
12336. they had	chosen this night purposely.	14.714773213271867
12337. they reached the guard house without alerting	the men on the walls above and powers slipped through the door.	6.381100142593491
12338. two men were on duty inside playing pinochle relaxed.	10.954585055389993
12339. they	looked up in surprise as powers came in.	6.764147616291221
12340. what are you doing	out of the block?	16.859102142377616
12341.    it's curtiss he said naming	the man rankin had hit.	3.092413983030036
12342. i've got to have help.	6.1280579316837445
12343. the sergeant in charge climbed to his feet.	8.341215694113531
12344. what's wrong with him?	8.523590111096883
12345.    he's having some kind	of a fit.	4.121739274801433
12346. the sergeant turned to the door.	15.09908895130595
12347. as he passed through	it barton shoved his gun against the man's side.	8.23315565584684
12348. one	sound and you're dead.	11.568363037656766
12349. powers had	not followed.	10.363724110347151
12350. powers was covering the remaining guard.	9.670406878971576
12351. the man half-reached	for the cord of the alarm bell.	9.900138948499714
12352. powers knocked his arm aside.	10.472119682746735
12353. deliberately with none of rankin's viciousness he laid the barrel	of his gun alongside the guard's head.	5.326519577128725
12354. even barton could not quite believe it.	11.783128185031327
12355. it had gone without a hitch.	17.177395146583414
12356. they slid through the wicket in the big gate ghosted across the dark	ground.	9.135986244447125
12357. five minutes later they reached the horses.	9.37082001757008
12358. barton was relieved	to see that carl dill and emmett foster had brought extra mounts.	7.032105024464237
12359. he had been worried that with miller and rankin added to the	escape party they would be short.	8.026604682632193
12360. they walked	the horses heading along the river barton and emmett foster in	the lead seven men riding quietly through the night.	7.231737476099396
12361. the only	thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform	of prison guards three the striped suits of convicts.	6.003004281647442
12362. in a small grove against the river they halted turning	deep into the protection of the trees.	9.313837693294142
12363. foster had brought extra clothing	also.	8.254441635698543
12364. he had been one of the original night	riders one who had escaped the trial.	14.344640406156033
12365. it was to him that barton	had sent carl dill on dill's release from the prison.	9.231756408456198
12366. clyde	miller was crying softly to himself shedding his striped suit	and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants the worn brown shirt.	6.365727389270327
12367. kid boyd was unusually silent rankin watchful a few paces apart.	6.136062553413316
12368. barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to powers.	7.879513779734377
12369. i won't even try to thank you.	7.8674961494772395
12370. the ex-prison guard	was embarrassed.	15.841500723885778
12371. he said in a studied voice i didn't do it for	you.	11.49446894685808
12372. i did it for the valley.	18.799867226563126
12373. you're the only man the night riders	will follow.	6.692094571302032
12374. we've been starving and i don't like to starve.	5.635497662279574
12375. barton turned away his eyes falling upon rankin beside	his horse.	6.210871206873012
12376. the murderer lifted his head.	13.848082117783294
12377. meaning you want me to ride out?	7.14162538120728
12378.    you aren't	one of us.	20.025453829488345
12379. there's nothing for you here.	4.675983334456371
12380. i got no place	to go.	15.711603260075847
12381. he did not trust rankin his	violent temper his killer instinct.	11.086617814195742
12382. but ten years in prison had taught	him realities.	11.89315510008271
12383. they were in a fight outweighed in both numbers and	money.	10.760865119841403
12384. it was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses to	call them night riders to set out to attack the largest mining combination	the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure.	8.381270675103593
12385. but	if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals men who	knew how to use a gun against men who would match the killers on the	other side.	5.246980644258727
12386. your choice he said briefly and turned to	kid boyd.	10.587434711329745
12387. bury those uniforms so they won't be found.	6.764147616291221
12388. then barton touched carl dill's arm and moved off up the river	bank.	8.543109428536168
12389. he wanted a careful uninterrupted report from dill on the	conditions in the valley.	7.952839862706998
12390. they squatted on their heels in the	deep mud and dill found a cigar in his breast pocket passing it over	silently.	7.231737476099396
12391. he too knew the agony of going for weeks sometimes months	without the solace of tobacco.	6.767092837476563
12392. mitchell barton drew in the fragrance	deeply letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat	for a moment before he exhaled.	6.9266443514590685
12393. through the gloom he could not	see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly.	7.1242553310960535
12394. for his	first five years in prison they had shared a cell.	10.052113232822672
12395. carl dill	was neither a rancher nor a valley man.	6.460370037324521
12396. he had been the auditor for	the mining syndicate and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the	syndicate's money.	11.192338752187542
12397. he had done time for the theft.	14.42843394665355
12398. the one	thing they had in common was their hatred.	9.945332631078985
12399. it had drawn them together and since his release from prison dill	had worked tirelessly to effect this night's escape.	6.994497311889883
12400. he	said	now i've got the perfect headquarters set up.	8.581436094141479
12401. mitch barton knew the place.	8.254441635698543
12402. twenty years before	a group of easterners had bought out the haskell claims in the rocky	hills south of grass valley.	7.929956930720631
12403. they had spent a million dollars carving	in a road putting up buildings drilling their haulage tunnel.	7.384927036101855
12404. then	the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned.	8.9524274349772
12405. the road's washed badly said dill but there's a	trail you can get over with a horse.	5.909825399783732
12406. a company of cavalry couldn't	come in there if two men were guarding that trail.	8.788088360761813
12407. how do the valley people feel?	12.581099690444626
12408.    as mad as ever.	18.01708567881216
12409. but kruger's men keep them off balance and they don't trust	me.	5.612732558018799
12410. when they learn you're in the hills though	they'll rally don't worry about that.	10.110661561521283
12411. barton waited	for a long moment then asked the question which lay always uppermost	in his mind.	5.427950274147271
12412. did you find him?	17.171912493159287
12413.    dill	was silent as if he hated to answer and barton had a cold sick feeling	of apprehension.	6.051818343124361
12414. barton half-straightened in surprise.	11.568363037656766
12415. what's he doing	there?	7.4788191822552905
12416.    again dill hesitated.	17.44209166126226
12417. dealing faro?	12.292407525564322
12418.  how come?	23.90221720139551
12419.    your sister-in-law has	the faro bank in cap ayres' saloon.	7.0413287261957445
12420. barton cursed under	his breath.	11.568363037656766
12421. after another long pause he asked how many people	know who they are?	7.377288161736213
12422.    everyone.	19.804021762487697
12423. your cousin finley saw	to that.	9.347724754445679
12424. he's quite a rat you know.	5.229105600568654
12425. he sold out to kruger's men.	10.776005861178222
12426. he's informed them of everything you've ever written him.	5.107476066452653
12427. barton stood up.	10.363724110347151
12428. he said tensely all	right.	27.577776874074
12429. let's go get the boy.	6.376515073648512
12430. dill had come up also.	10.472119682746735
12431. i	was afraid of this.	9.118533821976325
12432. i almost didn't tell you.	15.711603260075847
12433. if	you hadn't i'd have killed you.	10.230302394263456
12434. but you can't ride into the ferry.	15.40953913658233
12435. that's what they'll	expect you to do.	4.013884467057159
12436. they'll be there waiting for you.	6.857683493612344
12437. i understand	how you feel about the child h.	9.169644675936961
12438. barton's	voice was rougher than dill had ever heard it.	8.196044167676531
12439. my wife died in childbirth after i was sent away.	7.166085718054756
12440. i	can't leave him there.	11.568363037656766
12441. donald kruger would like nothing better	than to hold him as hostage and i wouldn't entrust a snake to his	tender care.	5.0176589645046334
12442. i've got to get the boy.	7.89214839617644
12443. two	barton's men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen	places carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult.	5.083242045036259
12444. it	was over an hour before their escape was discovered but still the	news that barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state.	6.839868556728676
12445. it reached donald kruger in his massive home in burlingame.	9.093323993376403
12446. it reached the mines at north san juan and bloomfield.	11.536380215083017
12447. it	brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences.	7.370986955910962
12448. for everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg and	mitchell barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence.	7.209967499685006
12449. creighton hague sat in his office above the ione pit.	6.925319829210522
12450. the	office was of logs four rooms each heated by an iron stove.	7.391013650626644
12451. the	building was dwarfed by the scene outside.	7.14162538120728
12452. there a dozen giant monitors	played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam	of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside.	8.771042783857961
12453. the gravel was	the bed of an ancient river buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of	earth.	6.524665880839762
12454. it was partially cemented by ages and pressure yet it crumpled	before the onslaught of the powerful streams the force of a thousand	fire hoses and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices.	8.6494200419816
12455. a million dollars' of gold a month.	8.604265568338976
12456. a million tons of rock	and soil and brush.	11.835719755731208
12457. the monitors ran twenty-four hours each day.	8.976097203071156
12458. their roar like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could	be heard for miles.	8.566552179474249
12459. hague like all who worked near the pits was partly	deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums.	5.236383152695367
12460. he	was a big man wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill	air.	7.449639826257348
12461. fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt.	6.929534989480969
12462. ten years older	than mitch barton he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits	to manager of the operation.	7.868923777098013
12463. he was proud of his accomplishments	proud of his job proud that donald kruger and his associates trusted	him.	7.500867793067318
12464. he lived and breathed for the mining company.	14.664240474129224
12465. no	man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless and	hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life.	5.3227733462713
12466. there	came a ghost of noise at the office door and hague swung to see kodyke	in the entrance from the outer room.	7.035735924163798
12467. hague had never accustomed	himself to kodyke.	7.622507342753323
12468. the man was tall thin with a narrow face and	a too-large nose.	11.580778186661524
12469. the eyes always held hague eyes of a dead man lidless	as a lizard's with the fixed intensity of a cobra.	6.81200992812806
12470. even hague	was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was kodyke.	9.686402124987813
12471. he knew nothing about the man's history.	13.251792314754383
12472. kodyke had appeared at the	mine one day bearing a letter from kruger.	8.191338403514786
12473. kodyke was to head the	dread company police.	7.14162538120728
12474. he ran the change rooms.	15.385132030882776
12475. he threw out the hi-graders.	15.176102750796224
12476. he supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw	gold which each week went out to san francisco.	8.043137872714693
12477. hague squeezed	down his uneasy dislike.	8.254441635698543
12478. he pulled open the top drawer of his desk	and drew out a tintype.	9.574611628192725
12479. he broke	out of folsom last night.	10.776005861178222
12480. apparently he bribed one of the guards.	15.16922189857847
12481. we want him back there or we want him dead.	9.565948447780118
12482. kodyke took the	picture in a lean hand studying it thoughtfully.	7.879513779734377
12483. you know how the ranchers in the	valley are.	12.448818652057222
12484. they blame us for all their troubles.	12.562672915688301
12485. ten years ago they	blew up some of our ditches.	0.0
12486. it cost us a hundred thousand dollars	and thirty days lost time to fix them.	10.07744747749777
12487. we don't want barton's night	riders loose again.	6.222406585790925
12488. the gunman nodded slipping the picture	into his breast pocket saying nothing.	9.005093323721033
12489. normally hague	wasted no words but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although	he knew kodyke was aware of all he said.	5.044170728672143
12490. if she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother she	did not comment upon it.	12.036637997748727
12491. after they had finished eating melissa	took sprite the kitten under her arm- so that auntie grace	can teach it about the whistle- and climbed into the station wagon	beside her mother.	5.4240751850323425
12492. she had offered to walk but pamela knew she	would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided	her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called	auntie.	7.3741466311825885
12493. when they reached their neighbor's house pamela	said a few polite words to grace and kissed melissa lightly on	the forehead the impulse prompted by a stray thought- of the type	to which she was frequently subject these days- that they might never	see one another again.	5.270237877983819
12494. then she turned the station wagon around and	headed it back down the hill with the village as her ostensible destination.	8.078360846807618
12495. as she drove she thought about her plan.	10.390455524726253
12496. it was really	quite simple.	31.04425555256091
12497. so simple in fact that it might even work- although	pamela now in her new frame of mind was careful not to pretend	too much assurance.	6.9690037898749155
12498. that mistake she thought had cost her dearly	these past few days and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of	the traps that the mountain might set for her.	6.624813052276481
12499. she must be cautious	so as not to alert the scheming forest.	7.408104725819052
12500. when the station wagon	drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the culver	house pamela turned the wheel guiding the car to its familiar	parking spot close to the house and stopped.	8.308434680995507
12501. all of her movements	were careful and methodical partaking of the stealth of a criminal who	has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which	step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime.	6.229464986401441
12502. she locked the ignition removed the keys stepped out of the car and	went into the house.	9.321038103525812
12503. here she dropped the keys on a small table beside	the door and went upstairs to her bedroom.	6.111329052248312
12504. on her bureau lay	a small brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving- an	object which pamela believed now had been the property of her	great-grandfather	major hiram munroe culver.	7.437036735943127
12505. he had belonged to this	land and perhaps had desecrated it- and this was the only material	symbol that remained of him.	8.204833774983959
12506. if she pamela were being held responsible	for his crimes then hers must be the final act of expiation.	8.8808475145664
12507. she	would return this symbol to the mountain as one pours seed back into	the soil every spring h or as ancient fertility cults demand annual	human sacrifice.	4.921538323043143
12508. slowly and thoughtfully she slipped the	ornament into the pocket of her slacks moved down the stairs and out	of the house.	6.365727389270327
12509. there was only one place where the mountain might receive	her- that unnamed unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom.	8.393609162359732
12510. atonement if atonement were possible could only be made at that sacred	sacrificial basin.	7.60500898731464
12511. it was there that she would have to enact her	renunciation beg forgiveness.	15.242274435948202
12512. perhaps it was insane pamela	thought.	15.551251131047142
12513. perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream.	9.877802848476074
12514. but she was	caught in it and she faced the terrible possibility that if it were	a dream it was one from which she might never awaken.	7.595942671108817
12515. facing	the forest now she who had not dared to enter it before walked between	two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction	of the pool.	4.656645272807095
12516. she remembered little of her previous journey there with	grace and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission	would enable her to accomplish it.	6.636813461700928
12517. the forest was open and freely	welcoming extending an enchanted hand.	7.43304005989246
12518. the ground was covered with	soft pine needles and the slope was gentle.	9.385757099577065
12519. birds chirped and chattered	in the trees and the sun all dewy-eyed and soft caressed her shoulders	warmly from time to time.	5.985983713706106
12520. it was not thought pamela such	an evil place after all.	16.28067559941205
12521. no wonder melissa responded so completely to	its beckoning.	8.595555349266164
12522. perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees	that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed.	8.754431690808206
12523. was it not	possible after all that the forest was in league with her and her	child h that its sympathy lay with the culvers h that she had erred	in failing to understand this?	5.538415058925673
12524.    pamela felt calm and peaceful	as she walked along.	8.581436094141479
12525. the slight flutter that had disturbed the motion	of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now and even the	dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken	her fear.	4.835545431085908
12526. she regarded them as signs that she was nearing the	glen she sought and she was glad to at last be doing something positive	in her unenunciated undefined struggle with the mountain and its	darkling inhabitants.	6.787905576134926
12527. having persisted too long in deliberate	ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her pamela was relieved	now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward	grappling with them.	5.555224606892063
12528. a few days ago she would have thought such an	expedition as this utterly ridiculous; today on the contrary it	seemed utterly reasonable.	8.910253278868163
12529. she did not pause to consider what	she would do if her plan should fail; she directed all of her mental	and physical energy toward achieving this one goal.	5.376517630488616
12530. if as she walked	her steps fumbled from time to time she chose to ignore that omen.	9.719070621055401
12531. if the slope grew steeper and the groves more dim she tried not to	heed.	7.716171661448851
12532. success depended upon maintaining her equanimity; she must be	poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that	she was in earnest.	6.963567000839393
12533. the forest took on an impersonal aspect.	8.976097203071156
12534. it did not care what sort of person prowled its woods plucked at its	bark or stripped the berries from its bushes.	9.57125167940666
12535. unconcerned indifferent	unmotivated the forest was simply there- fighting man's depredations	with more abundant growth and man's follies with its own musical	evening laughter.	5.1935703684273
12536. red man or white man pacifist or killer the	forest would accept them all- knowing that it could thrive equally	well on slaughter and beneficence; knowing that its ageless mass would	always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man.	6.309971546584139
12537. she must not think about time.	10.451197814660853
12538. that was another	one of those traps.	16.04604357945442
12539. in her grim pursuit of tranquillity pamela	focused her thoughts on her husband.	7.997980573544702
12540. if when this was all over she	found the words to tell him about it she wondered if he would ever	understand.	9.32400447357015
12541. how could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent?	8.652991609428083
12542. 	indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights nor would his	days be haunted by the dimly-outlined ill-conceived figure of her	benighted ancestor.	6.290129093830134
12543. his bright daylight mind would whistle away such	images; they would not dare to face his scoffing.	5.995475902037606
12544. pamela was	glad jim was nowhere near.	9.670406878971576
12545. his presence would have interfered with	her duty.	8.100034263261762
12546. the mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once	or twice on the smooth pine needles.	8.086542342015262
12547. the trees huddled more closely together	their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against	the sun.	6.293964813708376
12548. bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours	for the	struggling stranger and without the direct light of the sun to	act as compass pamela could no longer be positive of her direction.	6.938698384977444
12549. nevertheless she continued to move upward.	8.930589264239343
12550. she was sure she	would reach the pool by climbing and she clung to that belief despite	the increasing number of obstacles.	9.274900997225007
12551. the forest had become an alien	world where she strove alone unprotected unguided to deal with whatever	hindrances were offered.	6.316811857912978
12552. it was a bold dark castle of pine boughs	that stood like a medieval fortress eclipsing the sun and human	time.	10.911473353290813
12553. at one and the same time she was within it but still searching	for the drawbridge that would give her entry.	9.217613608887323
12554. silence came into	the forest- a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring	mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees.	6.09983039226678
12555. silence	walked at pamela's side its presence numbingly close yet too far	for her to hear.	5.542917982132687
12556. silence stood in front of her waiting and in back	of her blocking her retreat.	0.0
12557. she stumbled over the root of a	tree that protruded maliciously above the earth.	6.652099300943592
12558. in spite of her attempt	to preserve her balance she fell bruising her arm on a naked stone.	9.42323694515568
12559. for a moment she could not catch her breath and then her breath	returning in short frightened spasms she lifted herself to her feet	laboriously.	6.711220066620575
12560. she started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her	clothes.	9.174705629782341
12561. her arm bled slightly and the offended skin cried out in	pain.	6.6158785931347355
12562. she was bewildered.	24.933130579944567
12563. she seemed to	have come such a long distance- too far for her destination which had	wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees.	5.712086826504732
12564. she stood	quite still trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn a	path to follow a clue to guide her.	7.934426622250684
12565. she was standing in a thick	grove.	12.173221674601228
12566. the trees were crowded so closely together that their branches	overlapped virtually shutting out the sun completely.	7.984931715199298
12567. the earth	smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived of the cleansing	effect of the sun's rays.	6.022877958625589
12568. she had the feeling that under the mouldering	leaves there would be the bodies of dead animals quietly decaying	and giving their soil back to the mountain.	10.014631744810153
12569. the thought	made pamela shudder.	12.486750257698887
12570. a terrible chill swept through the grove.	11.827351117541651
12571. not	a breeze exactly but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome	familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove catching pamela	in a leering embrace.	4.726707772215755
12572. there was a peculiar density about it a thick	substance that could be sensed but never identified never actually perceived.	10.869852396962234
12573. where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such	a scene?	6.946964478735678
12574.  she already knew this unwholesome chilling atmosphere that	was somehow grotesquely alive.	9.118601195872367
12575. it enclosed her clammy hands and twined	around her ankles.	9.740106390825309
12576. it crept into the open neck of her blouse and	slid down her body seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores	of her skin.	7.625115890758028
12577. it crawled across her breasts suffocating the life	in her nipples.	9.093323993376403
12578. it circled her thighs exploring with its icy tentacles.	12.356930286633146
12579. it entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus and	its particles spreading creeping crawling joined themselves into	steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached; stifled	her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps; clutched her	throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was	dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched	together in the rigid fixture of her jaws.	4.411613550138971
12580. she had to	get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid	of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain depriving her	of reason and sight.	6.755733737717024
12581. but she did not know which way to go.	11.324119162033224
12582. the shadows	of the trees engulfed her foreclosing every possible exit from the	grove.	8.649006242526841
12583. she had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around	her throat in ever-tightening circles.	7.214144876120245
12584. she could not scream	for even if a sound could take shape within her parched mouth who	would hear who would listen?	7.912839110350198
12585.    does the mountain listen?	17.348768528854634
12586. 	pamela groped blindly.	13.148092146312546
12587. she had to move in	some direction- any direction that would take her away from this evil	place.	6.72085158041825
12588. she thrust forward through the shadows and the trees	that resisted her and tried to fling her back.	8.308546745949068
12589. her own body protested	aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed where cold	demon wisps still clung and caressed.	5.456583468166927
12590. every movement she made	seemed unnecessarily noisy.	10.862955806594185
12591. twigs cracked loudly under her feet;	bushes swished and scratched at her slacks; tree branches snapped	as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her.	4.903693293796623
12592. miraculously she found exactly the right statement.	9.060328853487057
12593. she began	it deliberately so that none of her words would be lost on him.	6.838637835166906
12594. i want to tell you something thomas demontez lord.	16.339971390176892
12595. i'm	well aware that you've got a pedigree as long as my leg and that i	don't amount to anything.	5.772711849498982
12596. but-   but it don't matter	a-tall lord supplied fondly.	8.581436094141479
12597. to me you'll always be the	girl o' my dreams an' the sweetest flower that grows.	6.6194456494230725
12598. beaming	idiotically he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her.	7.615092762846159
12599. she yanked away from him furiously.	13.569464846992485
12600. you shut up! shu-tt	up-pp! i've got something to say to you and by god you're	going to listen.	9.4308832102143
12601. do you hear me?	18.895468921462953
12602.  you're going to listen!	lord nodded agreeably.	7.844415954402442
12603. he said he wanted very much to listen.	18.168535834383384
12604. he knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would	be plumb important as well as pleasin' to the ear and he didn't	want to miss a word of it.	8.576781370730249
12605. so would she mind speaking a little louder?	8.318581492070866
12606. 	i think you stink tom lord! i think you're mean	and hateful and stupid and- louder?	6.886249538313906
12607.  said joyce.	17.401135049171184
12608. so i can hear you while i'm checkin' the car.	11.785677815836154
12609. looks	like we might be in for a speck of trouble.	7.919314171953995
12610. he opened the	door and got out.	13.671139498061125
12611. he waited at the car side for a moment looking down	at her expectantly.	8.197648113411155
12612. well?	19.804021762487697
12613.  wasn't you goin' to say	somethin'?	6.654449620674362
12614.  then helpfully as she merely stared at him in weary	silence maybe you could write it down for me huh?	7.132676557160586
12615.  print it	in real big letters an' i can cipher it out later.	5.825820622377272
12616. aah	go on she said.	11.568363037656766
12617. just go the hell on.	11.04184642448208
12618. he grinned	nodded and walked around to the front of the car.	12.959864699184015
12619. lips pursed mournfully	he stared down at its crazily sagging left side.	6.002446559592496
12620. then he hunkered	down on the heels of his handmade boots peered into the orderly	chaos of axle shock absorber and spring.	7.590710689129504
12621. he went prone on	his stomach the better to pursue his examination.	8.695854432244808
12622. after a time he straightened	again brushing the red permian dust from his hands slapping	it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored twenty-five-dollar	shirt.	7.727222365517492
12623. he wore no gun- a strange ommission for a peace officer	in this country.	7.583885718643907
12624. never he'd once told joyce had he encountered	any man or situation that called for a gun.	7.826826025435942
12625. and he really feels	that way she thought.	11.449466057508422
12626. that's really all he's got all he is.	5.028623875776174
12627. just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package.	8.397515587641191
12628. if	i could make myself feel the same way h   she studied him	hopefully yearningly; against the limitless background of sky and wasteland	it was easy to confirm her analysis.	6.530245932827497
12629. here in the god-forsaken	place the westerly end of nowhere tom lord looked almost insignificant	almost contemptible.	8.45647437626577
12630. he was handsome with his coal-black	hair and eyes his fine-chiseled features.	11.186713371780234
12631. but she'd known	plenty of handsomer guys and conceding his good looks what was there	left?	6.890168758778995
12632.  he wasn't a big man; rather on the medium side.	10.090191208524187
12633. neither	was he very powerful of build.	7.622507342753323
12634. he could move very quickly she knew	but he was more wiry than	truly strong.	9.833131466668718
12635. and his relatively small hands and feet gave him an	almost delicate appearance.	7.641549371017116
12636. just nothing she told herself.	14.00840206751307
12637. just so darned sure of himself that he puts the indian sign on	everyone.	6.6191958684901975
12638. but by gosh i want him and i'm going to have him!	he caught her eye came back around the car with the boot-wearer's	teetering half-mincing walk.	8.243224909250143
12639. why did these yokels still wear	boots anyway when most had scarcely sat a horse in years?	6.7303460180559105
12640.  he	slid in at her side tucked a cigar into his mouth and politely proffered	one to her.	6.757567981697296
12641. oh cut it out tom! she snapped.	8.196452441250985
12642. can't	you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute?	8.696899461830299
12643. 	this ain't your brand maybe lord suggested.	7.14162538120728
12644. or maybe	you just don't feel like a cigar?	9.846393082123427
12645.    i feel like getting	back to town that's what i feel like! now are you going to take	me or am i supposed to walk?	6.355571740902188
12646.    might get there faster	walkin' lord drawled seein' as how i got a busted front	spring.	7.555646014287481
12647. on the other hand howsomever maybe you wouldn't either.	15.21397025278346
12648. i figger it's probl'y a sixty-five-mile walk and i c'n maybe	get this spring patched up in a couple of hours.	9.125774742550359
12649. how-	with what?	12.292407525564322
12650.  there's nothing out here but rattlesnakes.	5.798444109528978
12651. now ain't it the truth?	10.622662447258575
12652.  lord laughed with secret amusement.	10.472119682746735
12653. not a danged thing but rattlesnakes so i reckon i'll get	the boss rattler to help me.	6.630932335438428
12654. tom! for god's sake!	looky.	11.568363037656766
12655. he pointed cutting her off.	17.048342700487726
12656. see	that wildcat?	15.594944937291627
12657.    she saw it then the distant derrick of the	wildcat- a test well in unexplored country.	6.257697475937866
12658. and even with her limited	knowledge of such things she knew that the car could be repaired	there; sufficiently at least to get them back into town.	7.470712716675366
12659. a wildcatter	had to be prepared for almost any emergency.	9.164530179916156
12660. he had to depend on	himself since he was invariably miles and hours away from others.	11.072524664532015
12661. well let's get going she said impatiently.	8.760798157016161
12662. i-	she broke off frowning.	11.568363037656766
12663. what did you mean by that rattlesnake	gag?	9.865657898260363
12664.  getting the boss rattlesnake to help you?	10.113770245223273
12665.    why	i meant what i said lord declared.	7.14162538120728
12666. what else would i mean	anyways?	14.705292966559352
12667.    she looked at him lips compressed.	9.987973641461945
12668. then with	a shrug of pretended indifference she took a compact from her purse	and went through the motions of fixing her make-up.	7.24409085326203
12669. in his mood it	was the best way to handle him; that is to show no curiosity whatsoever.	9.644754093518667
12670. otherwise she would be baited into a tantrum- teased and provoked	until she lost control of herself and thus lost still another battle	in the maddening struggle of tom lord vs joyce lakewood.	6.22707212933008
12671. the car lurched along at a snail's crawl the left-front mudguard	banging and scraping against the tire occasionally scraping against	the road itself.	5.653570330727172
12672. lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering	wheel.	8.936518819505798
12673. he seemed very pleased with himself as though some intricate	scheme was working out exactly as he had planned.	7.554841062732162
12674. along with this	self-satisfaction however joyce sensed a growing tension.	12.670897604273614
12675. it poured	out of him like an electric current a feeling that the muscles and	nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action and that that	action would be all that he anticipated.	5.8388474235566274
12676. joyce had seen him like	this once before- more than once actually but on one particularly	memorable occasion.	7.794217276071636
12677. that was the day that he had practically mopped	up the main street of big sands with aaron mcbride field boss	for the highlands oil + gas company.	6.420323994169083
12678. tom had been laying	for aaron mcbride for a long time just waiting to catch him out of	line.	8.81559499240046
12679. mcbride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with	a pistol on his hip.	5.614905270311928
12680. he had a legitimate reason for wearing it.	15.783697866369657
12681. it	was payday for highlands and he was packing a lot of money back into	the oil fields.	7.660682114954067
12682. moreover as long as the weapon was carried openly	the sheriff's office had made no previous issue of it.	8.897529244959287
12683. so	what's this all about?	9.118533821976325
12684.  he demanded when lord confronted him.	13.671139498061125
12685. i'm not the only man in town with a gun or the only one without	a permit.	5.554526260168297
12686. it was the wrong thing to say.	24.817817777269493
12687. by failing to do	as he was told instantly- to take out a permit or return the gun to	his car- he had played into lord's hands.	5.102732262138841
12688. the trouble was	that he had virtually had to protest.	11.070778695975731
12689. the deputy had forced him to	by his manner of accosting him.	7.098087065137257
12690. so how about it?	15.777064725032243
12691.  he	said.	15.610129252044759
12692. why single me out on this permit deal?	10.476177451418131
12693.    well	i'll tell you about that lord told him.	7.025710106602091
12694. we aim t' be see-lective	y'know?	15.292242212242115
12695.  don't like to bother no one unless we have	to which i figger we do in your case.	3.531277043214802
12696. figger we got to be plumb careful	with any of you highlands big shots.	8.067600489792797
12697. he himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company	but that had nothing to do with him.	10.486068827214773
12698. he was an honest man doing a hard	job and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable.	10.347934786823048
12699. look lord he said hoarsely.	12.50213707625067
12700. i know you've got	a grudge against me and maybe i can't blame you.	10.513599649718829
12701. you think that highlands	swindled you and i helped 'em do it.	8.635404455622542
12702. but you're all wrong	man! i'm no lawyer.	12.934994931595257
12703. i just do what i'm told and-	uh-huh.	11.43943066874867
12704. an' that could mean trouble with a fella that's	workin' for crooks.	7.615092762846159
12705. so you get rid of that pistol right now mis-ter	mcbride.	9.96724273879935
12706. you do that or take you out a permit right now.	10.204085970961833
12707. mcbride couldn't do either of course.	7.622507342753323
12708. not immediately as the	deputy demanded.	14.174471042466617
12709. not without a face-saving respite of at least a few	minutes.	9.512614553525596
12710. to do so would make his job well-nigh impossible.	17.315351865041016
12711. oil-field	workers were a rough-tough lot.	8.254441635698543
12712. how could he exert authority over	them- make them toe the line as he had to- if he knuckled under to	this small-town clown?	8.236063964612867
12713.    i'll get around to it a little	later he mumbled desperately.	4.489674125097363
12714. just as soon as i go to the bank	and-   huh-uh.	18.845036709006845
12715. now mis-ter mcbride said	lord and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss's arm.	6.908404262125645
12716. it was strictly the deputy's game but mcbride had gone	too far to throw in.	10.904928767278548
12717. now he could only play the last card in what was	probably the world's coldest deck.	7.120582936368558
12718. he flung off lord's	hand and attempted to push past him inadvertently shoving him into a	storefront.	8.26265427207832
12719. it was practically the last move that mcbride made	of his own volition.	9.543590119202564
12720. lord slugged him in the stomach so hard	that the organ almost pressed against his spine.	8.305837855719702
12721. then as he doubled	gasping vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten lord straightened	him with an uppercut.	6.080245523647305
12722. a rabbit punch redoubled him.	13.150214475214955
12723. and then	there was a numbing blow to the heart and another gut-flattening blow	to the stomach h   but he couldn't keep up with them.	6.850978010909299
12724. no	more could he defend himself against them.	9.060328853487057
12725. he seemed to be fighting	not one man but a dozen.	13.852442767594633
12726. and he could no longer think of face-saving	of honor but only of escape.	11.413301875505688
12727. why he's going to kill me	he thought wildly.	8.257640091759392
12728. i meant him no harm.	15.711603260075847
12729. i've given willful hurt	to no man.	4.7060581600896745
12730. i was just doing my job just following orders and for	that he's going to kill me.	8.88233119648731
12731. beat me to death in front of a hundred	people.	9.211811328634852
12732. somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was	about to die was the knowledge that lord would probably not suffer for	it: the murder would go unpunished.	6.184916108314838
12733. he mcbride would be cited	as in the wrong and he lord would go scot-free an officer who had	only done his duty though perhaps too energetically.	5.77232259685148
12734. mcbride	staggered into the street flopped sprawling in the stinging dust.	7.879513779734377
12735. fear-maddened fleeing the lengthening shadow of death he scrambled	to his feet again.	5.825820622377272
12736. he couldn't see; he was long past the point of	coherent thinking.	8.120732436992942
12737. dimly he heard laughter hoots of derision but	he could not read the racket properly.	5.542917982132687
12738. he could not grasp that lord	had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago and that his leaden arms were	flailing at nothing but the air.	8.016918159303074
12739. he hated them too much to	understand- the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that	was lord's world.	7.95649079607987
12740. this he was sure was the way they would	act;	laughing at a dying man laughing as a man was beaten to death.	11.555938920427923
12741. and	nothing would be done about it.	11.520289472815193
12742. nothing unless h   donna!	donna his young wife the girl who was both daughter and wife	to him.	7.275524183453504
12743. donna was like he was.	8.254441635698543
12744. she lived by the rules never compromising	never blinded or diverted by circumstance.	9.717881041361755
12745. and donna would-	when he regained consciousness he was in lord's house in	the office of doctor lord the deputy's deceased father.	6.28335140198212
12746. the brannon outfit- known as the slash-b because of its brand-	reached hondo creek before sundown.	9.187215445773132
12747. the herd was watered and	then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's	bedground.	7.743402724301891
12748. two of the new hands a mexican named jose amado and	a kid known only as laredo were picked for the first trick of riding	night herd.	8.79880263180799
12749. the rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and	turned them into the remuda.	11.496269582782043
12750. they got tin cups of coffee from the big	pot on the coosie's fire rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes	lounged about.	7.597894096289312
12751. there was some idle talk a listless discussion of	this or that small happening during the day's drive.	7.935008882650276
12752. but they deliberately	avoided the one subject that had them all curious: the failure	of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit.	8.383202742307288
12753. it especially bothered	the older hands.	14.93623902024112
12754. the cook mateo garcia had arrived	there long before the herd.	9.590970489097785
12755. he'd started a fire and put coffee on	and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon.	5.253148688854877
12756. he was readying	a batch of sourdough biscuits for the dutch oven.	11.186713371780234
12757. supper would be	ready within the hour.	7.622507342753323
12758. the maguire family was setting up a separate	camp nearby.	10.577541549038303
12759. billie had unhitched the mules from both tom brannon's	and his father's wagon.	5.881264192582968
12760. hank had gathered wood for a cookfire	and his wife was busy at it now.	7.091561345451085
12761. conchita kept an eye on the twins	and little elena trying to keep them from falling into the creek	by which they persisted in playing.	5.789094374320955
12762. conchita nagged at the younger children	attempting without success to keep her thoughts off tom brannon.	6.886249538313906
12763. tom brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after	the maguires joined it which had been at midday.	6.063638357639878
12764. he'd come alone	without his wife and child.	10.399760741155912
12765. he'd been in an angry mood: conchita	had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him.	5.3193803264926816
12766. she	wondered what had taken place in town between him and his wife.	7.820032411852366
12767. she	wished that she could talk to her mother about it.	6.574031093057597
12768. not that her mother	knew what had happened but they could speculate upon it.	10.81853401033002
12769. but her	mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it and say that it was none	of her concern.	9.002401220029725
12770. pat get out of that creek! you too sean!	elena you'll get mud all over your dress!   even	as she called to the children conchita let her gaze seek tom brannon.	6.750340761989275
12771. tomas she called him- as the mexican hands did.	6.460370037324521
12772. he was in earnest	conversation with her father and the old vaquero luis hernandez.	15.236420089567975
12773. whatever they are talking about?	10.398566928214342
12774.  conchita wondered.	15.594944937291627
12775. it	bothered her that she probably would never know.	6.764147616291221
12776. certainly she wouldn't	dare ask her father afterward.	10.468926976493425
12777. he would tell her not to pry into	grownups' affairs- as though she were a little kid like elena!	at the moment the three men were not saying much of anything.	6.03973709767245
12778. they were sitting on their heels rider-fashion over by the still	empty calf wagon.	10.525563593228838
12779. brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to	the left rear wheel with the other two facing him.	5.662962320760848
12780. he held a cigarette	in his right hand.	12.411802052220429
12781. it was burning away forgotten.	19.850098703869534
12782. his face was	clouded with unhappiness.	13.684659815100163
12783. he'd told hank maguire and luis	hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what	he now intended to do.	5.140384128378957
12784. they were considering it gravely neither seeming	to like what he planned.	10.25598444397335
12785. finally hernandez said i could	offer you advice tomas but you wouldn't heed it.	6.200559815300634
12786. wait a little while.	11.568363037656766
12787. let senora	brannon live in her father's house for a time.	8.980254005438322
12788. give her time	to miss you.	12.36888204855963
12789. maybe she will then come to you.	8.392121578401147
12790. after all you want the	senora as much as you want the boy.	12.155304659479476
12791. you need her even more than you	need him.	12.586845640305924
12792. she won't change her mind brannon said.	11.583842136067785
12793. john clayton will see to that.	9.659465402451126
12794. but after a time	away from you h.	17.083193885314646
12795. a year luis?	20.465125282850924
12796.  five?	19.804021762487697
12797.  ten?	15.610129252044759
12798.  how	long should i wait?	11.568363037656766
12799.  maybe in a year tomas h.	9.102905270528913
12800. in a year she'll like living in clayton's house too much to	come back to me brannon said flatly.	8.521077216251806
12801. and the boy will be too	much under his influence by then.	8.591794959731292
12802. i've got to take danny away from	clayton before i lose him altogether.	5.467687105191947
12803. hell in a year or five or ten	the boy will have forgotten me- his own father!   but	to take him and leave his mother behind is not good.	4.89557611007094
12804. in	my place you'd follow such advice as you give me?	7.879513779734377
12805.    hernandez	looked suddenly uncertain.	10.363724110347151
12806. that i can't answer for i	can't imagine something like this happening to me.	9.230155681678822
12807. maybe i should	withdraw my advice- no?	9.102905270528913
12808.    brannon looked at hank maguire.	10.472119682746735
12809. and you?	20.11369178488903
12810.  what would you do in my place?	13.044634782666947
12811.    hank	shook his head.	10.363724110347151
12812. like luis i can't see	something like this happening to me.	9.115841268383512
12813. with maria and me there's never	any problem.	9.453274480108805
12814. where i go she goes- and the kids with us.	9.215089054017644
12815. you're	going	to need your woman.	9.118533821976325
12816. and the boy will need his mother.	14.77535634709673
12817. if you take	the one you'd better take both.	12.564315270518218
12818. i won't force beth to come against her will.	8.895618565148425
12819. but i'm going	to have my son.	11.276709257332119
12820. they were silent for a little while each	looking glum.	11.555775202424963
12821. finally luis hernandez said what must be	must be.	7.66975707547012
12822. i am with you of course tomas.	14.894444268829886
12823. and hank maguire	added so am i tom.	9.342113951872065
12824. all right brannon said	rising.	15.807226770847752
12825. we'll ride out as soon as we've had chuck.	5.3605663684237435
12826. brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall.	10.325313308643159
12827. they	had for cover both darkness and a summer storm.	6.460370037324521
12828. during much of the	fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the	sky to the east.	8.415385650455821
12829. later they'd heard the rumble of thunder and then	just outside rockfork they ran into rain.	6.049573791844849
12830. those who had slickers	donned them.	19.187620789379995
12831. the others put on old coats or ducking jackets whichever	they carried behind their saddle cantles.	6.681001802490437
12832. there were seven	of them enough for a show of strength- to run a bluff.	11.867426970564397
12833. it was to	be nothing more than that.	18.516564242105492
12834. there was to be no gunplay.	34.604937542058515
12835. if the bluff	failed and they ran into trouble brannon had told the others they	would withdraw- and he would come after his son another time.	6.328852508894733
12836. he didn't	want to put himself outside the law.	11.45143587764551
12837. with him were hank	maguire luis hernandez and luis's son pedro.	7.741781272611518
12838. the ramirez	brothers were also along.	13.848082117783294
12839. the seventh man was red hogan a wiry little	puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising.	5.780140237098333
12840. they were	all good men.	16.961168054443622
12841. it was dark early because of the storm.	15.619305722096453
12842. also	because of the storm the streets of rockfork were deserted.	8.966209173803414
12843. lighted	windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour.	7.622507342753323
12844. they reined in	before the town marshal's office a box-sized building on main street.	8.619121390931282
12845. a lamp burned inside but brannon peering through the window	saw that the office was empty.	6.672298986820896
12846. he'd hoped to catch jesse macklin	there.	9.670406878971576
12847. probably just stepped out he said.	9.165925976869547
12848. red come along.	17.911547764126926
12849. the rest of you wait here.	17.09992591847822
12850. with	red hogan he rode to the welcome cafe.	8.581436094141479
12851. hogan got down from	the saddle and had a look inside.	6.210871206873012
12852. not there he said getting back	onto his horse.	10.768722126466878
12853. maybe he's at the hotel.	10.053899942483259
12854. they rode	to the rockfork house a little farther along the opposite side of	the street.	10.434201270820923
12855. they reined in there brannon remaining in the saddle while	hogan went to look for jesse macklin in the hotel dining room.	6.219400113295481
12856. he'd put on his old brown corduroy coat and	it was already soaked.	7.391013650626644
12857. but he felt no physical discomfort.	14.780741657599577
12858. he was	only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain.	13.82818170073849
12859. he hardly noticed the blue-green	flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder.	6.955990454870539
12860. hogan	reappeared stopped on the hotel porch lifted a hand in signal.	8.218065180188063
12861. brannon	dismounted and climbed the steps.	8.254441635698543
12862. he's finished eating	hogan said.	5.364141686031366
12863. sitting with a cup of coffee now.	9.355054121183528
12864. it seemed long at least to tom brannon.	15.178389017665019
12865. he	and hogan waited by the door one to either side.	6.210871206873012
12866. macklin was the	third man to come out and he came unhurriedly.	8.233625084439891
12867. he was puffing on a cigar	and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain.	7.107453254361385
12868. it was	not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them and	then it was too late.	8.609536043413298
12869. they closed in fast kept him from reaching inside	his coat for his gun.	6.793852307633501
12870. just come along brannon told	him.	14.00840206751307
12871. don't start anything you can't finish.	3.3326417997438393
12872. we'll talk over at your office.	5.970410411927927
12873. brannon i warn you! let's go marsh	al brannon said and took him by the arm.	5.993989951428768
12874. hogan gripped the	lawman's other arm.	10.472119682746735
12875. they escorted him down from the porch and through	the rain to his office.	7.561096338404582
12876. the other five slash-b men followed them	inside crowding the small room.	10.097168138754116
12877. his face was stiff with anger when	they let go of his arms.	7.5011629474845165
12878. he looked at each of them in turn brannon	last of all.	11.606923048946156
12879. i'll remember you he said.	4.98254549585643
12880. every	last one of you.	11.568363037656766
12881. as for you brannon-   put your gun on	the desk marshal.	9.142364692868934
12882. now hold on damn it; i won't-	red hogan's patience ran out.	8.859365232996492
12883. he lifted the skirt	of macklin's coat took his gun from its holster tossed it onto the	desk.	6.3332044950364645
12884. too much fooling around he said.	16.777816095848074
12885. don't press your	luck badge-toter.	3.241817001227866
12886. brannon said now the key to the lockup	marshal.	14.094126883018646
12887. what for?	20.454815948573874
12888. 	can't you guess?	13.148092146312546
12889.  brannon said.	12.292407525564322
12890. we're putting	you where you won't come to harm.	6.600764451543303
12891. get it	out!   damned if i will.	8.893662989748096
12892. brannon you've assaulted a	law officer and-   they moved in on him crowded him from	all sides.	6.886249538313906
12893. no man laid a hand on him but the threat of violence was	there.	7.21518003792628
12894. his face took on a sudden pallor became beaded with sweat and	he seemed to have trouble with his breathing.	8.047195734451709
12895. he held out a moment	longer then his nerve gave under the pressure.	7.233226891479716
12896. he swore and	said all right.	15.385132030882776
12897. it's here in my pocket.	2.8478925195944758
12898. get it out	brannon ordered.	14.028150955784652
12899. then as macklin obeyed: now let's	go out	back.	8.816686077540412
12900. resignedly macklin turned to the back door.	10.808564574657483
12901. they	followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty	feet to the rear.	5.835941997899846
12902. the door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded	with strap iron.	9.018047010095179
12903. it was secured by an oversized padlock.	14.641503533571957
12904. macklin	balked again not wanting to unlock and open the door.	9.069429662497702
12905. they crowded	him in that threatening way once more forced him to give in.	6.793852307633501
12906. once the	door was open they crowded him inside the dark building.	9.148455751515566
12907. he was uttering	threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked	the door.	7.3535919669018925
12908. they returned to the street mounted their horses	rode through the rain to the big house on houston street.	8.9974918171127
12909. its windows	glowed with lamplight.	10.502614833978878
12910. deputy marshal luke harper still stood	guard on the veranda a forlorn scarecrowish figure in the murky dark.	6.643215071337043
12911. he came to the edge of the veranda peered down at them with his hand	on his gun.	10.433731903740965
12912. don't try it brannon told him dismounting	and starting up the steps with his men following.	4.310328813746147
12913. don't get	yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you.	3.4187369901495104
12914. he strode past the now frightened man entered the house.	10.090191208524187
12915. miguel and	arturo ramirez remained on the veranda to keep harper from interfering.	6.192504140493174
12916. the others followed brannon inside.	15.352495886553934
12917. they trailed him across	the wide hallway to the parlor four roughly garbed and tough-looking	men who probably had never before ventured into such a house.	5.440267211116651
12918. they brought	to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves that of their	own sweat of campfire smoke of horses and cattle.	7.71411494317894
12919. they tracked	mud on the oaken floor on the carpet.	8.175689281675892
12920. their presence fouled the elegance	of that room.	10.382234806645563
12921. and their arrival caught john clayton and	charles ansley off guard.	7.980998954942467
12922. the author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing.	15.958506328311124
12923. for	men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had	received no second.	5.542917982132687
12924. but the day of the deadline came and passed and	the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction.	10.383396182710234
12925. for	with a single exception nothing had happened to them.	6.460370037324521
12926. the	exception was an iron mountain settler named william lewis.	8.196044167676531
12927. after	walking out to his corral that morning he'd been amazed to see the	dust puff up in front of his feet.	5.79419502081807
12928. a split second later the distant	crack of a rifle had sounded.	8.729997945191078
12929. he'd mounted up immediately and raced	with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the	shot had come.	5.083242045036259
12930. but he had found all of the thickets and points of	cover deserted.	16.263617458091403
12931. there had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or	trace to show that anyone had been near.	8.297238956507558
12932. lewis was a man who had	made a full-time job of cow stealing.	10.004782421123739
12933. he hadn't even pretended to	be farming his spread.	9.026368296067464
12934. his land had never been plowed.	12.608615397551533
12935. he had done	his rustling openly and boasted about it.	10.05140996736625
12936. he had received both first	and second anonymous notices and each time he had accused his neighbors	of writing them.	8.493302803846575
12937. he had cursed at them and threatened them.	10.918931351420587
12938. he was	a man those neighbors testified later who didn't have a friend	in the world.	8.630644840811472
12939. william lewis made the rounds of all who lived	near him again that august morning after a bullet landed at his feet	and once more he accused and threatened everyone.	4.861393316494661
12940. i'll	be ready next time! he raged.	9.670406878971576
12941. i'll be shootin' right back.	4.98254549585643
12942. he had his chance the very next morning for exactly the	same thing happened again.	10.353369544772141
12943. this time lewis had his own rifle in his	hands and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off	shot then spent most of the day searching out the area.	6.711582133352823
12944. he found nothing	but he still refused to give up and move out.	11.606570718568712
12945. just	let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face-to-face!	he exploded.	6.002446559592496
12946. that's all i ask!   he never got that	chance.	5.028623875776174
12947. for the unseen ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the	third time.	8.517214437888786
12948. 30-30 bullet smashed directly into the center of william	lewis' chest.	10.160966385020767
12949. he slumped against a log fence rail then tried	to lift himself.	7.560809233574742
12950. two more shots followed in quick succession dropping	him limp and huddled on the ground.	7.713412863882079
12951. an inquest was held and	after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes the county	coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of	300 yards.	6.380073495931705
12952. rumors of the offer tom horn had made at the stockgrowers'	association meeting had leaked out by then and as a grand jury	investigation of the murder got underway the prosecuting attorney	a colonel baird ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for	questioning.	6.057776250762027
12953. it took some time to locate horn.	13.369637315851138
12954. he was finally	found in the bates hole region of natrona county two counties	away.	10.107316701574787
12955. prosecutor baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there	after the shooting and began preparing an indictment.	5.326519577128725
12956. but that indictment	was never made.	21.387997073060106
12957. for tom horn it turned out had a number of	rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight	faces that he had been in bates hole the day of the killing.	7.711543222558707
12958. the former scout's alibi couldn't be shaken.	12.8377852653068
12959. the authorities had	to release him.	10.915477388587384
12960. he immediately rode on to cheyenne threw a ten-day	drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends.	7.6557099336907095
12961. dead center at three hundred yards that coroner said! he'd	grin.	6.368285828365234
12962. three shots in that fella 'fore he hit the ground! you	reckon there's two men in this state can shoot like that?	6.650356307813376
12963. 	publicly he denied everything.	9.118533821976325
12964. privately he created and magnified	an image of himself as a hired assassin.	8.329831901051985
12965. for a blood-chilling ring	of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for	the job he'd promised to do.	6.149311593160117
12966. tom horn was soon back at work	giving his secret employers their money's worth.	7.314792551946797
12967. a good many beef-hungry	settlers were accepting the death of william lewis as proof	that the warning notes were not idle threats.	6.7529917761768266
12968. the company herds were	being raided less often and cabins and soddies all over the range were	standing deserted.	9.28726063444865
12969. but there were other homesteaders who passed the	lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing the work of one of his	neighbors.	9.161313568795489
12970. the rustling problem was by no means solved.	12.349272568734234
12971. even	in the very area where the shooting had been done cattle were still	disappearing.	6.361988801188719
12972. for less than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of	the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his	existence might be foreclosed on- a blatant and defiant rustler named	fred powell.	6.831272097419633
12973. fred was mighty crude about the way he	took in cattle his own hired man andy ross mentioned later.	5.15576524365156
12974. everyone knew it but he sort of acted like he didn't care	who knew it- even after them notes came even after he'd heard about	lewis even after he'd been shot at a couple o' times hisself!	on the morning of september 10 1895 powell and ross	rose at dawn and began their day's work.	5.794407298988675
12975. haying time was close at	hand and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack.	5.442489997127004
12976. harnessing	a team to a buckboard they drove out to a willow-lined creek	about a half-mile off then climbed down and began chopping.	6.504428528168244
12977. andy	ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the	distant blast of a rifle sounded.	5.15576524365156
12978. he looked around in surprise then	noticed that fred powell was clutching his chest.	8.824820353737188
12979. the hired man	ran over to help his boss.	8.559202092877442
12980. my god i'm shot! powell	gasped.	11.992346169795113
12981. and he collapsed and died instantly.	12.811053267813671
12982. ross had no	intention of searching for the assassin.	9.288375818366491
12983. he heaved the dead man onto	the buckboard yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast.	6.276119584179756
12984. but he brought back the sheriff and several deputies and to the lawmen	the entire affair seemed a repetition of the lewis killing.	9.768737505296855
12985. a detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a	ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman's hiding place.	6.599382972382871
12986. there	were no tracks of either hoofs or boots.	8.949028830658037
12987. not even an empty cartridge	case could be found.	8.488232657465336
12988. once again tom horn was the first	and most likely suspect and he was brought in for questioning immediately.	8.72406656318464
12989. once again he shook his head kept his face expressionless and	his voice very calm and had a strongly supported alibi ready.	6.230103800637303
12990. later	riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies	of cheyenne he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations	he made.	6.775892589674704
12991. exterminatin' cow thieves is just a business	proposition with me he'd blandly announce.	6.126225880143168
12992. and i sort o'	got a corner on the market.	12.33461022388823
12993. tom a friend asked him	once how come you bushwhacked them rustlers?	6.112195546035221
12994.  they wouldn't	o' stood no chance with you in a plain straight-out shoot-down.	9.450293034129261
12995. he had lots of friends then as always.	10.918931351420587
12996. even as he became widely	known as a professional killer nearly every cowboy and rancher in	wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend.	7.449458498266163
12997. no man's name brought	more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo.	9.037148540440032
12998. well he	explained	s'posin' you was a nester swingin' the long rope?	9.25185671432612
12999. 	which would you be most scairt of- a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down?	6.107159981052837
13000. 	yeah i can see that the friend was forced to	agree.	11.212051246667523
13001. but h well it just don't seem sportin' somehow!	sportin'! the tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared	in amazement.	6.670433134891451
13002. sportin'! he echoed again in soft wonder.	9.060328853487057
13003. i	seen a lot o' things in my time.	6.764147616291221
13004. i found a trooper once the apache	had spread-eagled on an ant hill and another time we ran across	some teamsters they'd caught tied upside down on their own wagon wheels	over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o'	their skulls.	6.292464215253619
13005. i heard o' texas cattlemen wrappin' a cow thief up	in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink 'em and squeeze him to	death.	5.754028250023391
13006. but there's one thing i never seen or heard of one thing	i just don't think there is and that's a sportin' way o' killin'	a man!   after the first two murders the warning notes	were rarely ignored.	7.133714053883401
13007. the lesson had been learned.	10.915477388587384
13008. when fred powell's brother-in-law charlie keane moved	into the dead man's home the anonymous letter writer took no chances	on charlie taking up where fred had left off and wasted no time	on a first notice:   if you don't leave this country	within 3 days your life will be taken the same as powell's was.	5.510211089602737
13009. this was the message found tacked to the cabin door.	10.25010000299054
13010. keane	left within three days.	11.568363037656766
13011. all through albany and laramie counties	other men were doing the same.	7.3084495341002365
13012. houses of settlers who'd treated	the company herds as a natural resource free for the taking were	sitting empty with weeds growing high in their yards.	6.371420456284029
13013. the small half-heartedly	tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle	than farming were lying fallow.	6.195453398411556
13014. no cow thief could count on a jury	of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer.	7.571793478690667
13015. jury judge and executioner	were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure	that could materialize anywhere at any time to dispense an ancient	brand of justice the men of the new west had believed long outdated.	6.652297732757586
13016. for three straight years tom horn patrolled the southern wyoming	pastures and how many men he killed after lewis and powell	will never be known.	7.4772826017936955
13017. it is possible	although highly doubtful that he killed none at all but merely let	his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder	in the state.	7.052973009493851
13018. it is also possible but equally doubtful that he actually	shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him.	11.49858307116114
13019. for that legend was growing explosively rumor was insisting	he received a price of $600 a man.	7.330837936170385
13020. a monthly wage of about $125 very good money in an era when top	rumor had it he slipped two small	rocks under each victim's head as a sort of trademark.	6.967149461585221
13021. one thing was certain- his method was effective so	effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary.	6.737373972572852
13022. the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field	glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling	homesteaders out of the upper laramie country in a single week.	7.254679936126383
13023. my reputation's my stock in trade tom mentioned more	than once.	7.291914732090412
13024. he evidently couldn't foresee that it might be his downfall	in the end.	10.33992332664139
13025. he had made himself the personification of the	devil to the homesteaders.	10.822712590975025
13026. but to the cattlemen who had been facing	bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced	with lay-offs a few years earlier he was becoming a vastly different	type of legendary figure.	8.998225627747821
13027. such ranchers as coble and clay and the	bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while	he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown.	5.081273999431429
13028. he made their	spreads his headquarters and he helped out in their roundups.	10.5956113857914
13029. in the cow camps tom horn was regarded as a hero as the same	kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local	rodeos.	6.675350360850517
13030. the hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range	waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was	threatening a beloved way of life.	7.055040316164558
13031. the wailing guitar-strumming minstrels	of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him.	6.817408452020724
13032. by 1898	rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in	wyoming.	9.132183287343013
13033. when several minutes had passed and curt hadn't emerged from	the livery stable brenner reentered the hotel and faced summers across	the counter.	5.703434887995785
13034. i have a little job for you charlie.	16.783113355104557
13035. i'm	sure you won't mind doing me a small favor.	6.7647977463963205
13036. brenner's	voice was oily but summers wasn't fooled.	9.060328853487057
13037. he moistened his lips	uneasily.	14.0564280108931
13038. what is it you want me to do mr brenner?	13.668143370146634
13039. 	brenner shrugged carelessly.	10.363724110347151
13040. i just want you to take a message to diane molinari.	13.170083722140127
13041. tell her	to come here to the hotel.	8.062584570480723
13042. vastly relieved summers nodded	and started toward the door.	8.581436094141479
13043. one thing summers brenner	said.	19.263603413563676
13044. you're not to mention my name.	9.068556179045293
13045. tell her curt adams	wants to see her.	7.4073092375676035
13046. summers pulled up short and turned around.	9.060328853487057
13047. i don't know mr brenner he said haltingly	beginning to get an inkling of brenner's plans.	4.231433195197468
13048. it doesn't seem	quite right telling her a thing like that.	8.97118381342937
13049. couldn't i just-	his voice trailed off into silence.	6.764147616291221
13050. brenner continued to smile	but his eyes were cold.	9.042399241199941
13051. he turned and looked around at the lobby	as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed.	7.408229375658381
13052. you know	summers he said thoughtfully.	17.055565169455456
13053. eagle's nest ought to have	a fire company.	7.14162538120728
13054. if someone were to drop a match in here this place	would go up like a haystack.	8.777403073322198
13055. he started toward the stairway then	turned to add tell her to come to adams's room that adams	is in trouble.	6.710256295831818
13056. yes sir.	21.84573224153262
13057. his face	pale summers headed for the street.	9.705900421057073
13058. curt's visit to the	livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching.	7.3016633092037235
13059. he paused only long enough to ascertain that jess's buckskin	was still missing and that his own gray was all right then climbed	through a back window and dropped to the ground outside.	5.404277735189896
13060. the	fact that jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate	that diane's information had been wrong but curt didn't interpret	it this way.	6.940015446650669
13061. a man like jess would want to have a ready means	of escape in case it was needed.	7.469883705415442
13062. probably his horse would be close	to where he was hiding.	10.378711218693189
13063. from the back of the barn it was a simple	matter to reach black's house without using the street.	8.694118477870727
13064. curt	approached the place cautiously and watched it several minutes from the	protection of a grove of trees.	6.757567981697296
13065. there was a light in black's	front room but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior.	9.972150781566725
13066. curt circled the house and located a barn out back.	8.781071411144602
13067. he could hear	horses moving around inside and nothing else.	9.713194882521604
13068. there was no lock on the	door only an iron hook which he unfastened.	13.125676935851551
13069. he opened the door and	went in pulling it shut behind him.	7.560809233574742
13070. again he stood in the darkness	listening but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank	floor.	8.263985701809197
13071. he moved ahead carefully his left hand in front of him	and came to a wooden partition.	9.047809495604856
13072. horse smell was very strong and he could	hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws.	6.7522316282194215
13073. he found	a match in his pocket and lit it.	8.431773034471274
13074. there were two horses in	the barn a sway-backed dun and jess crouch's buckskin.	12.167815094052868
13075. curt snuffed	out the match.	9.118533821976325
13076. it was certain now that jess was in the house	but also presumably was stacey black.	11.759364146575555
13077. curt wanted to get jess	alone without interference from anyone even as spineless a person	as the store owner.	5.236383152695367
13078. he studied the problem for a few seconds	and thought of a means by which it might be solved.	9.796121875171602
13079. reaching across	the side of the stall he slapped the buckskin on the rump.	6.613992360534699
13080. the startled	animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall.	8.756844781870859
13081. as curt had hoped the house door banged open.	8.485260296365073
13082. he slapped	the buckskin again and it kicked wildly its hoofs rattling the side of	the stall.	8.906706013731672
13083. curt moved over beside the door and waited.	6.764147616291221
13084. presently	he heard footsteps crossing the yard and jess's smothered curses.	7.879513779734377
13085. the door swung open and jess said sourly what the hell's	the matter with you?	6.666308640079173
13086.    the horse continued to snort.	16.606517696108213
13087. curt doubted that any animal belonging to jess would find much reassurance	in its owner's voice.	5.427950274147271
13088. jess cursed again and entered	the barn.	9.670406878971576
13089. a match flared and he reached above his head to light a lantern	which hung from a wire loop.	5.829670714266847
13090. as he crossed to the side of the	stall curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer.	10.446925882968007
13091. before	you try anything he said.	8.254441635698543
13092. remember what happened to gruller.	16.609086007622327
13093. jess caught his breath in surprise.	7.622507342753323
13094. he started to reach	for his gun but apparently thought better of it.	9.730109959968066
13095. that's	the stuff curt said.	9.118533821976325
13096. just hold it that way.	14.00840206751307
13097. he reached out	to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt.	7.367789531495272
13098. you and	i have a little talking to do jess.	11.48832940527018
13099. you won't be needing this.	13.44371259307425
13100. he moved up and lifted jess's pistol out of its holster.	10.702694237569535
13101. damn you adams- jess was beginning to recover from his initial	shock.	6.837523265813775
13102. we ain't got nothing to talk about.	12.350455461918722
13103. if i don't	come back in the house breed's going to-   your trigger-happy	brother isn't in the house.	9.230904287574509
13104. about now he's probably	having supper.	13.006734615407726
13105. that long ride the four of you took must've given	him a good appetite.	6.829500528263492
13106. now turn around so i can see your face.	10.516444053962664
13107. there was raw fury in his eyes and the veins of his	neck were swollen.	10.681727081353161
13108. you're about as dumb as they come adams.	7.871837341937753
13109. i don't know what you're up to but when brenner-	you can forget about brenner too curt said.	4.343557290104509
13110. it's	ben arbuckle we're going to talk about.	8.982753431407628
13111. i don't know nothin' about him.	4.7491506386898426
13112. no?	19.804021762487697
13113.  i suppose you don't know anything about a piece of two-by-four	either; one with blood all over it arbuckle's blood.	6.848386696148314
13114. curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun.	9.817773142175593
13115. so help me crouch i'd like to kill you where you stand but	before i do i'm going to hear you admit killing him.	5.522749455638915
13116. who told you to do it?	12.48930063456222
13117.  was it dutch brenner?	15.900962242516597
13118. 	curt was holding jess's gun in his left hand.	8.196044167676531
13119. he drew back his	arm to slash the gunbarrel across jess's face but didn't finish	the motion.	6.512874137333827
13120. pistol-whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone	like jess but curt couldn't bring himself to do it.	6.54093796655646
13121. apparently	sensing this and realizing that it gave him an advantage jess	became bold.	5.825820622377272
13122. having all the guns makes you a big man don't	it adams?	8.268387317752088
13123.  if we was both armed you wouldn't talk so tough.	9.898384195492838
13124. no?	19.804021762487697
13125.  curt reached out and dropped jess's pistol	back into the holster.	6.210871206873012
13126. he retreated a step and holstered his own.	11.45143587764551
13127. all right crouch; we're on even terms.	8.961969194380144
13128. now draw!	sweat bubbled out on jess's swarthy face.	10.368578803405029
13129. the fingers of	his right hand twisted into a claw but he didn't reach for the gun.	6.33404546569971
13130. curt angry enough to be a little reckless raised his hands	shoulder high.	9.06700702824822
13131. does this make it any easier coward?	11.18160535091713
13132. 	i ain't drawin' against you jess said thickly.	8.581436094141479
13133. i	heard how you outdrew chico.	8.254441635698543
13134. you're the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind	and hits him with a club.	7.619211041248485
13135. i just wanted to hear you say so.	10.41765113989062
13136. jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his	sides.	7.198778874655976
13137. he had found curt's weakness or what to jess was a weakness	and was smart enough to take advantage of it.	7.968128149557376
13138. somewhere in	the distance a woman screamed.	12.780289393218238
13139. curt was too involved in his own problems	to pay much attention.	6.479874907873591
13140. he had to make jess talk and he had to	do it before stacey black got curious and came to investigate.	10.742929755418942
13141. once	more he lifted jess's gun from its holster only this time he tossed	it into the stall with the frightened buckskin.	5.459483995398501
13142. he dropped his own	beside it.	16.47926404760007
13143. we'll do it another way then he said harshly.	4.806945081755363
13144. jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which	was smashed out of shape by curt's fist.	6.757567981697296
13145. with a roar of pain	and fury jess made his attack.	8.716730326908243
13146. curt managed to duck beneath the	man's flailing fist and drove home a solid left to jess's mid-section.	6.643215071337043
13147. it was like hitting a sack of salt.	13.969165594653123
13148. pain shout up curt's	arm clear to the shoulder but jess seemed hardly aware that he had	been hit.	6.9448318610179385
13149. he slammed into the wall bounced back and caught curt with	a roundhouse right which sent him spinning.	6.174920939052518
13150. an inch lower and it	would have knocked him out.	9.268641810464125
13151. as it was his vision blurred and for a moment	he was unable to move.	11.540201641218632
13152. when his eyes began to focus he saw jess	charging at him with a pitchfork.	9.246096819239693
13153. curt twisted to one side	and the tines of the fork bit into the floor.	5.542917982132687
13154. jess wasted a few seconds	trying to yank them loose.	8.196044167676531
13155. it gave curt time to stagger to his feet.	9.740106390825309
13156. the tines broke off under jess's twisting and he swung	the handle in an attempt to knock curt's brains out.	7.493262886746913
13157. his aim was	hurried; so the pitchfork whistled over curt's head.	6.856825123186673
13158. by	now curt was seeing clearly again.	9.670406878971576
13159. he stepped inside jess's guard	and landed two blows to the big man's belly putting everything he	had behind them.	6.312228797442729
13160. they made jess double over.	14.714773213271867
13161. when his head came down	curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the	wall.	6.96502816887345
13162. the building shook setting the lantern to swaying and	the buckskin to pitching again.	8.346523409839932
13163. even black's old crowbait began	to snort and from the house black yelled jess! what's going	on out there?	7.2632680052790795
13164.    jess didn't seem too sure himself.	9.670406878971576
13165. he	lurched drunkenly to his feet lowered his head and took one step away	from the wall.	6.576782385019269
13166. curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which	started at the floor.	7.221918936957267
13167. blood gushed from	his nose and he backed off as rapidly as he could stumbling over his	own feet in his frantic haste to get away from curt's fists.	5.517345189490323
13168. curt was in almost as bad shape but he wouldn't quit.	7.615092762846159
13169. he backed	jess into a corner grabbed a handful of the man's shirtfront and	drew back his right fist.	6.730350773677291
13170. tell me about arbuckle! you	killed him didn't you?	8.873632373280508
13171.    it was brenner's idea	jess mumbled dabbing at his nose.	11.859831723497784
13172. he found out about you and arbuckle	talking.	13.391524163126732
13173. he wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who	tried to start trouble.	10.624304148705253
13174. you mean anyone who stood up	for his rights curt said.	10.781441329716351
13175. he let go of the shirt and jess slumped	to the floor.	7.560809233574742
13176. turning his back curt crossed to the stall reached	over to untie the buckskin's halter rope and waved his hand in the	animal's face.	7.016254153014417
13177. the buckskin bolted out of the stall.	10.953259697021208
13178. curt	moved in and picked up his gun.	9.060328853487057
13179. he shook loose straw out of the action	and placed the gun in his holster.	7.587625559514907
13180. leaving jess's where it lay	he left the stall.	9.357511128774851
13181. we're going someplace.	6.609156072070076
13182. jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the	door.	8.460824944593346
13183. who's in there?	10.363724110347151
13184.  black called fearfully.	13.649270166306609
13185. curt opened the door grabbed black by the shoulder and pulled him	into the barn.	5.542917982132687
13186. you're staying right here for a while.	7.555383342456829
13187. this dirty coward just admitted killing arbuckle.	9.240573005317144
13188. i'm going to let	him tell it to somebody else.	5.021813214007006
13189. he shoved black toward the stall	and pointed his pistol at jess.	7.560809233574742
13190. you're	coming along peacefully or i'll put a bullet in your leg.	7.615092762846159
13191. jess stumbled through the door.	8.254441635698543
13192. curt followed reaching behind him	to shut the door and hook it.	7.615092762846159
13193. black would have little trouble getting	out but it might delay him a few minutes.	5.953078246761409
13194. where're you	takin' me?	13.148092146312546
13195.  jess asked worriedly.	10.363724110347151
13196. we're going to	marshal woods's house.	7.3804064617970475
13197. maybe if the marshal hears this himself	it'll make a difference.	7.50941183093533
13198. somebody in this town must still have some	backbone.	9.230894788356071
13199. over his shoulder he could see max's loose grin and the burnsides'	glowering faces.	7.098992317334555
13200. soon as we	send them on their way and make camp let's you and me go for a walk	down by the snake- all by ourselves.	6.552916378234501
13201. sally admonished	her mother you've got all evening to visit with dan.	6.202987727583376
13202. his	wounds need dressing now.	11.568363037656766
13203. mrs jackson's words recalled	dan to his lack of fitness for courting.	7.033564643461397
13204. what a spectacle he was	caked with dirt and sweat and blood filthy as a pig and naked as an	indian kissing the finest the sweetest the bravest and absolutely	the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world.	6.471553141410679
13205. he released her reluctantly	for her enthusiastic reunion with old hap.	7.953394054598466
13206. got a lot	to tend to but i'll get back quick as i can he assured her.	7.446935570790257
13207. dan could hear clayton burnside and eben jackson summing up	their final reckoning for rental on the oxen.	5.307297689670258
13208. jackson was doing most	of the talking.	9.863004455864827
13209. so long as sally's pa was coming out best on the	haggle dan didn't feel the need of putting in his two-bits'	worth.	6.724446692575535
13210. soon as the burnsides moved on he'd lead rex down by the	river; there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening.	7.645119526556633
13211. damn	it he thought bitterly picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh	bullet hole in the sleeve.	5.807779761974589
13212. if i hadn't got nate stopped when	i did my duds'd all be shot plumb to hell!   he stooped	picked up his ruined hat and pursed his lips thoughtfully.	7.3450904547081555
13213. from the	way the wound in his head was itching dan knew that it would heal.	7.366495677796234
13214. but his only	hat was something else again.	14.522886520417298
13215. the burnsides now ready to roll were purposefully deaf to his	cry.	7.098087065137257
13216. nate! he bellowed to the retreating back directly	in front of him.	7.615092762846159
13217. i ain't going to fight you no more.	9.169644675936961
13218. nate turned his head attempting to speak in a soothing voice.	7.615092762846159
13219. i know you ain't! dan affirmed feeling ten feet tall.	9.27451821343373
13220. he moved in close jerked the handsome broad-brimmed beaver hat from	nate's head and clamped it on his own.	8.080705261612852
13221. here's a present for	you he said shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over nate's purpling	forehead.	4.651232142521892
13222. me and you's trading hats so's you'll have	something permanent to remember me by!   sally left her choring	to stand beside dan.	6.365727389270327
13223. slipping her hand in his they silently watched	the burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight.	5.579511986533377
13224. much as they had to look forward to they didn't begrudge a moment	of the time they spent seeing them go.	9.350495619808058
13225. at first matilda	could not believe her own eyes.	10.45669331840889
13226. she had spent too many hours looking	ahead hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of dan and finding	nothing but emptiness.	7.848201136937712
13227. and now she could see him looking uncommon	handsome standing there beside sally jackson and her folks in front	of their trail-worn wagon.	5.97202596005808
13228. seeing them waiting there at the	foot of emigrant rock was so overwhelming that for a good minute	after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward	them matilda could not speak at all.	5.974904992889133
13229. then with a glory that almost	wiped out the deep downward sags in her careworn face matilda leaned	over the wheel and shouted to hez who was stumbling along in the	heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon pa! pa!	i can see dan.	5.35379068632919
13230. and he's with the jacksons!   what	about burnsides?	11.852011282115413
13231.  hez asked who still believed they'd have them	to lick.	6.460370037324521
13232. they ain't even in sight! she replied.	11.967541482367666
13233. by then hez could see for himself and so could the others.	7.274102123453144
13234. soon they were all shouting greetings exchanging smiles and rejoicing	to think that they were all back together again.	8.280642643182565
13235. but even a reunion	as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day.	7.741220860602585
13236. nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until	they made circle tended the cattle tethered the horses gathered fuel	carried water and started their cooking fires.	6.574186305333164
13237. then and only then	with the jacksons and dan as their true guests of honor did the	harrows take time to catch up on the news.	5.823322159623792
13238. no sooner did they hear	of dan's injury than both gran and matilda went into immediate action.	7.662018386597633
13239. the wound in his scalp was examined pronounced healing and well	doctored with simples before they dished up the victuals.	5.670580783382225
13240. from then	on in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood	the whole group settled down to relish their food.	7.387542433692344
13241. even sally in	spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome followed the old taboo of quitting	the gab when wearing the nosebag.	5.6598458209561295
13242. after their supper	the evening turned into a regular hoe-down.	10.258702113353907
13243. only they	carefully	substituted old country folk dances for the virginia reels and	square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the	great westward migration.	5.246599493723186
13244. but with bill o'connor on the fiddle	and gran harrow exuberantly shouting glory be and hallelujah	above their united chant of the lilting old ballads they played	their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real	celebration.	6.9105984941294984
13245. golly rod exclaimed to harmony as he dutifully	stood by her side among the ringed spectators don't that	fiddle make you wish the bible didn't say us baptists can't dance?	4.656645272807095
13246. 	nor methodists neither she replied.	10.472119682746735
13247. not	that	it matters to me being this far along.	6.764147616291221
13248. rod gave her a warm	pat on the shoulder before he replied.	8.082271351627554
13249. come spring you'll be	kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too gal.	5.843289904990168
13250. at these words of sympathy and understanding harmony said generously	i don't mind setting here along with gran while you go out and	join in the games.	6.8769939431867035
13251. rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling	group out in the circle long enough to reply i ain't much	of a hand for dare-base and farmer-in-the-dell but i'd sure	like to get in on the handhold and wrestles.	4.950754548062888
13252. he looked down at his	big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers.	9.76585494295015
13253. don't reckon there's	nobody out there 'cept maybe dan who can outgrip me harmony.	3.4878160860915544
13254. with rod on his way and matilda visiting with mrs	jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff	harmony settled on the edge of the grub box to ease the pressure	of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs and worried about all that	might have happened to sally.	7.5043311814364495
13255. and she was deeply thankful that she	could see her now out there in the midst of a gay youthful circle	skipping and singing farmer in the dell farmer in the dell heigh-ho	the dairy-oh the farmer in the dell.	6.049982628084406
13256. at the sight	of sally's happy face and carefree expression harmony's dark brooding	eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears.	8.915689231319938
13257. she was glad completely	and unselfishly glad to see that things were working out the right	way for both sally and dan.	7.14658225520874
13258. h and she really tried to go a step	further and say she hoped they'd be just as right as they now were	for her and for rod.	7.521955577011828
13259. but she couldn't not yet.	15.145152070227198
13260. not with the memory	of her folks and the lost conestoga still holding her close h.	8.337868972741022
13261. out in the center of the circle the farmer who was dan wasted	no time when they came to the line the farmer choose his wife.	9.247891253560509
13262. with a swift swoop of his big arms he grabbed sally out of the	circle surrounding him and then kissed her soundly before setting her	down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest	of their outfit.	6.229588998868509
13263. soon the child the dog the cat h and even	the cheese all joined them out there in the circle.	6.226969139690791
13264. by now	harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and	resting or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure	of the great cliff towering above them.	7.697119038163193
13265. no matter how many registry	rocks they came to on this journey each one exerted its own appeal.	8.693155385738724
13266. even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization	when stumbled across out here in this wilderness.	8.192249229872033
13267. already	a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at	the register rocks leaving their own records along with those made by	the earlier trains.	4.726707772215755
13268. soon she saw rod and hez moving over to join them.	8.70482441652883
13269. no sooner were they through and the guards posted than the	whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep.	6.019818412716069
13270. for matilda it	was the first she had known in many a night.	8.95826603129812
13271. even the knowledge that	she was losing another boy as a mother always does when a marriage is	made did not prevent her from having the first carefree dreamless sleep	that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into bear	valley way way back there when they were crossing those other mountains.	4.810741948958806
13272. next morning they moved on again.	11.770322469990232
13273. my souls'	a-gracious! gran harrow exclaimed watching their rippling	muscles as rod and dan swung her up into the load.	5.449744428242049
13274. a body would	swear i floated right up here on a cloud!   rod and dan	released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged	embarrassed grins.	6.643707591850051
13275. shucks gran they said almost in unison.	7.14162538120728
13276. that	wasn't nothing at all!   leaning forward in her chair	gran nearsightedly scrutinized dan's face.	7.198778874655976
13277. how's sally	like rubbin' agin that thar little ticklebrush ye're a-raising?	6.210871206873012
13278. 	quit ragging him gran rod protested.	9.670406878971576
13279. i	ain't ragging him! gran peered again at the week-old blond	mustache shadowing dan's upper lip.	5.542917982132687
13280. but honest-to-betsy i've	seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon.	10.222147158536275
13281. the two	tall	brothers waited silently while their mother handed gran her cold	snack and water jug placed the chamber pot beside her feet and returned	to her place at the front of the wagon with alice.	5.909553395700729
13282. rheumatics	worse pa?	15.594944937291627
13283.  dan asked hez who had limped back from his	team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung	up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends.	4.928608045537711
13284. my right	leg's stiff as a board this morning he replied.	0.0
13285. but the sun'll	fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling.	8.783764297920749
13286. the three	men stepped out to the side to wait for captain clemens' signal.	9.92419478108032
13287. hez looked up at the high face of emigrant rock official signboard	for the raft river turnoff and gloated seems funny that	them burnsides never took time to leave their john-henry up thar.	4.849344473694158
13288. wonder what made them hurry so rod drawled giving	dan a sly wink.	7.391013650626644
13289. dan grinned and changed the subject.	7.840903646372331
13290. from	now on sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it	comes up and fall in behind you and rod's outfit.	7.104615268962541
13291. ain't	no sense you eating our dust rod protested.	6.764147616291221
13292. sally	and her ma want to trade off on account of harmony being so far along	dan explained.	7.062327511712909
13293. jackson recruited his critters and him and	me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up.	5.511087632670692
13294. he's	got the tightest running gear in the train now.	8.196044167676531
13295. besides 'tain't	no more'n right for me to follow with my black oxen so's i can	unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch.	5.071531497428397
13296. captain	clemens' signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting	teams.	7.879513779734377
13297. reckon ye're right dan hez called back over	his shoulder.	6.460370037324521
13298. i'll shore be needing ye both on the pull out o'	the canyon.	5.563953778783792
13299. rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing	precipice-walled gorge.	6.764147616291221
13300. we'll double teams zigzagging up the	mountain harmony he spoke reassuringly concerned by the pinched	look around her mouth.	5.514392650992082
13301. like enough we'll all be up on top by	sundown.	7.558293547990685
13302. out of the corner of his eye he could see his father's	wheels beginning to turn.	11.495535791324548
13303. before harmony had a chance	to reply rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen's backs h.	5.885168241210194
13304. while no larger than dutch springs this mining supply town had	the	appearance of being far busier and more prosperous.	7.318635808869248
13305. men crowded the streets	and freight rigs and teams were moving about.	6.792838430497672
13306. although they were	forced to maintain a sharper watch this activity enabled them to ride	in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid	them.	7.245799236089959
13307. gyp'll be holdin' forth in some bar if he's	here at all cobb declared glancing along the street as they stretched	their legs.	4.958070100322966
13308. there were no less than six or seven saloons	in ganado not counting the lower class dives all vying for the trade	of celebrating miners and teamsters.	9.0140833374213
13309. take one	side of the street and i'll take the other he proposed.	7.584793711293958
13310. if	you spot carmer give a yell before you move in.	9.722510781411229
13311. you do the same.	15.784668708114987
13312. it's all i ask stevens.	3.2927943356586518
13313. separating they took different sides of the main drag and	systematically combed the bars.	7.137257314233357
13314. russ visited two places without result	and his blood pressure was down to zero.	7.198778874655976
13315. suddenly it seemed to him	insane that they might hope to locate gyp carmer so casually even were	he to prove the thief.	6.092986498453369
13316. he tramped out of the miners rest with his	hopes plummeting and headed doggedly for the palace saloon the	last place of any consequence on this side of the street.	8.63371959832628
13317. the	palace was an elaborate establishment built practically on stilts in	front with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch.	5.358302766261679
13318. behind	its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest	to the rocky ribs of the canyonside.	6.643215071337043
13319. russ ran up the steps quickly to	the plank porch.	6.460370037324521
13320. the front windows of the place were long and narrow	reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of	the interior.	8.43056754362071
13321. heading for the batwings cobb glanced perfunctorily	through the nearest window and suddenly dodged aside.	5.542917982132687
13322. nerves tight as	a bowstring he paused to gather his wits.	8.192924849708817
13323. against all expectation	carmer was inside clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already	so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything	or anyone about him.	5.490644321171751
13324. fierce anger surged through russ.	10.472119682746735
13325. he fought	down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot.	6.512874137333827
13326. reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows he	feverishly scanned the busy street below.	0.0
13327. stevens was nowhere in sight.	8.254441635698543
13328. muffling an exclamation russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran	down.	7.615092762846159
13329. as luck had it he had not gone twenty feet in the street before	pat appeared.	8.738252114208894
13330. what luck cobb?	20.3435750720723
13331.  he said swiftly.	27.97057404811359
13332. he's there he got out tersely	curbing his rising excitement.	5.107476066452653
13333. hitching his cartridge belt around pat	glanced upward briefly at the palace and started that way with cobb	at his side.	5.665613888863096
13334. climbing the steps steadily they reached the	top and headed for the door.	8.369633190878782
13335. forced behind	him momentarily russ followed at once and halted two steps inside.	6.56946329790875
13336. while five minutes ago the place had presented a scene	of easy revelry with gyp carmer a prominent figure it was now	as somnolent and dull as the day before payday.	6.478877036068455
13337. carmer himself was nowhere	to be seen.	7.622507342753323
13338. a man knocked the roulette ball about idly	in its track and another dozed at one of the card tables.	8.794583937902644
13339. two men murmured	with their heads together at the end of the bar while the sleek-headed	bartender absently polished a glass.	0.0
13340. looking the setup over	stevens started coolly for the rear of the place.	8.062385606650531
13341. where yuh	goin'?	17.71347994630969
13342.    it was the barkeep.	39.834738767152594
13343. halting pat turned to	survey him deliberately.	7.622507342753323
13344. he did not reply going on toward the back.	16.356872806910072
13345. less	assured than the tall wide-shouldered man in the lead cobb followed	alertly a hand on his gun butt.	5.994012390172114
13346. the bartender measured this situation	with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it.	8.375413780721132
13347. a hall opened in back of the bar running toward an ell.	0.0
13348. small rooms probably for cards opened off on	either	side.	9.361534019739876
13349. all the doors were open at this hour except one and it was	toward this that stevens made his way with russ close at his shoulder.	5.968458477582549
13350. a single kick made it spring open	shuddering.	10.915928998043894
13351. pat saw gyp carmer staggering forward a half-filled bottle	upraised	as if to strike.	5.825820622377272
13352. russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside.	8.581436094141479
13353. with a bellow carmer lunged at him.	10.99370053964985
13354. but he was more than half-drunk	and his faculties were dulled.	17.331618183096317
13355. cobb unleashed a single powerful jab	that sent gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan.	5.377193086260091
13356. he started to struggle up heaving desperately.	13.51564199143308
13357. russ gave him a brutal	thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach.	5.937599263299073
13358. kneeling cobb	planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back holding him pinned.	8.409145925107978
13359. i've drawn his fangs he snapped.	4.7060581600896745
13360. go	through his pockets will you?	10.472119682746735
13361.  if we have to we'll take him apart	and see what he's made of!   complying methodically	pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing.	6.69257878962272
13362. cobb	watched this with hunted eyes his desperate hope waning by the moment.	7.391013650626644
13363. stevens was grunting over the last empty pocket when russ abruptly	rose and lunged toward carmer's hat which had tumbled half-a-dozen	feet away when he first fell.	5.033100711537648
13364. straightening up his	eyes ablaze he held out the battered stetson.	8.12713381548966
13365. look at	this!   inside the crown stuffed behind the stained sweatband	could be seen thin crumpled wads of currency.	6.256066682014651
13366. carmer's ingenious	cache for his loot had been found.	8.581436094141479
13367. by golly stevens!	you were right russ exclaimed tearing the loose bills out	of carmer's hat.	6.187757732873326
13368. that is if we can be sure this is colcord's	money-   pat grunted.	12.260762564479416
13369. where else would he get it?	9.490694971130479
13370.  count	what you've got there cobb.	10.472119682746735
13371. russ	ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any	cowpuncher would come by honestly.	5.236383152695367
13372. it's within a	hundred of what crip had he declared.	3.923236818204181
13373. we know penny spent some-	and carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on.	7.590322808920819
13374. handing the money over russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs	as if ridding himself of something unclean.	6.643215071337043
13375. his glance at gyp	carmer was disdainful.	8.755009490035256
13376. shall we get out of here?	12.929874569942651
13377.    leaving	the card room they moved back through the palace the way they	had come.	5.976499918681157
13378. glowering looks met them in the bar but there was no attempt	to halt them.	10.108796579061487
13379. pausing in the outside door to glance behind him pat	looked his unspoken warning and stepped out.	5.326519577128725
13380. he and cobb clattered	down the high steps to the street.	11.575118156690358
13381. neither spoke till they reached	their horses.	9.295954988307729
13382. pat paused there looking across at the young fellow.	8.196044167676531
13383. it'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to colcord	and tell him about it russ.	5.774424701438377
13384. he started to return it.	17.073623377602907
13385. to	his faint surprise russ held up his hand.	6.764147616291221
13386. not me he ruled decidedly.	14.174471042466617
13387. it was you that tracked it down anyway stevens	he pursued strictly.	10.161861790706435
13388. whatever you say.	15.691887355838423
13389. pat swung into the saddle yet still he delayed	his brows puckered.	6.002446559592496
13390. you owe it to penny to give her a chance	to explain that she was defending you really he observed mildly.	8.542724086848624
13391. old crip wasn't retorted cobb tartly.	8.660957748045897
13392. he'll	know when you tell him.	10.472119682746735
13393. but i want this to sink in awhile.	11.548595190853225
13394. then maybe	next time he won't be so quick on the trigger.	8.887534383548
13395. pat	had never pretended to give advice in such affairs.	6.460370037324521
13396. you're the	doctor he returned with a smile.	7.555383342456829
13397. but i still think penny's	an awful nice girl russ-   you don't have to tell	me flashed cobb.	6.8595314974281525
13398. giving the other a dark look he hauled his bronc	around and trotted down off the street.	6.858079133914293
13399. pat let him go following	more leisurely.	7.987912096448633
13400. at the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in	for his dinner and as a consequence did not see cobb strike the open	range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells	for antler.	8.066401883886721
13401. the truth was the puncher was both bewildered	and dismayed by his own mixed luck.	8.080589940715665
13402. penny's always glad to see me	over there he mused bleakly.	8.495747701004069
13403. yet had he not visited the girl at	saw buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle.	7.285048215065631
13404. over and above that however was his growing suspicion of chuck	stober's part in recent events.	8.290344616382832
13405. gyp carmer couldn't have	known about colcord's money unless he was told- and who else would	have told him?	5.236383152695367
13406.  he asked himself.	28.33806944970897
13407. it's the second time war	ax hands made a play for that money.	2.9226689217784902
13408. how much of an accident	could that be?	15.353313727728768
13409.    nearing home he jerked to attention at	the distant crack of a gun.	5.825820622377272
13410. in town no one paid much attention to an	occasional shot; but on the range gunfire had a meaning.	10.406522765282297
13411. hauling up	russ listened carefully.	9.118533821976325
13412. two minutes later it came again- a double	explosion followed by a third sounding more distant.	8.1928517542221
13413. as near	as cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the	antler ranch house.	8.750616076247766
13414. he tightened up in a twinkling.	16.336756715865913
13415. so far as he knew	only his father could be there.	11.182216018538162
13416. what did it mean?	18.039490430079823
13417.  clapping spurs	to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter with growing alarm.	6.155077427685913
13418. his first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells	told	him nothing.	8.94921340855341
13419. still a quarter-mile away the fresh clap of guns only served	to increase his speed.	6.48022804370751
13420. setting a course straight for the house	he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his	face.	6.622743565597765
13421. when it was followed by a second whining even closer	cobb	swerved sharply aside into a depression.	9.886869090588077
13422. he knew now what he was	up against.	15.499957972613625
13423. whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging	the antler house and having spotted his approach was determined	to drive him off before he could get into the fight.	5.722775862532498
13424. cursing	himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in	his saddle boot russ drew his colt and examined it briefly.	6.715362175508109
13425. if he	wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested	he had his answer a moment later.	6.917946057457864
13426. over this way! he ain't	gone far! a harsh cry floated to him across the brush.	7.985774453166502
13427. a carbine cracked more loudly and a slug clipped fragments from the	brush off at one side.	5.901300571347011
13428. the would-be assassin had his position figured	pretty close.	9.615649650156676
13429. dismounting russ looked about hastily.	8.254441635698543
13430. toward the	west this depression led toward a draw.	8.872067005404576
13431. leading his pony he hurried	that way not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding	range.	6.747703015790408
13432. swinging up then and bending forward over the	horn he urged his mount down the meandering draw.	6.757567981697296
13433. he had not covered	a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind.	8.417263418429698
13434. he had	been sighted and his attacker pumping shot after shot.	10.090191208524187
13435. a shot or two	went wild before cobb felt something tug at his foot.	6.40132428842376
13436. a slug had torn	half of his stirrup-guard away.	10.179668886367091
13437. a second twitched his shirtsleeve	and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm.	7.028314027430636
13438. jumping jerusalem! let's get out of here!	at the first shot russ had hurled his mount to the left toward	the side of the winding draw.	7.9704460914813975
13439. the long minute before he reached effective	cover seemed endless.	9.251651769897041
13440. sweeping a look around he saw that he	was safe for the moment.	7.84311999053569
13441. he heard cries from behind him but he could	make out no words.	7.233226891479716
13442. he dashed madly for the next elbow turn in	the draw and made it.	9.763970123356119
13443. recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an	intersecting draw he plunged forward with undiminished speed.	5.542917982132687
13444. gradually	the wash climbed upward forcing him toward open range.	8.196044167676531
13445. yet he must	chance it.	13.368991509557514
13446. he clambered out of the dwindling wash the loose dirt	flying behind him and flashed a look about.	8.694901941582073
13447. early in november the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned	missions.	8.727226133731616
13448. and sweeney squadron put its first marks on the combat	record.	10.433925209344057
13449. every plane that could fly was sent into the air.	7.191528098751059
13450. cricket took eight ships and went south across the straits and along	the north coast of mindanao to cagayan.	6.54093796655646
13451. anything the enemy flew	or floated was his target.	6.764147616291221
13452. fleischman with eight was to patrol the leyte	gulf area with his main task to get any kamikaze before they	got to the ships.	6.221143152558621
13453. greg himself took two flights with todman leading	the second to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around	ormoc on the east coast of leyte.	5.69835021650121
13454. each plane carried two five-hundred	pound bombs.	11.470707663229751
13455. a weapons carrier took greg todman belton	banjo ferguson and walters and the others the two miles from the	bivouac area to the strip.	5.904533723970889
13456. it was a rough long ride through the mud	and pot holes.	14.466590328868872
13457. no one had much to say.	12.877086197266262
13458. the sky glowered down at them.	12.435529358277208
13459. there was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the	others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever.	7.113765238955437
13460. the truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread	through the jungle.	8.649006242526841
13461. donovan snatched greg's chute from him with	a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it.	5.72567496288069
13462. his face was	dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his	pilot.	9.234233378981362
13463. greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been	in one before.	7.91495906830234
13464. but his hands and those of donovan moved automatically	adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure.	10.588633527238716
13465. i've	got her as neat as i can donovan said as he dropped the straps	of the seton harness over greg's shoulders.	5.559234826036489
13466. it's for carabao not airplanes.	3.6130210406737766
13467. don't you worry chief greg replied wondering if he himself	believed it.	3.45771207061658
13468. see you donovan said as he jumped	off the wing.	9.98938587285404
13469. the expression was his trade-mark his open sesame to	good luck and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return.	5.697787971430103
13470. at the prearranged time greg started the engine and taxied out.	12.719616034165087
13471. from	the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight	he knew donovan would keep his back to the strip.	6.4229442026456995
13472. he wondered where	the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief	to watch his plane take off on a combat mission.	0.0
13473. yet long before the	scheduled time for return donovan would be watching for every speck	in the sky.	5.928469440575993
13474. greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip and	one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him.	6.688738619334004
13475. the dark	brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful.	7.098087065137257
13476. the	pilots' heads looked ridiculously small.	10.472119682746735
13477. the control tower gave him	immediate take-off permission and the clean roar of the engine that	took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of donovan.	6.059906226322791
13478. greg's mission was the last to leave and as he circled the ships	off tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again.	7.4232513389761605
13479. to the west	the dark green hills of leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway	up their slopes.	7.761859796507501
13480. underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray.	8.141833774228488
13481. water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and	out of showers.	6.284118870221087
13482. the metal strip they had taken off from was coal black	against the green jungle around it.	7.663024046550707
13483. he possessed the fighter pilot's	horror of bad weather and instrument flying and he wondered if	the ceiling did drop whether he and the other flights would be able to	find their way back in this unfamiliar territory.	5.229239784383155
13484. he shivered in the	warm cockpit.	15.385132030882776
13485. the overcast was solid above him.	9.802060557618772
13486. as far as he	could see there was no hole to climb through it.	13.853895050755424
13487. they would have to	go west through the narrow river valley that separated leyte from samar	and hope that it didn't close in before they returned.	5.772081433367898
13488. greg	pushed the radio button on his throttle.	9.060328853487057
13489. todman let's try	to go under this stuff.	7.14162538120728
13490. stay in close and we'll go up the valley.	8.196044167676531
13491. roger sweeney todman called back and pulled his four	in and slightly above greg.	5.674295354649883
13492. greg took the formation wide	around three a-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the gulf.	6.964918561258953
13493. he dropped down to five hundred feet swinging a little north of	the city of tacloban and punched into the opening that showed against	the mountain.	5.501226153701229
13494. the valley was only a few hundred yards wide	with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree	turn.	9.997476287123401
13495. it was only a fifteen-minute flight but before it was	through greg felt	himself developing a case of claustrophobia.	9.055532570691994
13496. the ceiling	stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet and at times	the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in.	7.373514164345098
13497. if the other pilots were worried	they did not show it.	9.503041934363603
13498. when the sea was visible ahead of them the relief was as great as if	the sun had come out.	9.129894012481689
13499. he spread the flight out and led them across a	point of land and then down the coast.	7.001679406962039
13500. although they drew light ground	fire they saw no signs of activity.	9.471119023684144
13501. once todman thought he	had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while greg covered him.	6.46628584163565
13502. somebody beat us to it! todman said over the radio as he	came back up in formation.	6.9055300153233325
13503. visibility continued to be limited	and greg was never able to get above a thousand feet.	6.357791812986914
13504. his earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts	made by other flights.	8.536873447354653
13505. he thought once that he identified the somewhat	hysterical voice of fleischman claiming a kill.	6.718491433348979
13506. but greg's	area remained as placid as a florida dawn.	11.077418040299065
13507. finally as time	began to run out he headed into ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses	that intelligence had thought might contain japanese supplies.	5.731865951489221
13508. the low clouds made bombing difficult.	12.435529358277208
13509. there was not enough room to	make the usual vertical bomb run.	11.781159490633787
13510. one	of greg's bombs hung up and he was miles from the target before he	could get rid of it.	9.79548324829545
13511. only one of the flight scored a direct hit and	the rest blew up jungle.	9.913674754864177
13512. with their load of bombs gone the planes	moved swiftly and easily.	10.114544467135744
13513. greg went up tight against the ceiling	and led them back to their pass to home.	5.866615902245837
13514. mercifully it was still open.	12.307418001460265
13515. like a man making a deep dive greg took full breath and plunged	back into the valley.	6.130498149744266
13516. he was about to make a gas check on his flight	when todman's voice broke in: sweeneys! three bogies.	10.754351267290007
13517. greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument	panel.	7.14162538120728
13518. he saw them specks against the gray but closing fast.	10.68920301578696
13519. they were headed straight for each other on a collision course.	8.86681792034207
13520. friend	or enemy?	15.594944937291627
13521.  the same old question.	15.623960480474757
13522. and only a few seconds to answer	it.	14.108271081723629
13523. zeros! todman said excitedly and hopefully.	7.622507342753323
13524. and then he thought todman might be right.	14.425417225201892
13525. his mind flicked	through the mental pictures he had from the hours of aircraft identification.	5.986320865341358
13526. he narrowed the shape down to two: either a zero or a u	s navy type aircraft.	8.03471371830941
13527. if it were the enemy tactically	his position was correct.	13.49358469096989
13528. japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability	american on speed and firepower.	8.006748814719227
13529. his present maximum altitude	up against the overcast gave him the opportunity to exploit his	advantages.	7.5326321834121215
13530. but it also made him conspicuous to the enemy if it was	the enemy and he hadn't been spotted already.	10.136182047176286
13531. but the closing aircraft	showed no sign of deviating from their original course.	8.324822006799968
13532. in	seconds greg made his decision.	10.472119682746735
13533. he pushed the radio button.	12.127026643485452
13534. sweeney blue hit the deck.	10.472119682746735
13535. todman you take	the one on the left.	7.14162538120728
13536. belton the one on the	right.	10.472119682746735
13537. if h if they're japs.	13.591508785087713
13538. greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two	rogers.	7.372299321263268
13539. the planes light with most of the gas burned	out responded beautifully.	8.200962349854278
13540. greg's airspeed indicator was over 350	when he leveled off just above the trees.	7.198778874655976
13541. the opposing aircraft continued	to come on.	9.802060557618772
13542. they appeared to be the enemy.	20.354214149294577
13543. greg wished the air	corps had continued to camouflage planes.	6.460370037324521
13544. there was of course no	way for the other planes to get by them.	13.497865217211324
13545. but they could	turn and escape to the east.	11.08703888480591
13546. greg pushed the radio button again.	9.670406878971576
13547. todman drop your second element back.	7.622507342753323
13548. if any of us miss they	can pick up the pieces.	14.898772682870684
13549. now let's make sure they're japs.	9.565087858411951
13550. even as he said it greg knew they had found the enemy.	10.77496298545525
13551. the	shapes were unmistakable and the rising suns were showing up slightly	brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom.	5.326519577128725
13552. greg slapped his hand	across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight.	6.643215071337043
13553. the circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector	glass in front of him.	8.310291036991702
13554. arm your guns sweeneys.	11.94288351290035
13555. they're japs came a high-pitched	voice.	4.34364927851166
13556. one pass only.	21.099229660929627
13557. you'll bust your ass in this canyon.	3.9707751807522804
13558. he moved the flights over against one wall.	11.964341073946793
13559. it gave them	all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away	that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery.	6.430654525730001
13560. if the turn was too tight a barrel roll would bring them out.	10.218168306520626
13561. a hell of an altitude for a barrel roll but it could be done.	7.8282435128105305
13562. greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the rpm	and the engine responded as if it had been waiting.	8.167429421261573
13563. the clearly	identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around.	7.0206417700592505
13564. they	haven't seen us greg yelled to himself over the engine noise.	7.615092762846159
13565. he hit the radio button.	13.241961750164016
13566. let's take 'em home.	9.399195184809551
13567. he hauled back on the	stick and felt his cheeks sag.	7.953394054598466
13568. out of the corner of his eye he watched	his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him.	9.605135593634683
13569. with the rapid rate of closure the approach from below	the side and ahead there would be only a moment when damage could	be done.	7.312477183573427
13570. just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer	from a diving board.	8.3975409116217
13571. his nose up.	12.631558650863068
13572. it	was going to be dangerous.	14.546874103765118
13573. eight aircraft in this small box.	11.344057971754431
13574. please	dear god make my pilots good he prayed.	8.581436094141479
13575. he took a lead on	the enemy using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight	and then added another.	7.021774343900954
13576. the enemy did not veer.	15.541283477894908
13577. it did not seem possible	that they hadn't been spotted.	11.774147319112792
13578. now!	greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger.	9.060328853487057
13579. the plane rumbled	and slowed.	15.006368630910437
13580. six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished.	10.474428524536204
13581. as if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them.	9.737977655988256
13582. greg tightened his	turn until the plane shuddered.	9.060328853487057
13583. his burst held	for a second on the engine section of the plane.	8.309871369174228
13584. the jap's propeller	flew off in pieces.	12.435529358277208
13585. a large piece of engine cowling vanished.	9.808417290594114
13586. it	was all greg had time to see.	11.920966050249687
13587. his maneuvering for the shot had placed	him near the overcast almost inverted and heading up into the clouds.	5.490830404558971
13588. his speed was dropping rapidly.	12.214555706636531
13589. if he spun out now he would join	his opponent on the ground.	8.665525835840842
13590. wingman stay clear he prayed.	10.472119682746735
13591. he	pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back.	6.002446559592496
13592. he fought	the panic of vertigo.	15.385132030882776
13593. he had no idea which was up and which was	down.	10.956166640332203
13594. he held the controls where they had been.	13.528650257941315
13595. sweat popped out over	him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip.	5.326519577128725
13596. his	air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out.	8.494656881897287
13597. over the rattling of fenders humming of tires and chattering	of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles.	6.39380951819323
13598. cool	air moving slowly through the open or smashed-out side windows hinted	of blooming roadside vegetation and occasionally a faint fragrance	of perfume swirled from the back seat.	6.046219493410928
13599. moriarty my driver	suddenly exclaimed with something so definite so final in his tone	i	once more repeated the absurdity mustering all my latent powers of	hypocrisy to sound convinced.	4.726707772215755
13600. we were coming to an intersection	turning right chuffing to a stop.	10.394674302063548
13601. forced to realize that	this was the end of a very short line i scanned a road marker and discovered	what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old	mexican: moriarty new mexico.	6.419748593746067
13602. adios i	said exhausting my spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one	of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host's daughters.	6.290129093830134
13603. i	waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading	through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass.	5.175885573103299
13604. then	i saw the father's head slightly turn; gauche rainbow shapes replaced	the poignant ovals of gold.	6.886249538313906
13605. white-shirted	and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward	the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze.	5.427950274147271
13606. suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled and thumbing hopefully	i saw emergent in windshield flash: red lips streaming silk	of blonde hair and- ah trembling confusion of hope apprehension	despair- the leering face of old herry.	6.0689894043071515
13607. mor-ee-air-teeeee	he shrieked his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of	the glittering blonde.	6.002446559592496
13608. over the rapidly-diminishing outline of	a jump seat piled high with luggage herry's black brushcut was just	discernible near or enviably near that spot where- hidden- more	delicately-textured most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming	back in cool oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca	flowers and engine fumes.	5.958192813285801
13609. i would have foregone	my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty	and- well at least i wouldn't have shouted back a taunt.	7.43020106995404
13610. still nursing anger i listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly	approaching its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me.	7.30773626570091
13611. just as i straightened up with my duffel bag i heard: sahjunt	yoorick meet mrs major j a roebuck.	6.419956662484502
13612. the	voice	was that of johnson tail gunner off another crew.	8.196044167676531
13613. squeezing	a look between johnson's fat jowls and the car frame a handsome	and still darkhaired lady inquired y'all drahve?	5.338658481068594
13614.    i	nodded.	19.804021762487697
13615. onleh one thiihng mrs roebuck continued.	7.622507342753323
13616. ahm goin nawth t'jawn mah husbun in sante fe an y'all maht	prefuh the suhthuhn rewt.	6.886249538313906
13617. but corporal johnson has alreadeh said it	didn make no diffrunce t'hi-im.	7.793238909001978
13618. i said that it didn't	make any difference to me either as far as i knew.	11.459209849013192
13619. how far	i knew will shortly become apparent.	9.014756067409975
13620. let me pass over the trip to sante	fe with something of the same speed which made mrs roebuck	wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit is still	in ee-faket.	8.222195793526675
13621. i let up on the accelerator only to gradually	reach again the 60 mph which would i hoped overhaul herry	and the blonde and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had	something more important to catch than had i mrs major roebuck	settled down to practicing on corporal johnson the kittenish wiles	she would need when making her duty call on colonel and mrs somebody	in sante fe.	4.649444372121782
13622. when johnson ejaculated howsabout my	buying us all a nice cold co-cola ma'am?	9.199012967671463
13623.  mrs roebuck smilingly	declined and began suddenly to go on about her son who was onleh	a little younguh than you bawhs.	6.088841318970467
13624. johnson never would	have believed she had a son that age.	8.330408334145353
13625. mrs roebuck thought johnson	was a sweet bawh t'lah lahk thet but her herman was getting	to be a man there was no getting around it.	5.566376978538451
13626. just befoh he left	foh his academeh we wuh hevin dack-rihs on the vuhranduh major roebuck	an ah an huhmun says 'may ah hev one too'?	6.697790291677587
13627.  just as	p'lite an- an cohnfidunt an ah says 'uh coahse you cain't'	but he says 'whah nawt you ah hevin one'?	5.596079695220521
13628.  an ah coudn ansuh	him an so ah said 'aw right ah gay-ess an his fathuh didn uttuh	one wohd an aftuh huhmun was gone the majuh laughed an tole me	thet he an the bawh had been hevin an occasional drink t'gethuh f'ovuh	a yeah onleh an occasional one but just the same it was behahn	mah back an ah doan think thet's nahce at all d'you?	5.382246229449221
13629. 	no i don't johnson said.	8.254441635698543
13630. i'm a good baptist	and drinking h	mrs roebuck very kindly let me drive	through sante fe to a road which would she said lead us to taos	and then raton and eventshahleh out of new mexico.	4.8622598886816295
13631. how lightly	her eventshah-leh passed into the crannies where i was storing	dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus and how the word	would echo.	5.411534792860049
13632. hardly had mrs roebuck driven	off when a rusty pick-up truck father or grandfather of senor	moriarty's ford sedan came screeching to a dust-swirling stop	and a brown face appeared its nose threatened by shards of what	had once been the side window.	5.850340377509339
13633. the straight black hair flopped in a vigorous nod the slender nose	plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back.	5.670580783382225
13634. johnson unwired	the right hand door whose window was like the left one merely loosely-taped	fragments of glass and johnson wadded himself into a narrow	seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer.	5.888417324946763
13635. in	back buddy the driver said to me.	7.14162538120728
13636. quickly but carefully	lowering my duffel bag over the low side-rack i stepped on the running	board; it flopped down sprang back up and gouged my shin.	6.447358989032307
13637. the truck	was hurtling forward.	12.486750257698887
13638. i seized the rack and made a western-style	flying-mount just in time one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel	bag- and merely wrecking my camera i was to discover later-	my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and- but this	is no medical report.	6.250991236240689
13639. i was again in motion and at a speed	which belied the truck's similarity to senor x's ford turtle.	7.1724619547317054
13640. maybe i would beat old herry to siberia after all.	8.944542120903378
13641. whatever satisfaction	that might offer.	10.644760651758617
13642. i	drew back drawing back my foot for a kick.	8.196044167676531
13643. but it was only johnson	reaching around the wire chicken fencing which half covered the truck	cab's glassless rear window.	8.721820142277132
13644. the way his red rubber lips were stretched	across his pearly little teeth i though he was only having a	little joke but no he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind	so he could roar something into my ear.	7.09455047283008
13645. wanna beer?	12.292407525564322
13646. 	hell yes i roared back between dusty lips.	8.581436094141479
13647. did i	want a beer?	11.38188706046207
13648.  did an anteater want ants?	12.753372627778857
13649.    bueno amigo.	12.292407525564322
13650. gracias i hollered my first long swallow filling me with confidence	and immediately doubling the size of my spanish vocabulary.	7.535854441406693
13651. at once my ears were drowned by a flow of what i took to be spanish	but- the driver's white teeth flashing at me the road wildly	veering beyond his glistening hair beyond his gesticulating bottle-	it could have	been the purest oxford english i was half hearing; i	wouldn't have known the difference.	4.937539494474681
13652. johnson was trying to	grab the wheel though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from	it.	6.643215071337043
13653. white teeth suddenly vanishing the driver slammed the side of	his bottle against johnson's ear.	6.267028259993275
13654. we were off the road gleaming	barbed wire pulling taut.	13.989876635574372
13655. i ducked just as the first strand broke	somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards.	7.743229088748747
13656. we	were in a field in a tight screeching turn.	9.559786607121845
13657. prairie dogs were popping	up and popping down.	7.14162538120728
13658. when i fell on my back i saw a vulture hovering.	11.665761730874744
13659. just as i got to my knees there was again the sound	of the fence stretching and i had time only to start taking my kneeling	posture seriously.	5.72248295557298
13660. this time no wire came whipping into the truck.	12.171601008695644
13661. we were back on the road.	14.947418178701996
13662. i regained my squatting position	behind the truck cab's rear window.	10.227318669010717
13663. johnson's left hand was pressed	against the side of his head red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers.	6.565717587272904
13664. tee-wah the driver cackled his black eyes glittering	behind dull silver chicken fencing.	7.391013650626644
13665. that was tee-wah i was	talking.	14.489280984403985
13666. you thought i was a mexican didn't you buddy?	13.061016110258542
13667. 	i nodded.	12.292407525564322
13668. hell that's all right buddy the indian	said.	9.060328853487057
13669. miraculously	the bottle was still in my hand foam still geysering over my	waterproof watch.	6.60054055782131
13670. no sooner had i started drinking than the driver	started zigzagging the truck.	8.904244347554268
13671. i drank	furiously.	22.589978126100267
13672. emptied the bottle.	13.148092146312546
13673. teeth again flashing	back at me the driver released a deluge of spanish in which amigo	appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of	surrounding sound.	4.985901720220426
13674. i bobbed my head each time it appeared.	11.633205579815934
13675. suddenly	the spanish became an english in which only one word emerged	with clarity and precision son of a bitch sometimes hyphenated	by vicious jabs of a beer bottle into johnson's quivering ribs.	4.879191495777179
13676. a big car was approaching its chrome teeth grinning.	11.805409464962437
13677. beyond	it the gray road stretched a long long way.	6.685106412743281
13678. the car was just about to	us its driver's fat solemn face intent on the road ahead on business	on a family in sante fe- on anything but an old pick-up truck	in which two human beings desperately needed rescue.	6.839008775614739
13679. high so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off	the car's steel roof.	8.41458069310289
13680. on unoccupied roadway the bottle	shattered into a small amber flash.	11.293394391330427
13681. aye-yah-ah-ah!	the indian was again raising his bottle but to my astonished relief-	probably only a fraction of johnson's- the bottle this time	went to the indian's lips.	4.913025681226917
13682. another car was coming a tiny	dark shape on a far hill.	8.19431892800833
13683. i started looking on the splintery truck	bed for a piece of board a dirt clod- anything i could throw and	with better aim than i had thrown the beer bottle.	5.859456438357015
13684. in the ditch sand was white and soft-looking only an occasional	pebble discernible faintly gleaming.	9.963405818544096
13685. but johnson couldn't quickly	unwire the truck door and if i escaped he might suffer.	7.319117169144651
13686. the car was approaching fast.	16.50044323498891
13687. on the truck bed there was nothing smaller	than a piece of rusty machinery; with more time i could have	loosened a small burr or cotter pin-   suddenly and not a second	too soon i thought of the coins in my pocket.	5.896414780272337
13688. there was no time to	pick out a penny; i got a coin between my thumb and forefinger leaned	my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck	cab and flipped my little missile.	8.850736795605911
13689. there was a blur just under	my focus of vision a crash; the car's far windshield panel turned	into a silver web with a dark hole in the center.	7.03610521405441
13690. i heard	the screech of brakes behind me an insane burst of laughter beneath me.	8.613473101510026
13691. looking back i saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car	and trying to read our license number.	6.060256399627308
13692. johnson's	fat hand another bottle were protruding from the truck cab	and that self-proclaimed baptist teetotaler had a bottle at his own	lips.	6.365727389270327
13693. two cars came over a crest their chrome and glass flashing.	6.706899174032806
13694. the indian's arm whipped sidewise- there was a flash of amber	and froth the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of	the first car.	7.287959225745178
13695. i saw johnson's	bottle snatched from his hand saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind	the second car.	6.349652470242145
13696. this time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking	of women.	11.181114312544745
13697. i looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated	oval of the car's rear window.	7.265368279457589
13698. drink you son of a bitch!	i quickly turned around and began to drink.	8.927543654795038
13699. but the indian was	jabbing another bottle toward johnson.	10.886882630824374
13700. i guided her to the divan turned off the tv faced her.	10.48304906924822
13701. she sat quietly staring at me from the wide eyes.	7.533469760296565
13702. and what eyes they	were.	21.79500841751721
13703. big and dark a melting golden brown.	7.14162538120728
13704. eyes like hot honey	eyes that sizzled.	9.670406878971576
13705. plus flawless skin smooth brow and cheeks lips that	looked as if you could get a shock from them.	5.339677735093881
13706. it was a disturbingly	familiar face too but i couldn't remember where we had met.	12.00405110959422
13707. i said do we know each other miss?	9.169644675936961
13708.    no i	remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here and	when it happened all i could think of was- this time she stopped	the rush of words herself.	6.7803887687907105
13709. shall i go on?	9.526326063943847
13710. 	she smiled.	15.594944937291627
13711. it was her first smile.	19.850098703869534
13712. but one word at a time ok?	19.913958279400354
13713.  she	was	still hugging the stained coat around her so i said relax let	me take your things.	5.427950274147271
13714. would you like a drink or coffee?	18.23801518472665
13715. 	no thanks.	12.292407525564322
13716. she stood up pulled the coat from her shoulders and	started to slide it off then let out a high-pitched scream and i	let out a low-pitched wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out.	6.354161124886297
13717. she	was wearing nothing beneath the coat.	7.738906147426005
13718. she jerked the coat back on and	squeezed it around her again but not soon enough.	7.938920619783123
13719. there had been a	good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out and	now i was certain i'd seen her somewhere before.	6.519228320525749
13720. oh do forgive me.	13.980946987867025
13721. i'm sorry!	i forgive-   that's what started all the trouble in	the first place.	3.9129367137318405
13722. oh dear i'm all unstrung.	12.392495127773664
13723. you and	me both dear.	15.784668708114987
13724. haven't we h haven't i seen you h.	8.581436094141479
13725. i mean	surely we've-   you may have seen me on tv	she said.	9.154036761753622
13726. i've done several filmed commercials for-	then it hit me.	5.655827641105407
13727. and	you recognized me?	10.363724110347151
13728.    yes indeed.	21.84573224153262
13729. in fact i was watching	you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell.	7.551904831394007
13730. man you rang- it was in color too miss and h miss?	10.716079473605097
13731.  what's	your name anyway?	10.363724110347151
13732.  ah you were splendid.	11.568363037656766
13733. i sat by her on	the divan.	10.981588546931944
13734. in a waterfall h and all that.	15.37633746891233
13735. that's	the last one we did.	8.254441635698543
13736. that was a fun one.	22.124746249033073
13737. it was fun for me all right.	16.035008331442473
13738. i don't mean to pry but do	they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles?	5.716349130142658
13739.  i mean: is advertising	honest?	14.392431089066493
13740.    it depends on who does it.	17.27402323907656
13741. i never wear anything	at all.	14.038815781487214
13742. it wouldn't- wouldn't seem fair somehow.	16.49084636425047
13743. i couldn't agree with you more.	10.981588546931944
13744. i really do have something	important to tell you mr scott.	12.243247440528103
13745. murder?	15.610129252044759
13746.  oh yeah i said.	13.980946987867025
13747. tell me about the murder.	8.63130203283259
13748. zing was the creation of two men louis	thor and bill blake partners in zing! inc.	7.9482363028274765
13749. they'd	peddled the soap virtually alone and without much success until	about a year ago when- with the addition of sx-21 to their	secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising	campaign- sales had soared practically into orbit.	5.414143481502669
13750. their product had	been endorsed by good housekeeping the ama and the	veterinary journal among other repositories of higher wisdom	and before much longer if you didn't have a cake of their soap in	the john even your best friends would think you didn't bathe.	5.651497548272583
13751. my lovely caller- joyce holland was her name- had previously	done three filmed commercials for zing and this evening the fourth	a super production had been filmed at the home of louis thor.	5.14556003046911
13752. the water in thor's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket	of thick foamy soapsuds- fashioned of course from zing-	joyce had dived from the board into the pool then swirled and cavorted	in her luxurious bath while cameras rolled.	6.332144824801509
13753. the finished-	and drastically cut- product would begin with a hazy longshot of	joyce entering the suds then bursting above the pool's surface clad	in layers of lavender lather and i had a hunch this item was going	to sell tons and tons of soap; even to clean men and boys.	4.854878191004766
13754. joyce went on when we'd finished lou- mr thor- asked	me to stay a little longer.	6.886249538313906
13755. he wanted a few stills for magazine ads	he said.	10.045661864242307
13756. everybody left and i stayed in the pool then lou came	back alone and leaped into the pool too.	7.641381537326485
13757. and he didn't have any clothes	on.	8.077190605697862
13758. he didn't!   yes he didn't.	15.385132030882776
13759. did leap into the pool and didn't	have anything on.	7.404782773794389
13760. anyway it was evident what he had in mind.	10.260705938499873
13761. you got away didn't you?	13.44371259307425
13762.    yes.	19.804021762487697
13763. he	caught up with me once and grabbed me but i was all covered with zing-	it's very slippery you know.	5.971365382847026
13764. i wouldn't have the stuff in the house.	11.633205579815934
13765. but i'm pleased to	hear-   so i just scooted out of his clutches.	8.10748938320502
13766. i swam	like mad got out of the pool grabbed my robe and ran to the car.	9.724262073741098
13767. the	keys were still in it and i was miles away before i remembered	that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana	where i'd changed.	5.325170481977567
13768. she'd driven around for a while	joyce said then thinking louis thor would have calmed down by that	time she'd gone back to his home on bryn mawr drive parked	in front and walked toward the pool.	5.940255209625414
13769. while several yards from it still	concealed by the shrubbery she'd seen two men on her left at the	pool's edge.	5.7949352188056515
13770. she went on:   a man was holding onto lou	holding him up.	9.624716282324696
13771. maybe lou was only unconscious but right then i	thought he must be dead.	6.621721047404789
13772. the man shoved him into the water then ran	past the cabana.	11.69759223638121
13773. there's a walk there that goes out to quebec drive.	3.707015557625905
13774. i was so scared h well i just ran to my car and came here.	9.182661750888853
13775. you know who the other man was?	12.580412011022721
13776.    no i never	did see his face.	12.819249588425034
13777. i didn't get a good look at him at all his back	was to me and i was so scared h it was just somebody in a man's	suit.	5.397636474549057
13778. but i'm sure the other one was lou.	11.89315510008271
13779. what joyce	wanted me to do was go to thor's house and do whatever detectives	do and get her clothes- and handbag containing her identification.	5.845600895435814
13780. she realized i'd have to notify the police but fervently	hoped i could avoid mentioning her name.	7.735353964671092
13781. her impact in the	zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent	part in an upcoming tv series underwater western eye a	documentary-type show to be sponsored by oatnut grits.	5.005694622213313
13782. but if joyce	got involved in murder or salacious scandal the role would probably	go to the sponsor's wife mrs oatnut grits.	8.35828069198485
13783. or at least not	to joyce.	12.320931447709786
13784. and i so want the part she said.	13.362094569937229
13785. the	commercials have just been for money there hasn't been any real incentive	for me to do them but in underwater western eye i'd	have a chance to act.	5.242625557400603
13786. i could show what i can do.	14.837566747431469
13787. as far as i was concerned she had already and had dandily shown what	she could do.	9.995195665888438
13788. but i promised joyce i would mention her name if	at all only as a last resort.	10.717312064629864
13789. seeming much relieved she smiled one	of those worth-waiting-for smiles and i smiled all the way into the	bedroom.	6.230495312194571
13790. there i got my colt special and shoulder harness slipped	my coat on and went back into the front room.	9.64558295594004
13791. joyce squirmed	a little on the divan.	9.372655463421253
13792. i'm starting to itch she said.	5.1153798896086915
13793. itch?	15.610129252044759
13794.    yes i'm still all covered with that	soap.	11.774124892626075
13795. i was loaded with suds when i ran away and i haven't had a	chance to wash it off.	6.6105172514603066
13796. you might	as well wait here while i'm gone so you can use my shower if you'd	like.	10.331341096987442
13797. i showed her the shower	and tub and she said smiling if you really don't mind i think	i'll get clean in the shower then soak for a few minutes in your	tub.	5.801416469151765
13798. doesn't it you?	13.148092146312546
13799.    only	when i do it.	9.118533821976325
13800. one of my virtues or vices is	a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and	glorious living color.	9.977324460892477
13801. soak h as long as you want joyce.	9.890068620298873
13802. it'll	probably be at least an hour or two before i can check back with	you.	8.083541986280155
13803. so you'll have everything all to yourself doggone h	i looked at my watch.	6.232777304942418
13804. time to go i supposed.	15.77150607446382
13805. you'd better hurry.	8.50172930762657
13806. oh you can count on that.	14.224044229481462
13807. warmly.	15.610129252044759
13808. i'll be soaking	for h at least half an hour.	5.778634477885085
13809. that was all she said.	16.90216703088527
13810. but suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms	of bees in them.	10.147152192279691
13811. however when there's a job to be done i'm	a monstrosity of grim determination i like to think.	7.576449280422178
13812. i spun about	and clattered through the front room to the door.	11.055482970001897
13813. as i went out i	could hear water pouring in the shower.	9.134564553812666
13814. she wouldn't be	taking a cold shower.	12.671390746668923
13815. bryn mawr drive	is only two or three miles from the spartan and it took me less than	five minutes to get there.	6.934185892003663
13816. but the scene was not the quiet calm scene	i'd expected.	13.500474913863766
13817. four cars were parked at the curb and two of them	were police radio cars.	6.455954026125326
13818. lights blazed in the big house and surrounding	grounds.	9.319463867624348
13819. i followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the	house to the pool.	7.938415010526363
13820. two uniformed officers a couple of plain-clothesmen	i knew and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the	pool on my left.	7.190851859254803
13821. at the pool's far end was the little cabana joyce	had mentioned and on the water's surface floated scattered lavender	patches of limp-looking lather.	6.751570994737055
13822. a few yards beyond the group of men	a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra.	9.258961565310356
13823. lieutenant rawlins one of the plain-clothesmen spotted	me and said hi shell and walked toward me.	6.209756704519463
13824. how'd you	hear about this one?	10.472119682746735
13825.  i grinned but ignored the question.	10.981588546931944
13826. he didn't	push it; rawlins worked out of central homicide and we'd	been friends for years.	8.52351370118872
13827. a call to the police	had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine pm	and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that-	10 minutes ago now.	5.657749756076065
13828. present at the scene- in addition to the dead	man who was indeed louis thor- had been thor's partner bill	blake and antony rose an advertising agency executive who handled	the zing account.	7.07611301669543
13829. neither of them i understood had been present	at the filming session earlier.	7.048110171423141
13830. what were they doing here?	14.705292966559352
13831. 	i asked rawlins.	10.363724110347151
13832. they were supposed to meet thor	at nine pm for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their	soap a new angle based on this sx-21 stuff.	7.242286335891138
13833. yeah	i've heard more about sx-21 than space exploration lately.	6.460370037324521
13834. what is the gunk?	28.806663980962636
13835.    how would i know?	12.560755744970368
13836.  it's a secret.	2.0733821419749328
13837. that was the new advertising angle- something about a lloyd's	of london policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient.	7.534831749610795
13838. actually	only two men know what the formula is blake and- he	stopped and looked at thor's body.	0.0
13839. i said ok	so now only blake knows.	9.95288923829895
13840. how's it strike you foul or fair?	9.060328853487057
13841. 	can't say yet.	10.363724110347151
13842. deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked	in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on 'em.	6.708763462606182
13843. the pm	might show he drowned instead but that's what the once-over-lightly	gives us.	6.751501880992878
13844. accident murder suicide- take your pick.	9.670406878971576
13845. anything else?	12.292407525564322
13846.    according to rose	he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted thor in	the water got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started	hauling him out.	6.88915680099805
13847. too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education	is to help you make a living; this is not so for education offers	all kinds of dividends including how to pull the wool over a husband's	eyes while you are having an affair with his wife.	6.1879031999100045
13848. if it were	not for an old professor who made me read the classics i would have	been stymied on what to do and now i understand why they are classics;	those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick.	7.203148967635346
13849. i worked for my uncle	who ran one of those antique	shops in new orleans' vieux carre the old french quarter.	6.537665820494522
13850. the	arrangement i had with him was to work four hours a day.	9.9070532306351
13851. the rest	of the time i devoted to painting or to those other activities a young	and healthy man just out of college finds interesting.	5.680289064962329
13852. i had	a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with	flowers and plants blooming everlastingly in the southern sun.	7.766408194887925
13853. i had	come to new orleans two years earlier after graduating college partly	because i loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted	art colony there.	5.789169178680539
13854. when my uncle offered me a part-time job which	would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint i accepted.	7.769106061036509
13855. the arrangement turned out to be excellent.	14.17482649690671
13856. i loved the	city and i particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of mardi gras.	8.613473101510026
13857. i had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide	joyous celebration with romance in the air; and when you took a walk	you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting	around the next corner.	5.777766476217049
13858. the very faces of the people bore this expectation	of fun and pleasure.	11.702103876020626
13859. it was as if they could hardly wait to get	into their costumes cover their faces with masks and go adventuring.	8.471024942082256
13860. my uncle and i were not too close socially because	of the difference in our ages.	7.852296292047304
13861. sometimes i wondered vaguely what he	did about women for my aunt by blood had died some years ago but neither	of us said anything.	6.001277060741321
13862. one monday morning i saw him approach the	store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new aunt.	8.759393648650104
13863. they were	married over the week-end though he was easily sixty and she could	not have been even thirty.	6.058143405225215
13864. she looked more like twenty-five or six.	11.583842136067785
13865. it was really a may and december combination.	13.062289472438172
13866. my new aunt	was perhaps three or four years older than i and it had been a long	time since i had seen as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex.	7.942300342554079
13867. there was	something about the contour of her face her smile that was like new	orleans sunshine the way she held her head the way she walked- there	was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me.	5.430171969684121
13868. her legs	were the full sexy kind full bodied like a rare wine and just as	tantalizing to the appetite; the calf was magnificent the ankle perfect.	6.35831630554089
13869. you must forgive me if i seem to dwell too much on her	physical aspects but i am an artist accustomed to studying the physical	body.	7.214983628332955
13870. the true artist is like one of those scientists who from	a single bone can reconstruct an animal's entire body.	8.393654918883493
13871. the artist looks	at an ankle a calf a bosom and in his mind's eye the clothes	drop away and he sees her as she really is.	5.954464292117986
13872. and that is the way i	first saw her when my uncle brought her into his antique store.	12.528514064275933
13873. that she impressed me instantly was obvious; i was aware that when	our eyes met we both quickly averted them.	6.064827762236738
13874. i thought i saw a faint	surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks.	8.787921353669596
13875. true	she was my aunt married to an uncle related to me only by marriage	but why she had married a man twice her age and more perhaps i	did not know or much care.	4.586903320700317
13876. she was standing with her back to	the glass door.	11.748835214675307
13877. her form was silhouetted and with the strong light i	could see the outlines of her body a body that an artist or anyone	else would have admired.	5.533139776674146
13878. as it is in so many affairs of the heart a	man and a woman meet and something clicks.	15.97799927331495
13879. something clicked in this	instance but i treated her circumspectly and i felt that she knew	it for we both kept our distance.	5.379846115286013
13880. when she appeared at the store	to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious	lest my uncle notice it.	9.61723699992136
13881. and then i became aware that she too	glanced at me surreptitiously.	8.583103773873264
13882. i felt that her eyes were undressing me	as if she were a painter and i a nude model.	8.515598107275313
13883. i dismissed these feelings	as wishful thinking but i could not get it out of my head that	we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared	to dwell on it because of our relationship.	5.6248328337307445
13884. when our eyes met the air	was filled with an unuttered message of me too.	9.230637446612144
13885. you have probably	experienced this.	20.973604522745962
13886. it is nothing you can put your fingers on but	the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity.	11.871439735817162
13887. why	she married him i do not know.	8.56980322529376
13888. i myself was fond of him but what a	young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me.	7.520788769518607
13889. he already	had that slow pace that comes over the elderly while she herself had	all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living.	5.643519459602098
13890. perhaps with	my uncle she found a measure of economic security that she needed;	or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father; some women with	father fixations do.	7.237505723759769
13891. for several weeks we eyed one another	almost like sparring partners and then one day uncle was slightly indisposed	and stayed home; his bride opened the store.	5.643507055907795
13892. i was waiting	in front of it when she showed up and told me of my uncle's indisposition.	9.932864953432079
13893. even as she was telling me about it i became aware of a give-away	flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks and	subconsciously i realized that when she entered the store she did	not switch on the lights.	5.355150291347882
13894. the cavernous depth cluttered with antiques	echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the	rear and took the seat at his desk.	6.956770037933358
13895. she placed her palms fingers	outspread on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say now what next?	6.2239942778710535
13896. 	i was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me	the time was opportune.	7.047384533528901
13897. there was little likelihood of any customers	walking in at that hour.	11.122798164010788
13898. i was standing beside her watching the outspread	palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall	on which he sometimes napped.	7.677255501664245
13899. i bent and kissed the still pink	neck and suddenly she jumped up and her two arms encircled me in	a bear-like crush.	5.737723150024694
13900. her mouth which had been so much in my thoughts	was warm and moist and tender.	9.119527030884969
13901. i heard her murmur we'd better	lock the door.	9.444967469039936
13902. it did not take me long to slip the bolt securely	and return to the rear and its couch.	11.816750887236568
13903. when we opened the	door again for business and switched on the lights she said:	he will not always be indisposed.	6.745559880085014
13904. i was thinking	about that.	22.914651541700916
13905. how will we work it out?	9.848508342076084
13906.    i don't	know she said.	13.56922352282361
13907. you figure it out.	15.784668708114987
13908. i've	noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met.	8.294759413379953
13909. i guess we both felt it.	10.981588546931944
13910. i guess so	she said.	18.25917094604721
13911. but now what?	22.38458084266495
13912.    even as i said it i	realized that an education can be invaluable.	8.85440117684749
13913. i know what	we can do i said.	11.89674929739515
13914. tell him i made a pass at you.	8.873632373280508
13915. she	raised a protesting hand with a startled air.	6.764147616291221
13916. what are	you trying to do?	14.705292966559352
13917.  get thrown out?	12.918306430440287
13918.  if i even hint at it do you think	it will matter that you are his nephew- and not even a blood nephew?	8.826680784762209
13919. 	i don't want to be thrown out and i don't think	i will.	6.521855570810012
13920. i think i have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting	us.	16.969296708904302
13921. by telling him you are making passes at me?	7.523759031676731
13922. 	she said incredulously.	13.148092146312546
13923. when i was in college i	grinned i remember a poem i had to read in my lit class.	8.014804361903854
13924. i don't	even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century	poets.	12.69900678250633
13925. in those days poems often told a story in verse and those	boys had some corkers to tell; and now i think we can use the knowledge	they passed on to us.	7.044192835864756
13926. tomorrow mardi gras opens officially.	10.472119682746735
13927. a lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks and having	a ball.	7.918646130639459
13928. there will be romance and flirtation.	29.538239385823953
13929. if you tell him i	made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something i said	or did so instead of just telling him i made a pass say i tried to	date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse	i really am.	5.105883935571165
13930. we made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street	near lake ponchartrain.	8.796572548607026
13931. and to prove what you tell him about	me you suggest that he keep the date instead.	7.02292204478826
13932. you are both the same size.	17.799652589239614
13933. he could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask.	7.532033043620742
13934. when i show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him	about it.	9.785315799335066
13935. don't	worry about me.	8.97651057505685
13936. it will turn out all right.	21.560095113659646
13937. i don't understand	she insisted.	6.084341628539399
13938. are you trying to cut your throat?	16.372549214728426
13939. 	no i chuckled i'm just beginning to collect dividends	on my investment in education.	5.995898935233661
13940. as we expected on	the following day my uncle was completely recovered and opened the store	as usual at 10 in the morning.	8.408322816569253
13941. i felt that he looked at me coldly	and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards	me should be but he did not say one word which might indicate that	he had been told of advances to his wife.	6.028904568711531
13942. i quit work at my usual	hour as if this day was no different from other days.	8.446345981748577
13943. i heard subsequently	that my uncle and aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in	the french quarter after which he went home to get into his costume	to keep the date.	5.75693058438817
13944. shortly before nine i drove my jalopy to the street	facing the lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from	the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view.	6.633014778469783
13945. a few minutes later i saw my uncle's car drive up and a woman's	figure emerge and walk to the corner.	7.241860355015119
13946. i must say the figure was	well made up.	13.844658007210091
13947. if it were not that i knew who it was i could have mistaken	it for my aunt so well did her clothes fit him.	6.787987122416531
13948. in one hand he	gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain.	10.596765915327987
13949. i suspected why he brought it along.	9.95288923829895
13950. in the half darkness i	approached cautiously making sure he did not see me.	12.53648711313128
13951. he was looking	out on the dark waters of the lake when i came upon him and without	wasting words i smacked him hard across the face.	6.63237659139716
13952. you cheap	bitch! i exclaimed.	20.025453829488345
13953. you cheap no good two-timing bitch!	you get a good loyal husband- smack!- and you fall for a pass	by his own nephew! you should- smack!- be ashamed of yourself.	5.341346727547167
13954. he had better write a postcard to walter.	14.604182388729264
13955. he opened the myth book again	and there	were the names of four munich bars and meredith wilder's address.	6.730350773677291
13956. the bars were marked as walter had marked them in a small black	book kept in a nearly secret drawer.	8.286369987102445
13957. the code which had probably	something to do with sex or some other interest nicolas was determined	to find out and put to use.	6.112511376416085
13958. a card to walter would get him an introduction	to this meredith and that might be good for something.	7.721252831576493
13959. nicolas	called on his muse a line came back:   squaresville	man and all the palazzos are crummy palasts.	5.8530748053844555
13960. that	ought	to draw a laugh nicolas reasoned as he stored the line away on the	wax tape that was his mind.	6.620719246690807
13961. and indeed his postcard did draw	from walter a letter recommending his friend the poet nicolas manas	to his friend meredith wilder.	5.674986732408373
13962. five days later on receiving it	meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table.	7.967137862312493
13963. his hand was large and square and heavily tanned.	7.18676379039501
13964. the voice crying in him was the voice of guilt.	12.214832694694532
13965. his four weeks	in italy had turned into nearer three months.	6.856825123186673
13966. he had returned to the	pension a week ago.	14.969447737063966
13967. now he was just in the late poems of ho^lderlin	and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him- plus	next semester's class preparation.	8.804311525618557
13968. he was determined to spend an	industrious summer.	15.307648396335768
13969. well maybe manas wouldn't call.	10.59633742259972
13970. meredith's	fingers slowed and stopped over a line before him: sie la^cheln	die schwarzen hexen.	7.412171373124522
13971. the menace of manas gradually faded	as meredith asked himself should he translate it 'how the dark	fates laughed'?	5.902564164932943
13972.  or more rhythmically 'the swarthy witches are	laughing'?	10.700038467957514
13973.  and he missed the point that the swarthy witches might	be laughing at him for hoping to escape nicolas manas.	6.877499200528492
13974. but	nicolas too was being interrupted that morning.	9.060328853487057
13975. not by the	11:00 sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the	english gardens and sent him off to sleep; but by a blond girl in	a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded	him.	5.19149010943987
13976. should she wake him?	15.455292294365764
13977.  she didn't have the heart.	7.074315004291785
13978. her heart	her maternal feeling in fact her h her being was too busy expressing	itself as quietly thrilled by this sight of her nicolas curled asleep	under a blanket in a park like a scene from poussin.	5.891316808475071
13979. she was just	not able to break the spell.	9.824933488533212
13980. known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer nicolas had	found his first night in one of walter's marked bars?	7.811405086334562
13981.  nicolas:	look nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys- no sex see?	6.312214519594106
13982.  so	if all these beers was to get me in bed man you just spent a lot	of money.	6.9570556834897666
13983. ballet dancer: protests tears and take what you	want nicolas i am a dancer you are a poet it is all beautiful.	6.263810713359908
13984. to this meek conjugation nicolas had replied ok i can	use this blanket.	9.65751827383385
13985. and when you get off this job tonight well you	can gimme something to eat.	7.436077916051048
13986. and as a matter of fact nicolas had	slept in the park only part of one night when he discovered that munich's	early mornings even in summer are laden with dew.	9.63262887012617
13987. he had always	known how to find a bed and on his own terms.	9.787855119666025
13988. he used the blanket	for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs	and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few	her nicolas lay	curled in the sun like a fawn black hair falling over his eyes.	6.277012334751412
13989. she	was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of	a long meaningful search for truth.	6.7613538395688435
13990. this was surely a reunion in art	it was all that poetry promised.	10.172121948152373
13991. that long night with nicolas	and marijuana in venice had opened her eyes.	7.09355477563453
13992. his advice his voice	saying his poems the fact that he had not so much as touched her-	on the contrary he had put his head back and she had stroked his	hair- this was all new.	8.662235051911875
13993. her eyes had opened she had caught a glimpse	of a new faith.	6.382269394684917
13994. the next day he was gone.	21.94050315086618
13995. mary jane	might not be the most intelligent woman but she was one of the most	determined.	9.195683454801314
13996. even so it took her several days to force walter to tell	her nicolas's whereabouts.	10.151122225224427
13997. packing a small suitcase informing	her husband whom she found in harry's bar that she was taking a train	to germany to get away for a while patting his arm refusing a	drink getting on the train- all this had only taken her two hours.	4.930649596261287
13998. she had arrived this morning and come straight to the english gardens.	10.477060902062103
13999. dear girl walter had finally said he writes me that he	is sleeping in the english gardens.	5.382107390363457
14000. how like him! mary	jane had smilingly said.	11.436703851707046
14001. his address walter added is that	great foundling home the american express.	6.583156031491742
14002. and i will greatly	appreciate it if you will not tell your husband h.	12.87638842591007
14003. for the last	half hour mary jane had criss-crossed half the length of the gardens	and at last come upon her knight.	7.641108283492373
14004. his presence there asleep in	the grass confirmed all that mary jane believed it was in his power	to teach her: freedom from the tedium of needs such as hotels the meaning	of nature how to live simply with the angels.	6.592275995691751
14005. she set	down her suitcase.	12.783489925651207
14006. should she wake him?	15.455292294365764
14007.  no.	15.610129252044759
14008. smiling she sat down	on the suitcase and waited and watched.	7.879513779734377
14009. the sun grew hotter	as it approached the midday.	9.389872917460421
14010. nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed	against the dashboard of a speeding car.	7.5237959691111325
14011. in	his dream he cried slow down for chrissake! he half woke	and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass.	5.584374158454297
14012. he blew his nose expertly between his fingers.	11.45143587764551
14013. he half sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then	more vigorously between his legs.	6.034462242787552
14014. mary jane got up quietly and walked away.	9.37376021208253
14015. twenty minutes	later she was at the desk of the gra^fin's pension her tears	dried signing a hotel form and asking for a bath.	6.8605717552519545
14016. mary jane	belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions	in all the major and minor cities.	7.640116704687601
14017. she had retreated to this world.	12.135548376058335
14018. the gra^fin who was charmed by her told her your sister who	was here two years ago has quite dark hair.	8.116733510668347
14019. nevertheless there is no bath.	13.027505737121041
14020. but a young american	has a bath next to his room and i shall ask him if you might use it	this once.	8.972710568928255
14021. and then we shall see h.	15.514976132816052
14022. meredith was irritated when the gra^fin	knocked at his door and told him she is a great beauty!	shall we allow her not to have a bath?	7.91749369136559
14023.  actually she is a sad beauty	i believe.	10.30246579515978
14024. you shall see her at dinner.	15.000064054538505
14025. rather erotically	he listened to the bath water running; when it stopped he began busily	typing sitting up in a virtuous way.	6.277361323215509
14026. before dinner he shaved for	the second time that day.	9.898027540698465
14027. a thing he did not like doing generally.	9.301018358651694
14028. singing into the mirror and his interested eyes he was pleased to note	when he stripped for his own bath that he still had the best part	of his italian sun tan.	6.281582644532504
14029. he flexed his muscles for several minutes	got into the tub and then grew self-conscious of splashing as he washed.	5.909009505545415
14030. in the small gallery used as the guests' dining room meredith	sat down at his place and as always began teasing the young	waitress.	8.531906788375032
14031. he was asking had it been she who left the love note in his	sheets when he saw the gra^fin followed	by a stately blond girl approaching his table.	6.432078694055102
14032. it would be literary	license calculated to glamorize life to say that he oh dropped his napkin	so startled was he by mary jane's beauty.	10.502622063366099
14033. yet he did drop	his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the	gra^fin as acknowledgement that here indeed was something special.	5.757073359219529
14034. mary jane had made very little effort.	9.976645561536609
14035. above a dark green skirt	she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with as he soon perceived no	brassiere	beneath.	5.785887753336146
14036. her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight	down to her shoulders.	7.844158938913281
14037. perhaps her eyes were larger and more of	a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day.	6.045510598159413
14038. she had touched	her face truly a noble and pure face only with a lip salve which	made her lips glisten but no redder than usual.	7.201896671214908
14039. the result was grace	and modesty.	19.383268034242665
14040. as she was rather tired this evening her simple thank	you for the use of your bath- when she sat down opposite him-	spoken in a low voice came across with coolnesses of intelligence	and control.	7.889882426619853
14041. meredith began falling in love.	8.254441635698543
14042. soup: only	this	morning; veal cutlets: oh i couldn't possibly eat all	this!; wine: then you were typing poems this afternoon?	6.54093796655646
14043. ;	fruit compote: if you think i would understand it;	a smile.	7.176974652833388
14044. like h as if it were	built of books.	13.33776198089483
14045. having opened the windows onto the terrace	lit the fire translated the motto meredith grinned and took down	a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin.	4.925287201966392
14046. opening these	he brought out a schnapps bottle and small gold thimble-sized glasses	hidden inside it.	7.032105024464237
14047. i think the maids tipple in the afternoon.	13.753973431443153
14048. those sweet girls?	18.350640967888317
14049.  oh h you're joking.	11.02020549987394
14050. it tastes	a little like poppyseed.	18.949080935241245
14051. what's its name?	7.4788191822552905
14052.  steinha^ger h	she whispered steinha^ger to herself several times memorizing	it.	8.196044167676531
14053. would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me	read it to myself?	7.201621085577004
14054.  meredith's voice was always deep with rough	bass notes in it; in reading on platforms even in the large auditorium	of the ymha poetry center nights his voice	was intimate thoughtful and a trifle shy.	6.324025506973512
14055. his new poem a love poem	told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when	the lights in the house have failed.	6.126337135057605
14056. the husband points the steps	out with his flashlight: its white stare filling her pale eyes	to the blind brim with appetite bleaching her hands that grazed my	thighs and sent us from the table in surprise to let the dishes soak	all night	but he read on.	6.257566535480124
14057. in the bedroom	before the husband and wife find their way to the bed the lights go	on: in dull domestic radiance i watch her staring face still	blind start wincing in obedience to dirty waters counters pots	and pans waiting below stairs in her mind.	5.690924286841162
14058. mary jane took the	page from him and began reading it moving her lips with the words.	7.454291685747965
14059. oh it's that myth about orpheus and h what is her name?	6.404562209326707
14060. 	i can never pronounce it.	10.472119682746735
14061. the	third time rather urgently.	9.292919473889432
14062. but with her hand poem again.	18.634219542096755
14063. she raised	her face and nodded it's sweet and very sad.	7.533469760296565
14064. they discussed	the way people never tell each other the things on their minds.	8.619121390931282
14065. they	finished the small bottle of steinha^ger.	7.622507342753323
14066. she confessed she	was unhappy he asked was it her husband?	9.557448030765887
14067.  she began to explain there	was this poet in italy h he interrupted please don't	judge all poets.	6.097240078151911
14068. at her door two or three	hours later mary jane whispered everyone is asleep.	8.966909555978138
14069. kissing	her he whispered several times eurydice.	7.622507342753323
14070. the third time	rather urgently.	18.836986452152924
14071. but with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment	she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his	bed excited expectant and finally faintly grinning with the feel of	her hand against his mouth.	5.28976005683278
14072. they were west of the sabine but only god knew where.	11.832902629140206
14073. for three days their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley	as flat and featureless as a dead sea.	7.154916709066426
14074. molten glare singed their	eyelids an angry crimson; suffocating air sapped their strength and	strained their nerves to snapping; dust choked their throats and lay	like acid in their lungs.	5.950565555073685
14075. and the valley stretched endlessly out ahead	scorched and baked and writhing in its heat until it vanished into	the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze.	5.639624653248618
14076. ben prime extended	his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the	noses of the oxen.	6.757567981697296
14077. hoa-whup! he commanded from his raw throat	and felt the pain of movement in his cracked black burned lips.	5.491101831995351
14078. he removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through	the dust film upon his gaunt face.	8.282101326459884
14079. the dust-thick saliva came	from his mouth like balled cotton.	7.839212140222358
14080. he moved back to the wheel and	stood there blowing grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling	of his played-out limbs.	9.3084952053475
14081. the burning air dried his sweat-soaked clothes	in salt-edged patches.	7.839212140222358
14082. he cleared his throat and wet his	lips.	12.411802052220429
14083. as cheerfully as possible he said well i guess we could	all do with a little drink.	7.0627623956486625
14084. he unlashed the dipper and drew	water from a barrel.	10.697093789223626
14085. they could no longer afford the luxury of the	canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation.	8.399930257927952
14086. the water was warm and	stale and had a brackish taste.	10.049726853747186
14087. thank the lord	they still had water!   he cleansed his mouth with a small quantity.	7.058972978303228
14088. he took a long but carefully controlled draught.	13.767384096064125
14089. he replenished	the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck.	7.371407619110799
14090. she took it grudgingly her dark eyes baleful as they met his.	9.527242402020631
14091. she drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and	wipe her face.	6.257697475937866
14092. she set the dipper on the edge of the deck leaving	it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully.	9.401986637133355
14093. what happens when there's no more water?	9.428205570307522
14094.  she asked smolderingly.	29.24879875779148
14095. she was like charcoal he thought- dark opaque explosive.	9.118080733871818
14096. her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal.	9.230715364760899
14097. her temper	sparked like charcoal when it first lights up.	7.227998241277275
14098. and all the time she	had the heat of hatred in her like charcoal that is burning on its	under side but not visibly.	8.57951855139858
14099. a ripple ran through the muscles	of his jaws but he kept control upon his voice.	6.333521830024722
14100. there must	be some water under there.	17.252764190159947
14101. he tilted his homely face toward the	dry bed of the river.	7.560809233574742
14102. we can get it if we dig he said patiently.	12.460130694947848
14103. and add fever to our troubles?	10.242612813271945
14104.  she scoffed.	24.46901042456472
14105. or	do you want to see if i can stand fever too?	8.545277548980064
14106.    we can	boil it he said.	15.292242212242115
14107. we're lost and	burning up already she bit out tensely.	5.070587155952417
14108. the tires are rattling	on the wheels now.	11.387658710676023
14109. they'll roll off in another day.	5.405433653262936
14110. there was no	valley like this on your map.	18.60836034361733
14111. you don't even know where we're headed.	6.336973191735458
14112. hettie he said as gently as he could we're	still headed west.	8.082848192681366
14113. somewhere we'll hit a trail.	11.252233773442486
14114. maybe in time to make a cross and	dig our graves.	12.597458745199878
14115. in a way he couldn't	blame her.	17.988994686954427
14116. he had picked out this pathless trail instead of	the common one in a moment of romantic fancy to give them privacy on	their honeymoon.	8.50437179343183
14117. it had been a mistake but anything would have	been a mistake as it turned out.	9.785168431552664
14118. it wasn't the roughness and crudity	and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her.	9.459368085401477
14119. she had hated	the whole idea before they started.	9.965850596706412
14120. actually she had hated him before	she ever saw him.	9.383657739390097
14121. it had been five days too late before he learned	that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of	laudanum administered by her mother.	6.57363520288466
14122. the bitterness of their	wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound.	8.346523409839932
14123. she had jumped	away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder.	7.176940008513697
14124. he	had left her inviolate thinking familiarity would gentle her in time.	7.72979893245427
14125. but each mile westward she had hated him the deeper.	8.428791459982234
14126. he stared	at the dipper turning it over and over in his wide calloused hands.	9.755324442779786
14127. i suppose he muttered i can sell the outfit for enough	to send you home to your folks once we find a settlement.	6.131300679949594
14128. don't try to be noble! her laugh was hard.	4.095467031600027
14129. they	wouldn't	have sold me in the first place if there'd been food enough to	go around.	7.425671661355184
14130. hettie they didn't sell you	he said miserably.	9.060328853487057
14131. they knew i was a good sharecrop farmer back	in carolina but out west was a chance to build a real farm of our	own.	7.357944562647807
14132. they thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where	nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's	inside of them.	9.354234333633165
14133. without money or property what would you have	had at baton rouge?	6.487501039459089
14134.    i might have starved but at least	i wouldn't be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt!	he darkened under his heavy burn.	7.422450547630394
14135. his blue eyes sought the shimmering	sea of haze ahead.	7.18676379039501
14136. to his puzzlement there suddenly was	no	haze.	13.488429416017397
14137. the valley lay clear and open to the eye right up to the sharp-limbed	line of gaunt scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty	miles ahead.	6.367168058002272
14138. then he noticed the clouds racing upon them- heavy	ominous leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests	of the surrounding hills.	7.200742658340198
14139. he had never seen clouds like them before	but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before	a hurricane in carolina.	7.147588705105513
14140. he hollered hoarsely hang on!	and goaded the oxen as he yelled.	9.592132658614503
14141. he wanted to turn them putting	the wagon against the storm.	11.613195736337605
14142. too late he realized that in turning	he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground instead of atop a	grade or ridge.	7.159733441637952
14143. he swung up over the wheel.	10.776005861178222
14144. you had better	get inside he warned her.	13.503944917508555
14145. but she sat on in stubborn silence.	11.734329704926932
14146. the clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great	black funnel.	9.005093323721033
14147. frozen they stared at it whirling down the valley	gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving	hound dog cracking marrowbones.	4.853876284793092
14148. the six-ton conestoga began to whip	and shake.	11.387658710676023
14149. it was filled with dust	and wind and sound and violence.	13.455901699069877
14150. the heavens opened pelting them with	hail the size of walnuts.	12.13921281735145
14151. and then came the water- not rain but	solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket.	6.538805172169722
14152. walls	of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests	of flash floods.	6.886249538313906
14153. through the splash of the rising waters they could	hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon gnashing	big chunks out of the banks.	6.923441822319746
14154. the jetting frothing surface of	the river reached the level of the runoff.	11.166531352574001
14155. the dangerous current upon	the prairie ceased but the water stood and kept on rising.	6.374057384651866
14156. they cringed	under sodden covers listening to the waves slop against the bottom.	8.949441394945763
14157. the cloudburst cut off abruptly.	10.915477388587384
14158. they were engulfed by	the weird silence broken only by the low angry murmur of the river.	9.697317352715666
14159. then the darkness thinned and there was light again and then bright	sunlight.	8.942908300635478
14160. beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill they	crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water	that reached clear to the surrounding hills.	6.39637505592769
14161. the water level was	higher than their hubs.	9.733451291571583
14162. only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored.	10.662680805176791
14163. there was no real sign of the river now just a roiling	oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere.	8.331779640695295
14164. clumps of brush rode down the ribbon.	9.060328853487057
14165. now and then the glistening	side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past.	7.62923376882146
14166. the girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine hugging	her shoulders and still trembling.	8.396158890934128
14167. her face was pale but set and	her dark eyes smoldered with blame for ben.	6.011107199869389
14168. out of compulsion	to say something cheery ben prime blurted well we were lucky	to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit.	8.24634362700392
14169. at least the wheels	dug in.	18.28714596439191
14170. the soaking will put life back in the wagon too.	11.014922667787763
14171. his wife didn't give a sign she'd heard.	7.591810951946381
14172. she was watching a	tree ride wildly down that roiling current.	10.850667502179856
14173. somebody was riding the	tree.	9.625903376260457
14174. it raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair sitting	astride an upright branch.	10.241172080199354
14175. she did not call out.	12.273782314519758
14176. but as	the tree passed she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell.	8.462543828796642
14177. they watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend.	7.361387642831033
14178. it speared	up into the air then sinking back the up-jutting branch turned	slowly.	11.557530636230211
14179. the pale blob of the woman disappeared.	10.18169945788728
14180. there's	the one who's lucky! the girl murmured harshly.	8.581436094141479
14181. ben's	eyes strained with the bitter hurt his homely face slashed with gray	and crimson.	5.674295354649883
14182. then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into	the water to talk with the beasts needing their comfort more than they	needed his.	7.8006144285167345
14183. it was nearly sundown and he went to the back of	the wagon half-swimming his way for he was not a tall man.	9.746593201055227
14184. he let	down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water.	9.310968165605255
14185. he sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of	seed grain forward.	7.463738624816407
14186. they were already swollen to bursting.	15.114646011925606
14187. of all	their worldly	belongings next to the oxen and his gun the seed grain had been	the most treasured.	6.826324619602437
14188. it was spoiled now for seed and it would sour	and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry	it.	9.452146487398206
14189. the oxen might as well enjoy it.	8.976097203071156
14190. he examined the water marks	on the iron tires when the animals were finished.	8.824820353737188
14191. the waters lay	muddy but placid without a ripple of movement against the wheels; there	was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding.	5.364324501728104
14192. he doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate dry hills	that rimmed the valley.	10.910277501292645
14193. a terrible numbing sense of futility swept	over him.	8.023923068000494
14194. he gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of	defeat.	11.41751650402562
14195. then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen.	8.498879576433923
14196. the spokes were tight again the iron tires gripped onto the wheels	as if of one piece.	7.663024046550707
14197. he swung toward	the front	to give the news to hettie then stopped barred from her by	the vehemence of her blame and hate.	5.8202655376519825
14198. a tight	wagon meant so much.	13.150214475214955
14199. he got a small fire started and put on bacon	and coffee.	9.39392204388399
14200. he poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour	salvaging the chunky watery messes for biscuits of a sort.	7.632256702457449
14201. their	jams and jellies had not suffered.	7.622507342753323
14202. he found a jar of preserved tomatoes	and one of eggs that they had meant to save.	9.343584694836002
14203. now he broke them open	hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing hettie.	7.381880541043617
14204. his long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating	java but the fire was low and he wanted to waste no time.	7.259414770019016
14205. he	furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins leaving the ribs and	wagon open.	6.984473060183216
14206. he looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk holding	her meager treasures.	10.090191208524187
14207. he said hesitantly hettie i don't	figure your things got wet too much.	8.994991984681759
14208. if you	want to get them aired h   she said without turning her head	after that rain beating in atop the dust there isn't a thing	that won't be streaked.	7.201555911575075
14209. he drew a long breath and opened	the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs.	5.909009505545415
14210. sulphur oil and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams	of.	8.317849161376156
14211. i suppose a lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold	and touched off the blaze.	7.153983313781811
14212. now roaring up in great oily clouds of	smoke and flames the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where	we huddled like suffocating sheep not knowing what to do h.	7.560841011802532
14213. the lifeboats were stuck fast.	10.915477388587384
14214. i heard a	cry from a stoker as a pillar of flame leaped from a hatch and tongued	the man's bare back.	7.522145522111613
14215. he sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard	into the shark-infested waters.	7.775583501842191
14216. one especially bad detonation	shook lifeboat no 3 which trembled violently in the davits.	9.282849063553165
14217. brassnose	yelled: come on sommers max h step on it we got	a chance now.	5.674295354649883
14218. heave on those ropes; the boat's come unstuck.	8.581436094141479
14219. we pulled and swore and yanked and wept scraping our hands until	they bled profusely.	6.6981788258569415
14220. the bonaventure was quivering and lurching	like an old spavined mare.	9.430036403335416
14221. her stern was down and a sharp list helped	us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water.	5.332282571578817
14222. brassnose max and i leaped into the sea and swam to the	boat.	7.391013650626644
14223. let's get away fast said brassnose shaking water from	his mop of bleached hair.	5.146046505428776
14224. that tub is going to explode all at once.	12.934039843488424
14225. then the bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a	roar of live steam geysers of sparks and flames and a dense cloud of	black-and-orange smoke.	5.738441069735935
14226. dimly we heard the voices of men in mortal	agony but we couldn't go back into that inferno.	7.339590367127657
14227. already our	leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water.	7.902746023578669
14228. sommers you	bale while we row brassnose commanded.	9.060328853487057
14229. as best as i could	determine we were some 700 miles west of new guinea in the bismark	archipelago.	6.549163141039472
14230. three days previously we had steamed past barren	rennell island in the distance.	8.58921141390246
14231. now we peered anxiously for any speck	of land in the pacific for this interminable bailing would have	to stop soon.	7.418522707971578
14232. there were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands;	our muscles were hot wires of pain.	9.886551982809529
14233. the big man with the whitened hair murmured something: his	words sounded as if they were in the manu tongue which i recognized	having studied the dialect in my anthropology 6 class at the	university of chicago.	6.602407885286595
14234. he then said something which struck	a chord in my memory.	11.391436565245405
14235. god help us if we're near the island	of eromonga.	7.619396145973677
14236. we'd be in real trouble then.	7.954778816520607
14237. i'd rather keep bailing-	or sink.	5.384636745418132
14238. i was puzzled by the remark then i recalled	the voice of mild professor howard griggs three years ago in a	university lecture on primitive societies.	8.758551005410588
14239. he had been speaking of this	archipelago:   even when the islands were under german	mandate before world war 1 europeans gave eromonga a wide berth.	7.552412834744429
14240. the place is inhabited by several hundred warlike women who are	anachronisms of the twentieth century- stone age amazons who live	in an all-female matriarchal society which is self-sufficient.	7.942508260145998
14241. i remembered too the jesting voice of a classmate bobby pauson:	but how do they reproduce dr griggs?	6.230740482791928
14242.  i'm sure that	males have something to do with that process!   there had	been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as professor griggs said	dryly: i see your point pauson.	5.385733871897865
14243. of course males play a role	there but believe me when i say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one	bit on eromonga.	6.835771776832589
14244. indeed you wouldn't live long for the females	either drive the men they've seized from neighboring islands back	to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes or they destroy	them by revolting but ingenious methods.	6.002765404429641
14245. in fact one important	aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men.	8.207400058614645
14246. i	think i know what you mean brassnose i said.	8.86738543608648
14247. i know something	about eromonga.	18.393652376116847
14248. let's hope we come to a safer place.	8.608875829665614
14249. three hours later while we were bailing desperately	a dot of land came into view.	6.201237449035561
14250. foster lukuklu frayne made a	sign over his heart with his two linked thumbs: i recognized it as	an ancient manu gesture intended to propitiate the devil.	6.046219493410928
14251. a	half-hour passed; we had drifted closer.	7.622507342753323
14252. in a voice so frightened as	to seem not his own the big bo'sun's mate quavered:   tchalo!	it is eromonga- look hard you can see with your	naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff.	7.2823273848983705
14253. i squinted	at the looming shoreline.	12.384361145835424
14254. there was a wooden tower or derrick there	something like a ski jump; it was perhaps 80 feet high and had	been artfully constructed of logs.	9.084560030287264
14255. a fine example of engineering in	a primitive society.	8.023923068000494
14256. what is the scaffolding for brassnose?	20.064188224348324
14257. 	he made a sound of despair deep in his throat.	6.522694886689917
14258. it was	embarrassing to see strapping blonde brassnose comport himself like	a child who talks about bogeymen.	9.119726373603218
14259. aaa-ee! it is their	tultul the 'jumping platform' of death.	6.460370037324521
14260. it is the last of the	three tests of manhood which the women impose to discover if a male	in worthy of survival there.	10.000223381730885
14261. often i heard my uncles and cousins speak	of it when i was a small boy growing up in rabaul.	6.69556302158483
14262. they had never	seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers.	10.485976319234352
14263. our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what i had	heard of the inhabitants of eromonga i was glad to see a long and	graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon	into the open sea and toward our craft.	5.05873924492434
14264. i expected brassnose-	as a man with a strain of melanesian in his blood- to speak to	them.	9.994030170667553
14265. but he had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked.	10.51934454174966
14266. so i mustered my few words of the manu dialect and	said we greet you in peace.	9.106611412615775
14267. my friends and i	come from a ship which was destroyed by fire.	6.591695846496977
14268. we are thirsty and hungry;	our sore and burned hands and arms need attention.	9.796060505498925
14269. the	girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me.	5.427950274147271
14270. i noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland	of red pandanus fruit in her blue-black hair.	8.33386119992804
14271. she said my	name is songau and these girls are ponkob and piwen.	7.905131466207428
14272. you are welcome	to eromonga.	24.8016390362868
14273. my people await you on the shore.	7.979268300280018
14274. you shall have	food water and rest.	15.000064054538505
14275. thirty minutes later the outrigger grated	on sand and other girls waiting on shore rushed forward to pull	it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder.	5.958272222839456
14276. i saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there.	11.998711924395053
14277. all my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished	at the sight.	6.328889063546105
14278. there was a mound of bleached human bones and skulls	at the base of the big wooden derrick.	13.381811013043777
14279. some had been there for years;	others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them.	6.257321839180515
14280. there was one object which sickened yet fascinated me.	17.845115652066244
14281. this	was also a corpse- a male judging from the coral arm bands the	tribal scars still discernible on the maggoty face the painted bone of	the warrior caste which still pierced the septum of the rotting nose.	4.490550208757949
14282. the body may have been two or three weeks' dead.	13.952553632584415
14283. i looked	with revulsion at the legs.	10.981588546931944
14284. many small bones protruded	crazily from the shreds of flesh.	9.810183381807354
14285. the man must have leaped to	his death from the topmost rung of the tultul.	7.544436744082754
14286. as if divining	my thoughts the girl songau smiled warmly and said in the casual	tone an american woman might use in describing her rose garden:	this is our tultul a jumping platform maku.	6.967639549562533
14287. later	you shall know it better.	8.254441635698543
14288. is it not well-made?	31.93144804375565
14289.  our old one blew	down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons	ago.	8.626842879291733
14290. it took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one	which is higher and stronger than the old one.	8.288605800987535
14291. we are very proud of	it.	14.770904988036797
14292. you have every right to be i replied gravely in	the manu dialect but my attention was fixed on brassnose the biggest	and strongest of us.	8.026215261487973
14293. he looked as if he was going to keel over.	18.278692413222853
14294. i	felt a queasiness in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these	girls that we were afraid.	6.712960091072817
14295. i clapped	the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily	hoping it would make an impression on the women: this one is the	maku frayne.	5.606590210459183
14296. he speaks your language too for he is the grandson	of a chieftain on taui who made much magic and was strong and cunning.	7.728070142423507
14297. the maku frayne has inherited this strength from his grandfather.	7.43304005989246
14298. this was the worst thing i could have said.	14.644855046938748
14299. brassnose	turned a stricken face toward me and said brokenly sommers you	meddling yank you're a fool! they despise males who brag of	their strength; they destroy such men with their damned tests.	4.595688357851942
14300. you've	ruined me blast you!   at first i thought he was out	of his head talking wildly like this.	8.036634418028957
14301. but a glance at songau and	the other women confirmed what brassnose had blurted out.	7.571120215147129
14302. the	women's faces had hardened after my statement.	9.060328853487057
14303. at a nod from songau	four lithe and muscular girls darted to frayne's side and seized	him by the arms.	6.749665528123199
14304. the man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle;	but four eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest	male that ever lived.	8.035993325699133
14305. besides terror had sapped some of frayne's	vitality and will.	7.191898224116614
14306. my last impression as they led him off to	a stockade was of his pale face   in the manu tongue eromonga	means manhood- a quality which the women derisively toasted	in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were	imbibed.	5.908804940970449
14307. in the hut to which i was assigned- max had his own quarters-	my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping	breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases.	5.472356956394343
14308. her name was l'turu and she told me many things.	8.745349295385674
14309. for	an anthropologist loquacious old l'turu was a mine of information.	6.210871206873012
14310. though i had a great dread of the island and felt i would never	leave it alive i eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its	women.	7.242514368110943
14311. from l'turu	i heard that until about 1850 the people of this island- which	was about the size of guam or smaller- had been of both sexes	and that the normal family life of melanesian tribes was observed here	with minor variations.	5.65119743189306
14312. but in the middle of the last century	an island woman named karipo seized a spear in the heat of an	inter-tribal	battle and rallied the women after their men had fled.	10.847783280636335
14313. miraculously	karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders	from the isle of pamasu back to their war canoes after considerable	loss of life on both sides.	5.099268430970915
14314. karipo was something of a	politician as well as a militarist.	10.691322327860746
14315. she quickly exploited the exalted	position she now occupied by harassing the disorganized males and even	putting many of them to death.	6.784343870885159
14316. within a decade or less few men	were left and a feminist society had sprung up.	8.718137106508035
14317. karipo was	great goddess told our mothers that men were not necessary except to	father children the crone told me.	5.15576524365156
14318. all men went away from here.	12.414000739217707
14319. those who stayed had to pass tests.	10.800215858022893
14320. she cackled with	mirth showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth.	10.090117903264954
14321. karipo's women	then named this place 'eromonga'- manhood- for just the strongest	men could stay here.	5.542917982132687
14322. the old woman	arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood.	8.558239973125177
14323. in	the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling i saw four	figures in a semi-circle on the ground.	6.305505056831967
14324. i guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized	then headed for home.	8.923469128060672
14325. maybe to beat up on his squaw.	8.392121578401147
14326. benson looked	up and saw ramey's long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the	stiff edge of the overall bib.	6.960961743939457
14327. ramey reached out with the tire iron	and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack.	5.0176589645046334
14328. i'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't	understand the liquor or automobiles.	7.882449848301349
14329. somehow the thought of a simple	man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand	moved the driver.	6.265198626892353
14330. for a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless	drivers softened.	13.814973261141416
14331. maybe the indian wasn't too much at fault	ramey thought.	7.405448611723711
14332. maybe he was only doing the best he knew how like any	of us.	10.097909176048137
14333. anyway he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be	stared at.	7.720383262934474
14334. ever see yourself spread out on the pavement benny?	11.908099658038516
14335. 	he said to his partner.	8.254441635698543
14336. you mean dream?	24.616003681853215
14337. 	not exactly.	12.292407525564322
14338. benson grinned and flipped a rock	with his thumb like a marble.	7.615092762846159
14339. nope just you all the time-	sometimes i think it's the only way i'll ever get a decent	partner.	6.051837838257081
14340. ramey smiled but he thought to himself i always	see me too.	7.615092762846159
14341. whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt	ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out	thoughts in his own mind.	5.183722086645692
14342. then he would realize they were really things	that only he himself could think.	9.229246084724402
14343. with this realization sometimes	he saw himself as he looked down.	8.655964310385567
14344. you seen him yet?	20.025453829488345
14345. 	benson said referring to the indian.	7.622507342753323
14346. he wasn't in the	car ramey said.	13.671139498061125
14347. you didn't go clear around benson	said.	11.823504411807077
14348. if you want to see something he's back on the other	side by the trunk of the car.	13.659590822744175
14349. too long a waiting line	ramey answered pretending to joke.	8.556786814027822
14350. a few minutes later the	insurance man a road checker drove up in the gray coupe with license	plates on it from a far-away state.	9.008524249317492
14351. it was a trick they used to try	and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their	speed.	8.347512756127648
14352. sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar	on the trucks as they passed.	11.04553619652152
14353. all the drivers knew about the plates	and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges	the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping	cane.	5.488588032932596
14354. horsely an agent on the east end wore the hat trying to	look like a tourist.	7.817780933850147
14355. it had always seemed strange to ramey that to	disguise himself as a tourist an ex-truck driver like horsely would	merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head.	6.318413943622678
14356. the insurance	man informed them that he had talked to crumley who was all	right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they	towed the rig back to town.	7.855320008317608
14357. he chatted with ramey and benson for a	minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer.	7.07855947270958
14358. every so often the	diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for	the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear.	6.779972761280906
14359. when they	were ready to leave benson and ramey walked back around the rear of	the trailer.	6.526302640247175
14360. there's a body you won't mind looking at	benson said and they stopped.	4.705349682081825
14361. she had driven up with her husband	in a convertible with eastern license plates although the two drivers	knew nothing at the moment about that.	6.5591772342842205
14362. she wore shorts and a loose	terry-cloth shirt.	15.017256448999191
14363. slender and tanned her dark brown hair was drawn	straight back simply.	6.002446559592496
14364. what outfit does she drive for?	13.126227377958582
14365. 	benson said.	12.292407525564322
14366. seeing her caused a lurch in ramey a recognition.	8.3386589614121
14367. she might have been someone he had once loved.	8.896420218978632
14368. he had never seen	her before but now he thought of the manner in which he and benson	went in and out of the cities at each end of their run.	13.322174237404848
14369. the truck	routes the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed	briefly through his mind- back alleys were their access to a city	and they could never stay.	5.320665836557362
14370. how would you ever see her again?	11.436703851707046
14371.  the feeling	subsided it was only a small yearning.	10.3670005637198
14372. what's she doing in this bunch?	7.696030501807653
14373.  benson said and ramey	wondered how close their thoughts might have been.	6.002446559592496
14374. the girl	looked around at the countryside.	13.722420979343108
14375. her glance swung past the trailer	where the two drivers were standing.	6.6158785931347355
14376. it made only a tiny bump over	the two	men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on.	9.752993970019805
14377. she began	to watch a blonde-haired man also in shorts standing right at the rear	of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured	slightly.	6.404717792677268
14378. what had caught his attention was obscured by the car	itself so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see but	benson knew what it was.	6.639530558332868
14379. the girl took a couple of steps toward the	man in shorts when benson in that barefoot courtliness ramey could	never decide was real said you don't want to go around there	ma'am.	5.117016339236602
14380. the girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge	that someone had spoken to her.	8.224299710418066
14381. the man stood near the bent	levi-clad body of the indian who lay face down almost under the car.	7.443421218832237
14382. the two drivers moved closer.	16.15139276424356
14383. what does he want a spoon?	16.63115694863498
14384. 	benson said to ramey.	11.568363037656766
14385. one tiny detail in a happening can	clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth while the rest	of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain.	5.518638500826992
14386. with ramey it was	a dusty work shoe that was half-off the indian's foot that he would	always remember.	7.694325626363309
14387. the laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets	but there was still a bow knot at the top.	8.612933911532794
14388. the slightest twitch would	have parted the shoe entirely from the foot yet the toes were still	inside.	7.663024046550707
14389. the two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed	man.	8.80703018325433
14390. he wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red v	at the neck the sleeves pushed above the elbows.	8.593152378739592
14391. he turned and looked	at them with clear blue eyes immaculate eyes.	8.33521559366383
14392. he was very tanned-	big hands might have torn him from a coca-cola poster.	10.473068827911414
14393. he's	dead isn't he?	10.363724110347151
14394.  the man said.	29.050065562200892
14395. he turned and bent over	the body of the indian.	10.19218448547381
14396. there was nothing in particular on the man's	face.	19.087668903820976
14397. it was simply a matter of curiosity a natural right to examine.	11.712901388855265
14398. what's this?	10.658282670269122
14399.  the man said backing up a step	still looking down.	9.900138948499714
14400. his words were mostly to himself.	11.107172507795411
14401. there was a gentle concern in benson's voice.	16.087164523244187
14402. ramey looked	down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man's tanned	leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded blood-flecked substance lying by	itself on the pavement.	8.018348078589597
14403. but what is it?	21.829909576381876
14404.  the man said	with a tone of impatience.	15.0049315879907
14405. but what is it?	21.829909576381876
14406.  the man had	spoken only once.	19.40042907621881
14407. ramey heard the words again inside weakened the	way moving water sounds through a grove of trees until he was not sure	whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears.	4.884247545634503
14408. the sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and ramey's	vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man's	leg.	7.036904278699971
14409. ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown	skin.	6.002446559592496
14410. he stared at the shining shining circles of hairs and heard the	voice of his partner through trees don't do that fella.	7.224429306063447
14411. the man seemed to sink a little as ramey brought	the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde	head was turning as he hit the man again with his fist.	5.484130496195946
14412. ramey swung	and caught the man just to the left of his mouth.	8.722155617533776
14413. it was a straight	solid once-in-a-lifetime shot; he laid all four knuckles in between	the man's cheekbone and his chin.	7.9856397667013885
14414. ramey's fist and the air expelled	from the man's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like	cupped hands clapping together.	7.076583579949375
14415. the man took two short steps	backward then sat down heavily on the pavement.	7.864590117251196
14416. ramey heard a cry from	the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand.	6.886249538313906
14417. as he watched	the man sit suddenly a detached part of his mind observed how very	difficult it was really to knock a man off his feet.	6.0471368100683005
14418. he hadn't	done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard.	10.26553299192532
14419. with a thoughtful look the man sat on the pavement legs straight out	in front of him.	6.752806235637263
14420. his arms hung like empty shirt sleeves and his mouth	was slightly open.	8.059409733643921
14421. after what seemed several seconds the open mouth	grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it.	6.017016620271997
14422. the man brought	one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he	touched his mouth.	8.6524634224972
14423. he moaned and pulled the hand away.	9.783357976961607
14424. even yet there	was no realization in his eyes.	10.918598433440833
14425. ramey could hear the crowd	coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his	shoulder had no identity or importance to him.	5.204869115757404
14426. he did not look around.	25.79198636437355
14427. he's hurt!	a woman's voice said and then he heard a sort of wail from	the man's wife.	4.495487867147494
14428. the man on the ground began to move; one of his	hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him.	10.480157050005326
14429. blood dripped	down the front of his sweater soaking into a dark streak of dirt that	ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder as though the	bright v woven into the neckline had melted running a darker color.	4.846636707361931
14430. the girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back.	9.111920854589842
14431. can you hear can you talk to me?	9.665774586184202
14432.  she begged.	24.46901042456472
14433. an incoherent	puzzled sound came from the red mouth.	9.60473226070196
14434. the girl looked around quickly	at several of the people.	11.72976309525147
14435. none of the crowd had stepped forward to	help.	11.982888423448527
14436. then she saw ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment.	9.852425697342511
14437. why did you do it- why did you hit him?	8.675342235361066
14438.  she said	her voice rising.	16.217963900265392
14439. a shine in her eyes suddenly	became tears and she turned back to her husband again.	6.046198409504693
14440. behind	ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers.	9.060328853487057
14441. no one seemed	to know for sure what had happened nor was there any purpose or responsibility	in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver	beyond finding out.	5.792565171936956
14442. ramey looked around and caught sight of his	partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman.	7.293003941017387
14443. benson moved his arms gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and	talking rapidly.	6.002446559592496
14444. ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man.	10.040701579037144
14445. some of	the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at ramey.	6.575849564990497
14446. it's	all over now the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk	rapidly down along the trailer toward them.	6.841586933117374
14447. ramey watched him coming	with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer.	5.683862278661536
14448. he saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman's	swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and	rolled at the side of his stocky body the sun left a smoky shine on	the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of	his pistol.	0.0
14449. all right step back! the patrolman said	to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball	cap and a young boy in levis.	6.073918125755855
14450. he walked straight up to the man sitting	on the ground and bent over to look at him.	12.327741674524873
14451. you all right?	19.40307901854524
14452. 	mough- it's my mough the man said trying	to talk without moving his lips.	7.198778874655976
14453. his brown face looked gray from dirt	streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across	it.	5.398794248435963
14454. then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the	venomous head- caught in the wicker back of the chair the eyes dead	on him as the life finally went out of the brute.	7.8220697285300185
14455. the body continued	to lash but now keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome	bloody mass out of the bungalow.	6.630839010843071
14456. he slammed the door and listened	as his servants ran up alarmed at the sound of the shots.	8.95598149192629
14457. he heard	their chattering and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered	the snake right on the porch with wood axes.	7.437803032165524
14458. it was only then	that he turned to look at penny.	21.52399993554889
14459. she was sitting on the edge	of the bed again back in the same position where the snake had found	her.	8.214373219292316
14460. the fear had not entirely gone from her face but there were some	other emotions now crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth.	7.974410341588859
14461. but her hands were calm now.	12.726227658933269
14462. she's got guts thought	keith.	7.796297918591952
14463. she's got more guts than any other woman in the world.	5.276400593923195
14464. keith said penny keith you were wonderful.	9.060328853487057
14465. i	don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving	her life but i am.	5.553125311222
14466. he smiled at her	sincerity.	21.207006403000655
14467. and for the hundredth time that week he was startled at her	beauty.	9.142356591530243
14468. seven years they'd been married.	13.544196933749038
14469. he knew her	mind pretty well by now its quick perceptions and sympathies its painful	insistence on truth and directness its capacity for love almost	too deep for a man to reciprocate even in part.	6.13612019295596
14470. but her beauty always	surprised him anew.	16.145317277169504
14471. i realize that this is hardly the time	to say it penny said keith.	9.175072870500442
14472. but knowing you i know that	you're glad to be alive and grateful- and sorry because i killed	the snake even though i had to.	7.119178297382892
14473. isn't that so?	5.466376808403582
14474.    penny	lowered her eyes.	13.148092146312546
14475. yes she said almost in a whisper	as if admitting to a crime.	6.610748631250655
14476. the snake was beautiful wasn't	it?	13.848082117783294
14477.  asked keith his voice getting harsher in spite of himself	as he struggled to control his growing anger.	6.317271579176422
14478. it was a king	cobra the largest you ever saw and it deserved to live out its life	in the jungle didn't it?	9.244302527801475
14479.  didn't it?	12.292407525564322
14480. 	penny	did not answer.	13.148092146312546
14481. now she just sat there looking at him without an expression	except concern for him.	6.2879820389029115
14482. we're all god's creatures	aren't we?	7.3804064617970475
14483.  keith was snarling now.	9.118533821976325
14484. all of us- every	goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle.	10.717657477741565
14485. you love this village	and these stinking brown people because they're god's creatures	too.	7.665003147107107
14486. and you love ahmiri that black bastard of a servant even	a little more because he's a beautiful man.	8.664869755279504
14487. and he loves you because	you're a beautiful woman.	10.426028268248071
14488. we're all god's creatures aren't	we penny?	7.058068392390303
14489.  all of us that is except me.	14.615459633812165
14490. you hate me you	hate my guts because i like to hunt.	11.74762347648697
14491. you actually hate me- and we	both know it- because i killed that filthy snake.	7.073823370696189
14492. h well why don't	you	say something?	12.839946158968015
14493.    penny would not rise to his mood.	7.14162538120728
14494. there isn't anything left to say is there keith?	12.793802081235478
14495. 	she softly let herself into the bed and took her regular side	away from the door where she slept better because keith was between	her and the invader.	4.855572261109377
14496. he knew she was not sulking not even angry at	him.	13.669327716041765
14497. just as he knew that she had stopped loving him.	12.303876378486995
14498. the brahmaputra	has its headwaters in the tableland of the world the towering	white headwalls of the himalayas that are unknown to man as any	other space on the planet.	7.985971070036899
14499. for a brief period each year the rays of	the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep	at the base of the headwalls and then the pinnacles glisten in the	daytime at high noon and billions of gallons of water begin their slow	seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys	on their long meandering journey to the sea- running east past the	sky-carving massifs of gurla mandhata and kemchenjunga then turning	south and curling down through the jungles of assam past the khasi	hills and into bengal past sirinjani and madaripur until the	hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields	and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the	bay of bengal.	4.5260378129053835
14500. keith sterling had looked down on the brahmaputra	more times than he could remember during the war days when	he flew over the hump of the world thinking it high adventure in those	times before man was guiding himself through outer space.	6.9201762169355145
14501. but keith	looked down more than up.	12.522280549824776
14502. he thought of the jungles below him and	of the wild strange untracked beauty there and he promised himself	that someday he would return on foot perhaps to hunt in this last corner	of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted and animals	the lords.	6.593641122314151
14503. at first it had been just a romantic dream of his	the same as the idea of finishing oxford after the war.	7.289488855961657
14504. but after	the war was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself.	10.10655610959952
14505. wing	commanders in the raf do not imply survival in the future either	in their orders or in their attitudes to their men or to themselves.	5.127047344343866
14506. and keith's record of kills made him a man to listen to- a	man paradoxically who might even survive.	8.467531012847303
14507. he became a fighter pilot	after the stint over the hump in the big crates.	7.698031307125171
14508. the raf was britain's	weapon of attrition and flying a fighter plane was the way	her sons could serve her best at this point in the war.	8.112461597640973
14509. he knew	how to shoot down nazis.	10.776005861178222
14510. and he knew that the men talked about him	behind his back saying that he was one up on everybody else- including	the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it- because he was	chemically incapable of fear.	8.209283960969968
14511. that was true but only half the truth.	10.315313391184581
14512. the other half he didn't like to recognize even to himself.	11.757907923309139
14513. not defending england or being an ace or fighting	for humanity.	7.545193944393053
14514. and he would have enjoyed it	just as much if he had been a nazi.	14.978109534205874
14515. nowadays we talk as though	the blitz were just a short skirmish.	6.063398628075623
14516. the nazis bombed britain	so the raf retaliated and shot them all down.	8.649006242526841
14517. it	was a war of nerves of stamina of dogged endurance in which the stupid	insistence of the british on their right to their own country became	ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the nazis who were better	organized and technically superior.	5.3931104354385155
14518. it took a long time before the	british tipped the balance.	17.44642972928925
14519. keith learned too much about air	combat and air killing to be risked.	6.171535667146162
14520. they grounded him	and put	him	in the command offices.	11.967541482367666
14521. that was where he met penny.	12.647977126226007
14522. he was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking american wac	a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work	in the command offices	but that was all.	7.84592359593414
14523. penny knew him better on her part.	7.14162538120728
14524. he had a war	reputation but this was the kind of man women like even without medals.	12.477662440032754
14525. they don't go for bull-like muscle as a rule.	5.3090465830112485
14526. he had strength	in his six-foot frame but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier.	10.416387373714832
14527. he was on the thin side with big hands and the kind of wrists that	give away the power in forearm and bicep.	8.158257085838253
14528. his hair was black	already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom the only	one permitted to a man.	6.966023347421749
14529. the pretty little twittering wacs said	he had the look of eagles- and penny hating the cliche had to	admit that in this case it applied.	6.093007126642246
14530. penny	and keith had no romance.	10.472119682746735
14531. but they met	in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly.	8.90568767080641
14532. the command offices were in the border country up north where the	radar systems centralized their intelligence reports and the fighters	were dispatched to harry the enemy.	7.496811183961292
14533. the nazis knew this of course	and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers they let	a few drop every time they went over hoping for a lucky hit.	5.082040154899867
14534. this	time they had been lucky.	12.257203192463184
14535. the command post was underground and	well camouflaged.	10.190933876022052
14536. but there hadn't been enough time to build it for	keeps.	14.476850121589298
14537. there was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and	ceiling but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that	concrete is not much better than prayer if as efficacious when a	direct hit comes along.	6.520942577898514
14538. this one was actually more of a near	miss.	15.721847479315333
14539. the bomb plunged into the ground near the post but not	precisely into the command room itself.	6.3023106167478975
14540. there was a shattering cracking	sound as the concrete started to buckle the air filled with dust	and flying debris and everyone in the room- men and women hit the	floor and used the desks as turtlebacks as ordered.	7.640907069713991
14541. that is	everyone but keith and penny.	10.445007602079077
14542. they stood there just the two	of them in the rocking shattering blast.	10.252517073994134
14543. keith was on his feet because	he didn't care at all about life any more: penny on her feet	proudly because she cared too much.	5.2308841128809735
14544. the bomb was a solitary	one.	14.571826934029374
14545. the blast damaged but did not destroy the room.	8.380282401201281
14546. keith's eyes	met penny's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction.	7.198778874655976
14547. and as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks	and tend to those wounded and mark the several killed he climbed across	the debris to penny and took her hand in his.	6.166683140436403
14548. the chaplain	married them on the next day.	13.741647621726068
14549. after the war penny had wanted	keith at least to visit her home with her.	8.980821844501543
14550. she came from ohio	from what she called a small farm of two hundred acres as indeed	it was to farmer-type farmers.	7.367446187496744
14551. but to keith's london-bred mind	such acreage sounded rather invincible.	10.245818995913254
14552. it wasn't that however which	decided them not to go to america.	15.044482527920024
14553. keith told penny about his	dream to return to india and burma.	7.171634360000144
14554. he stressed the wild beauty of	the mountains and the jungles.	11.443598571584346
14555. he didn't tell her the truth he now	freely admitted to himself.	5.3099934912047395
14556. that was his	true love not penny.	16.04604357945442
14557. the terrible power of a gun the thing that	blasted the soul out of a living body man or beast was one he never	wanted to lose.	5.850140650460991
14558. and in the hunting land this hunger was considered	to be a noble thing.	11.58498098678022
14559. when they got to shillong in assam	he was happy.	10.07323882946346
14560. this is a paradise for hunters.	23.09974087017306
14561. this was the land of the	sladang the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the	spread.	7.932064572431268
14562. the sambur buck the jungle stag	that is even more noble than the scottish elk.	8.432100551633715
14563. he even hunted elephant	although the asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his african	cousin.	6.979609923919594
14564. but there are big rogues in both countries.	20.551409567393584
14565. these were	the ones keith sought out- the loners the ones who killed for the	joy of it like himself.	5.826509540264318
14566. he and penny would go out on tame elephants	raised from babyhood in the keddah.	9.484063867867984
14567. and while he was ever	alert for game and most particularly a tiger penny marvelled at the	eden they were traversing.	7.304906375504845
14568. they came upon cheetal deer at woodland	pools.	12.993060342901307
14569. peacocks strutted across their path preening.	7.622507342753323
14570. there were fantastic	flowers without perfume and gaudy birds without song.	13.569916570911658
14571. mouse	deer played around the feet of the elephants or fled when the mighty	legs thrashed too close.	5.852830941119954
14572. wild boar watched their progress with little	pig eyes and grunted derision when they didn't consider such game	worthy of a shot from the .	6.157942065974489
14573. now the next morning they were anchored at the elbow and the boat	was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned	to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms	with the weighted line beside it; and robinson roy who had gone	down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free	dive was already back on the surface.	4.580724262688454
14574. he and his safety man	herr schaffner swam up to the boarding ladder together.	12.126584538941803
14575. the german	courteously indicated that robinson should mount first.	8.341215694113531
14576. robinson	clambered heavily into the boat sat down and stripped off his triple-tank	assembly.	7.391013650626644
14577. he took his mask from his forehead	and threw it unexpectedly across the deck.	7.535105389246928
14578. temper temper	mrs forsythe said laughing uneasily.	9.670406878971576
14579. a phony blonde hanging	onto a bygone youth and beauty but irreparably stringy in the neck	she was already working on her second gin and tonic though it was	not yet ten am   i loused it rob said with a	savage note in his voice.	4.568236200897365
14580. all i have to do to set the record is to	go on down.	13.57853215182451
14581. so instead i come up.	10.876002516440062
14582. was it my equipment?	20.172991344965638
14583. 	the german asked.	10.363724110347151
14584. was it something went bad with the breathing?	12.432512407677752
14585. 	the equipment was fine rob stated standing	up.	7.14162538120728
14586. he was a huge young man of twenty-four clothed in muscle immensely	strong with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that	was submerged under his present agitation.	7.8202783587564015
14587. he stared stonily at the	floor.	12.127026643485452
14588. i was down to 275.	19.226205200417645
14589. i've been that far half a dozen times.	4.7419635893846355
14590. i don't get it why this time i should pull such a stupid trick.	5.874776959314952
14591. well i get it artie said still on the ladder.	7.292593437035646
14592. you	are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting	a record.	7.198778874655976
14593. and you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that	tells you to turn around before you drown yourself.	7.065284708076743
14594. no it wasn't that rob said.	12.141194610871517
14595. a note of awe came	into his voice.	9.943370618057871
14596. when i came up damnit i thought i was going	down.	13.113064913489458
14597. i came up maybe fifty feet before i knew what was happening.	8.30399650492711
14598. pressure-happy artie said and climbed in.	9.670406878971576
14599. i was expecting it sure.	15.154676752241375
14600. but when it happens to you like that i tell you and you're a	hundred feet from where you thought you were- well it makes you think.	7.544243443318636
14601. you don't head back down again.	6.683302774692972
14602. not right away.	19.404323534771276
14603. he had his voice under control again: no one became aware that	he was terrified by what had just happened to him.	6.800656767649487
14604. waddell	the newspaperman was a fellow in his middle forties with a graying crewcut	heavy-framed glasses and a large jaw padded with fat.	6.473927533549529
14605. now he	was going to show how much he knew.	7.693017338695487
14606. our boy didn't chicken out	no sir.	10.877902715767725
14607. he ran into the rapture of the depths.	11.370356956118368
14608. it	makes the diver feel drunk.	10.472119682746735
14609. well that's the only way	to be mrs forsythe said and gave her brassy laugh.	5.922719278911886
14610. maybe not if you're 200 feet under water artie said.	8.944542120903378
14611. it's nothing to fool with.	2.8478925195944758
14612. personally i don't blame him for giving up the dive	much as i regret losing the story.	7.934341762731925
14613. nobody's giving	anything up robinson said.	8.254441635698543
14614. he stood there towering over them	all: gentle mighty determined the moving force in the group; and	yet like a child among adults.	7.881078843313877
14615. you think i got you and artie and	herr schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride?	7.608043591989675
14616.  i'm	going down again.	13.148092146312546
14617. that's my boy! mr forsythe	exclaimed.	4.047684077162469
14618. rob's not going to give up as easy as all that.	10.53980896827979
14619. he was a florid puffy man in his early sixties very natty in his	yachting cap striped jacket and white flannels.	7.433003863098238
14620. he went to key west	every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know	that his title of commodore was never used without irony.	9.616164857930002
14621. old	commodore forsythe who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether	he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without	accidentally turning on something else first.	4.97783426800559
14622. now it did not occur	to him even to wonder whether it was wise for robinson to dive again:	rob was his boy the kid he had rescued from the streets the object	of his pride.	6.882622193620542
14623. why he went on when rob asked me	if he could make his dive on this trip i didn't think twice about	it.	6.313210710322724
14624. i've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around	his brother's tackle shop.	6.162626383295585
14625. hell i gave him the first decent	job he ever had six seven- how many years ago was it rob?	6.7214852174760775
14626. 	seven years ago commodore rob said impassively.	9.060328853487057
14627. he was	thinking big deal: skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven	years and no better off than when i started.	5.913920743006078
14628. excuse me he	said abruptly.	11.568363037656766
14629. he went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters;	went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him.	6.483494550502991
14630. when you gotta go you gotta go mrs forsythe said.	12.237791293612464
14631. waddell muttered something about taking a look around and	climbed up to the flying bridge.	6.1739664784934485
14632. he was disturbed by what had happened	on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the	night before with the german who had come out of the head while he	was fixing himself a drink in the galley.	7.665046722654869
14633. hi there schaffner	he had said.	8.254441635698543
14634. can i make you one?	13.608656069977235
14635.    no thank	you very much schaffner had answered in his accented english.	6.985638126001336
14636. i do not drink so much thank you.	17.690443914586996
14637. waddell had looked the	man over trying to size him up.	6.210871206873012
14638. he was in his early forties rather	short and very compactly built and with a manner that was reserved	and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to american ways.	9.624259216936323
14639. his	open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence until one looked into	his eyes which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence.	5.133937288016895
14640. waddell had heard that he had been a commando in rommel's afrika	corps and he said to himself: i'd hate to run into him in the desert	on a dark night.	8.609942882962333
14641. aloud he had said making conversation:	rob tells me he's using your atlantis equipment on the dive.	5.708822330446606
14642. yes herr schaffner had said.	13.110616200649021
14643. he's one	hell of a decent boy.	4.121739274801433
14644. i agree yes.	22.150701097072105
14645. and if the dive goes ok he has the exclusive import	rights to your line for this country is that right?	7.709966105136711
14646.    well	no herr schaffner said.	11.568363037656766
14647. waddell turned to face him.	8.254441635698543
14648. but that's what he told me.	14.306364280244424
14649. why that's	his main reason for making the dive.	8.257640091759392
14650. shaffner looked at	him altogether without guile and shrugged his shoulders making a	little spreading gesture with his two hands.	6.54093796655646
14651. what do you mean?	25.38840841655893
14652. 	waddell asked frowning.	13.148092146312546
14653. please let me explain	the german said earnestly his face still devoid of deceit.	5.674295354649883
14654. i have	in europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year.	9.57226864005856
14655. now	i wish to enter the american market where the competition is very	strong.	6.539090704817243
14656. i must have a powerful representative here a firm with a national	distribution and ten twenty thousand dollars to advertise my	products.	8.499643267681131
14657. with all respect to a fine young man mr roy is not able	to provide these necessaries.	7.397162344681626
14658. waddell was not an eminently	moral person but he did not like what he had just heard.	9.579293332660491
14659. did you	tell him all this?	10.052594241045202
14660.  he asked.	27.770505909397876
14661. perhaps not in so many	words the german said.	8.338909651164993
14662. but surely you have misunderstood mr	roy.	14.306364280244424
14663. never never did i offer him the exclusive rights.	7.046254127084839
14664. we spoke	of the need for advertising and i agreed that the deep dive would	be most useful for publicity.	8.697380507043706
14665. he was most eager to make the dive;	of course i was willing.	9.377897187588353
14666. but there was no definite agreement about	business arrangements.	25.088352382443635
14667. there	was the end of his front-page feature story with byline.	9.187464534920993
14668. he started	out the door.	17.83289566254582
14669. one moment! herr schaffner said.	11.924666973654702
14670. you	intend to speak with mr roy?	9.670406878971576
14671.    what else?	20.454815948573874
14672. 	waddell asked.	15.594944937291627
14673. if you will pardon i think it would be	better if not.	17.67053923077732
14674. mr roy is determined to make this dive.	10.884681815646449
14675. whatever	you tell him he will dive.	7.622507342753323
14676. i know this from my talks with him.	13.70004351956284
14677. well let's let him make up his own mind ok?	7.614463360917956
14678.  waddell	said.	19.804021762487697
14679. on the basis of the facts.	24.751056326288587
14680. you will make	him unhappy and anxious the german said.	13.746329651109932
14681. at 200 300 400 feet	under the water when he must be paying very much attention he will	be thinking about what you are telling him.	6.020185213560514
14682. it is not good mr	waddell: you will do him great harm.	17.188788245118385
14683. there was no doubt	that herr schaffner meant every word of what he said.	11.737120661447523
14684. waddell came	back from the door and sat on a bunk.	8.347022164056582
14685. i am an honest man	the german said with fervor.	9.838420406259342
14686. i will give mr roy his due for	this dive.	12.43554952822441
14687. i will make him distributor for all of florida- a big	market.	9.307300280990045
14688. all tourists come to florida.	13.821446840433715
14689. this will help him to get out	of his little tackle shop.	8.295068998925062
14690. yes! but there is no use causing him	to worry at this time.	11.215546935495649
14691. the german's words worked on the	newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty.	6.578982329721101
14692. he took a big swig	of his drink.	15.173937016716751
14693. it would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like	this.	12.716391548177393
14694. i think maybe you're right schaffner he said.	15.106277200444472
14695. he	has the distributorship for florida you say?	7.240698345721332
14696.    yes	the german said.	13.148092146312546
14697. at least for south florida.	15.924425970785958
14698. by	god waddell said we don't want to upset the boy at this	time of all times.	6.810878916848748
14699. he sloshed his drink	around and drained it in a few large gulps.	9.000509662736393
14700. the story was shaping up	nicely in his mind: the young pioneer as of old altruistically braving	the unknown; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business	america.	7.226089139442577
14701. join me in another?	11.166302256783883
14702.  he had asked.	29.87980074028303
14703. thank	you the german had said courteously.	7.622507342753323
14704. i do not drink so much.	23.038768309834722
14705. now in that same cabin robinson fell to his knees beside	a bunk.	7.649862945147202
14706. fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions.	8.581436094141479
14707. he pressed	his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers	in a hurried and anxious whisper.	6.905141531060655
14708. blessed saint nicholas	i thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up	instead of down when i was bewildered.	7.20822527435932
14709. and when i make the dive again-	he paused; crossed himself; said a hail mary slowly and	with understanding.	7.0302380919337
14710. folding between his hands the cross that hung	from his neck he took his appeal direct to headquarters.	6.643215071337043
14711. holy mary	mother of god star of the sea stay thou with me on this next	dive.	7.623262324958248
14712. make it come off all right.	12.092157794942215
14713. let me set the record this time	and let me get back ok so the german will give me the exclusive.	6.022569553528683
14714. and make my life different and better from this time on.	9.945938596899774
14715. he crossed himself again and rose.	10.776005861178222
14716. he felt a good deal less	shaky.	22.862657477453176
14717. as he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when	he opened he found artie who came in and sat down on a bunk.	6.713866748107916
14718. artie	had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger.	8.099197770098522
14719. he waited	awhile before he said roy you know your decompression table	don't you?	7.233226891479716
14720.    you know i know it robinson answered	warily.	15.960326094975835
14721. you came straight up from 275 without a stop	artie said.	9.790327128699545
14722. well i was a little bit confused.	17.65433497587547
14723. anyway	i wasn't down long enough to matter.	8.100835098732363
14724. you don't see me stretched	out	on the deck do you?	7.044533946885767
14725.    you know what they say about two	deep dives in one day artie went on still twirling the snorkle and	studying it intently.	7.511988137908959
14726. i don't think you should go down again.	6.068013769591787
14727. early that day matsuo saw a marine.	10.02183161453762
14728. the enemy came looming	around a bend in the trail and matsuo took a hasty shot then fled	without knowing the result ran until breath was a pain in his chest	and his legs were rubbery.	6.36523067683576
14729. as his feet slowed he felt ashamed of the	panic and resolved to make a stand.	7.116336380637427
14730. he crossed the next meadow and	climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed.	8.824820353737188
14731. in the leafiest	part of the tree straddling a broad horizontal limb he could see over	the meadow.	7.659637834852797
14732. for	a while he was content to let events develop in their	good time.	8.381918875480356
14733. he had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column	and while his shot had probably bred indecision they would soon come	hunting.	6.5930686329713515
14734. his superiors had emphasized that marines tortured	others for the sheer pleasure.	8.351818438430747
14735. yesterday; today; tomorrow: no	surrender.	9.118533821976325
14736. his remembering the self-dictate brought no peace- only	a faint chill of doubt.	8.059409733643921
14737. he murmured to himself with firmness: no	surrender.	9.783357976961607
14738. it was best to die fighting the marines.	16.571667076119464
14739. his superiors	had also preached this saying it was the way for eternal honor.	9.142444155252047
14740. what if the marines never came?	17.674983567973815
14741.  his comrades were all dead.	9.627882438407596
14742. then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide.	15.071932802380125
14743. whichever the way he would rot in this vast choking green	his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes.	5.213665170393269
14744. he sighed and leaned	for a moment against the trunk.	10.697093789223626
14745. his fingers touched the bone handle	of a knife.	7.591810951946381
14746. the knife an ammunition pouch and a half-filled bottle	of purified water hung on his belt.	7.860799503526907
14747. besides the belt he wore a loin	cloth.	10.176709428457508
14748. as he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer he saw	a marine in the jungle across the clearing.	8.203157582006407
14749. the	marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed as though	debating whether to brave the sunlight.	7.529595419093242
14750. his fatigues made a streak	of almost phosphorescent green in the mist.	8.351818438430747
14751. come out come	out in the meadow matsuo said under his breath.	6.205448813376699
14752. the man	leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face.	8.649006242526841
14753. a signal?	17.297538600737344
14754. 	matsuo lifted his rifle easing the sling under his left upper arm for	steadiness.	7.54861828735141
14755. fresh on his mind were events of the past day when	his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills.	6.237337540865239
14756. they had fought from	caves and the marines resorted to burning them out.	10.196558294107424
14757. even now like	a ringing in his ears he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting	great orange billows.	6.422047750316987
14758. a wave of flame rippling through their	cave had reached nagamo his friend and with a shriek the man bolted	through the entrance then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet his	uniform blazing.	7.108702411594143
14759. the marines let him advance.	10.915477388587384
14760. when he sank on his knees	they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of	mercy.	9.664907116422295
14761. matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses	both the burned and the unburned the latter decomposing rapidly	under the tropical sun.	4.808070905031883
14762. the callous marines had laughed at each other's	retching while stacking bodies.	9.005093323721033
14763. matsuo repeatedly choked down	his own nausea.	7.622507342753323
14764. at nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside	and into the jungle reeking of death.	9.810617994009197
14765. apprehensively he	peered	to the left to the right into the leafy vine-crisscrossed maze.	7.663118498450285
14766. he decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow with	the one left to distract him.	8.965436278742322
14767. cautious feet	stepping on leafmold; faint creaking of belts and slings; whispers:	he heard none of these.	5.427950274147271
14768. only the hum of insects and the distant	fluttering call of a bird.	10.206074043888313
14769. because he couldn't hear them he was	more convinced they were there.	8.84470119906869
14770. a spectacle occurred across the	meadow: the lone marine took a seat on the ground; leaning sidewise	on a tree trunk he embraced it.	6.731381435890986
14771. while his comrades cocked the trap that one behaved as if it was some	dull maneuver.	7.838217773822263
14772. taking aim at the man's face matsuo squeezed the	trigger up to the point of discharge and then he changed his mind.	9.18493422427484
14773. he wanted the arrogant marine to know fear and so he aimed above the	head.	8.257226076323082
14774. the shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound.	10.582206877639416
14775. like a mischievous boy expecting punishment matsuo	awaited reaction from the jungle.	7.23987864060251
14776. how stupid to give his position	away.	13.273259084777049
14777. the jungle did not retort.	10.915477388587384
14778. the sitter remained seated	hugging the tree.	12.435529358277208
14779. before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy	and insects hummed and birds occasionally called.	6.175939875969864
14780. matsuo puzzled	and grew anxious over the complete passiveness concluding that he	was the butt of a devilish joke.	6.643215071337043
14781. five or so minutes later the	marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight immediately throwing	his hands over his eyes.	5.604946515308204
14782. he went into a whirling dance a sort of	blind chasing of the tail.	10.564100179890085
14783. it ended when he tumbled; but jumping right	up he staggered in no particular direction.	7.456160179316808
14784. he wore no head cover	of any kind and more odd had no visible weapon.	9.248393728318959
14785. with a sudden	decisiveness he lurched in matsuo's direction crossing the meadow	in a zigzagging gallop.	7.214864623179583
14786. when he got closer to the tree matsuo	noted the wild look on his face.	11.030415882910285
14787. the pockets of his jacket bulged.	10.313452422915107
14788. the bobbing head was a poor target so matsuo shot	him in the upper trunk.	8.598486660646406
14789. the marine spun clapping a hand high	on his chest and dived forward.	6.817408452020724
14790. in the hush that followed the echoes	matsuo was tense.	13.277848599464294
14791. they could come on him now without difficulty.	10.179783001517748
14792. gradually he reached a conclusion.	13.99193018399183
14793. the marine was alone for they	were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from	the tree.	5.670580783382225
14794. down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of	foliage.	8.701456009586398
14795. the marine was sprawled some thirty yards away one arm extended.	7.098087065137257
14796. matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out.	8.581436094141479
14797. reflex?	15.610129252044759
14798. 	rifle leveled on the man he made a rush.	9.568768683299782
14799. heat in the sunlight pressed	in like an invisible crowd.	6.617605731239441
14800. he squatted by the head gently	placing the rifle	on the ground.	10.090191208524187
14801. with a snakestrike motion he grasped the	hair and twisting pulled the marine over on his back.	6.752806235637263
14802. the bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone;	around the hole blood glistened in a little patch.	11.41101615416153
14803. maintaining his	clutch on the hair matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in	the jacket pockets.	5.427950274147271
14804. in one: a package of cigarettes and a tinplated	lighter both sticky from the man's bleeding.	8.437918402470649
14805. in the other: a	wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief.	8.621739346247098
14806. one	by one he tossed the objects aside.	9.060328853487057
14807. he didn't smoke and could not light	fires with a flintless lighter; he had no use any longer for exact	time even had the watch been running.	4.834059266667615
14808. then there was no saying how	many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief.	11.295506928239226
14809. too bad the marine had no water.	9.955014462933434
14810. from its holder he took his own canteen.	11.232115946504761
14811. the cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied	pressure.	7.2314973530710995
14812. the marine's eyes opened squeezed shut then opened squinted	in the glare.	9.005093323721033
14813. matsuo put the bottle to his	own lips.	7.14162538120728
14814. the marine reached up a hand.	12.435529358277208
14815. none	for you.	12.292407525564322
14816. the marine blinked soon dropping his hand.	11.387658710676023
14817. not only	had he no canteen but he lacked even the belt to hang one on.	6.264871910774326
14818. you	came well equipped to die.	10.472119682746735
14819. some odor made him lean over	the man.	8.592800318346152
14820. he sniffed and recognized it.	15.385132030882776
14821. so that had been his	difficulty.	14.394114268346533
14822. drunk on sake he must have wandered off from his	bivouac.	7.879513779734377
14823. the marine tried to roll on his right side and moaned.	7.098087065137257
14824. when he rolled on the left side propping on his left elbow matsuo	seized his hair and pulled him back over.	9.970632412664523
14825. awkwardly with one hand matsuo got the cap back on the water	bottle.	6.629184547861966
14826. the smell of sake had freshened yesterday's events in his	thoughts.	10.237882743022842
14827. in the caves with other supplies they had kept cases of	sake.	9.118329211569634
14828. the marine shut his eyes.	13.848082117783294
14829. are you a thrower of	flame marine?	13.023329841216476
14830.  matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and	laid it on the ground out of the marine's reach and away from their	shadows.	8.090775490358395
14831. he waited in his squat gripping the hair.	9.026368296067464
14832. every	so often he turned the knife.	10.528741124775902
14833. its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight.	7.432382072063545
14834. the sun was noon high and matsuo perspired until his body was	dripping.	9.727112601519966
14835. wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an	oily film.	5.825820622377272
14836. the man had thrown the left hand over his eyes.	12.931410350697455
14837. now and	again he murmured something that ended in a giggle.	7.304235152733095
14838. he must have saturated	himself in the drink for the bullet not to shock him out of his	drunken haze.	9.255226308524593
14839. at last he reached	for the knife.	13.68784602134808
14840. even the bone handle scorched and he retrieved	the marine's handkerchief to wrap it.	9.485543797979556
14841. first he barely touched the	blade on the hand which shaded the eyes.	6.743234823714182
14842. the marine yelled and flung	the hand away.	11.387658710676023
14843. with a firm grip on the man's hair matsuo applied the	blade flat on a cheek.	6.967866464620478
14844. a shrill yelp kicked legs and groping hands	that circled matsuo's wrist.	8.729997945191078
14845. matsuo wrenched free and burned the	hands into retreat; burned the other cheek; burned each hand when	they came groping again.	5.083242045036259
14846. the marine commenced to weep and it blighted	the sense of enjoyment.	9.005093323721033
14847. a small measure	of payment marine.	11.850881485859341
14848. he dropped the knife in its scabbard hung the	rifle behind a shoulder.	9.355330106379824
14849. the marine hands on cheeks rolled	by his unwounded side onto his stomach.	6.817408452020724
14850. matsuo	walked toward his tree once glancing back.	9.060328853487057
14851. he would soon die.	18.566342490256332
14852. as matsuo climbed by using the vines	and kicking his feet against the trunk a mood of gloom immersed him like	a jungle shadow.	7.907660488079421
14853. what now?	20.454815948573874
14854.  in the jungle birds were mute while	insects preserved only the monotony of living.	11.579515991789682
14855. it was the marine: head lifted he strained and called.	12.589369744984248
14856. then he	astonished matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat.	8.887534383548
14857. he	cupped his mouth and yelled.	8.254441635698543
14858. matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder.	9.060328853487057
14859. once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die.	10.05671475102934
14860. it sounded as if the man were calling him: hey	japanese h hey there japanese.	10.460580290970686
14861. the man tilted back his	head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container.	7.614481754119883
14862. he	performed the act twice more and the begging in his tone grew more distinct.	7.032105024464237
14863. the marine nodded	vigorously.	14.843753820270253
14864. matsuo laughed slung the rifle.	10.472119682746735
14865. the marine	was a winehead.	12.486750257698887
14866. his superiors had said that all marines were depraved.	9.117594365094579
14867. the marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before	an idol.	6.817408452020724
14868. remembering his own thirst matsuo took out his water bottle.	8.04011880641638
14869. one swallow was all he would have; he was very thirsty but he must	observe water discipline.	6.478243228342696
14870. his years of campaigning had taught him	the value of water discipline.	8.351818438430747
14871. he began to uncap the bottle	the rusty cap squealing on its threads.	9.577286834087094
14872. popping upright the marine waved	both hands and shouted.	8.581436094141479
14873. of course it was water he really	craved; down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out.	8.199228077127175
14874. the	marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack.	7.198778874655976
14875. he had no water for an enemy.	13.630485904552046
14876. and when this was	gone he hadn't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water	if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool.	8.50597064390485
14877. he capped the	bottle and replaced it.	10.776005861178222
14878. after all he had less reason to desire it	than the marine.	10.6349839564744
14879. before much longer the marine quieted down.	8.925661427981641
14880. the upper part of his packet had stained dark.	11.442408026034707
14881. there is nothing for you matsuo said.	20.382054071433625
14882. your superiors	will certainly beat you for your desertion besides the dishonor of it.	7.688767207573999
14883. from the convulsive quivers of	the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping.	6.890163238277723
14884. he reminded	matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in china.	9.592132658614503
14885. in china	it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform smudged blood-specked	with the village burning about him and shells exploding.	6.16896772393698
14886. chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables	as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and	walked towards the bar.	6.157942065974489
14887. only blue throat and his gang stayed where	they were.	7.796565768573885
14888. blue throat was slumped with his back against the bar elbows	supporting his massive frame.	7.569955194572432
14889. he leered at the stranger as the	distance between them closed.	7.953394054598466
14890. since when did they allow beardless	kids into the saloon bars of this town boys?	8.021446736096705
14891.  he asked.	21.889553134177078
14892. seems	to me i don't remember altering any law about that.	7.879513779734377
14893. he straightened up alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer.	7.560809233574742
14894. stay	right here where you are kid he called.	8.581436094141479
14895. i don't aim	to have minors breathing down my neck when i'm a-drinking:	the stranger ignored him.	4.577750341683835
14896. he didn't stop till he was within three	feet of blue throat and by that time the gang leader's right	hand was on the butt of his revolver.	6.2827207156421
14897. i'm billy tilghman	said the stranger and i've come for pat conyers' body.	3.9129367137318405
14898. and what makes you think you're going to get it pretty	boy?	13.58049589604503
14899.    because i'm asking.	17.686823855040707
14900. most of the time i get	what i ask for.	19.612829158150433
14901. blue throat winked at his six cronies.	8.057006762835188
14902. the kid has no manners boys.	13.247513868353657
14903. shall we teach him some?	8.581771986667057
14904.  his	gun was half drawn when he asked the question but the weapon never	left its holster.	7.558827313059943
14905. tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific	right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin.	6.359182024021638
14906. his	head snapped round and he reeled back crashing into the table where	his buddies were sprawling.	6.886249538313906
14907. tilghman leapt on to him dragged	him upright and hit him again this time sending him careening against	the bar.	5.725678552867678
14908. a bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from tilghman's	stomach as blue throat's henchmen started shooting.	7.324251899623047
14909. tilghman	flung himself aside dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun.	5.825820622377272
14910. the colt roared twice and two men dropped writhing.	10.189497018560665
14911. a third shot	doused the light.	12.090487443242834
14912. somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled	you all right billy?	12.586177337090724
14913.    yes george but i ain't	got poor old pat's body yet.	7.176091908258277
14914. and i aim to have it.	16.45213367170813
14915. he fired	again and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed.	9.29010416405802
14916. another took off	his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor.	7.91683904020529
14917. and me said another blue throat	henchman.	10.242612813271945
14918. tilghman and his partner	george rust herded the men into a corner.	8.020585206635284
14919. and now said tilghman	with deadly calm i'll repeat what i said.	8.184836512003358
14920. i've come	for pat conyers' body.	6.1280579316837445
14921. in two minutes the body of tilghman's	former comrade who had been killed by blue throat in a gambling	brawl the previous night was carried into the town's funeral	parlor to be prepared for decent burial.	6.266442249889693
14922. blue throat nursing an aching	jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride rode out of town with the	survivors of the fight.	0.0
14923. that critter will be back tomorrow	predicted george rust and he'll bring fifty of his kind	back with him.	6.083863602767401
14924. blue throat won't stand for this.	11.042288164230637
14925. he'll shoot up	the town.	5.5447349469503715
14926. the reverend james	doran had scarcely completed pat conyers' last rites on boot	hill in the township of petrie when shots were heard in the distance.	6.673055462121845
14927. amen said the reverend doran grabbing his rifle propped	up against a tombstone and now my brethren it would seem that	our presence is required elsewhere.	5.537149596889579
14928. billy tilghman and	his comrades rode off to the battle.	8.96744955125262
14929. blue throat who had ruled the	town with his six-shooter for the last six months certainly had no intention	of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship.	5.663661911119409
14930. it was essential	that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring	ruthless gun-slinger and this was the time-honored wild west method	of doing it.	10.187839802752045
14931. he rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and	liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance	to main street.	7.029075686511913
14932. the entire length of the street could be raked with	rifle fire from this barn.	10.386149832200534
14933. any posse riding down the street to demand	blue throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst	of fire.	5.605246340079154
14934. the law-abiding citizens of petrie had gathered	inside kaster's store halfway down the street.	8.795489207719381
14935. several were firing	into the barn when billy tilghman arrived.	7.369806103838146
14936. he sized up the situation	and shook his head.	11.45143587764551
14937. if blue throat has his way he'll	keep us all cooped up in here for days he said.	6.361504338808083
14938. there's only	one thing to move him fast and we have it right here in this very	store.	6.470319531562674
14939. he called the store owner and together they went into	the stockroom.	9.363645342566025
14940. billy returned with six sticks of dynamite.	9.257579916818113
14941. i'm	gonna drop these into blue throat's lap he announced and	i'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while i get near	enough to toss 'em through the window.	4.625142923266387
14942. he slipped outside	hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways.	10.17321954538198
14943. blue throat's	men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts	and board walk as he passed.	5.476227300068587
14944. fifty yards away from the barn	he dodged inside a barber's shop and came out at the back.	8.548951184896485
14945. here he	couldn't be seen by blue throat and his gang.	7.83084991148359
14946. all he had to do	was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks run to within ten yards of	an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through.	7.3803001492617115
14947. billy	tilghman did just that.	9.118533821976325
14948. within seconds the big barn was blasted into	smoking splinters with every outlaw either dead or injured inside.	7.487245974942759
14949. it was the abrupt end of blue throat's dictatorship in petrie.	11.607080677954103
14950. though	only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to	those parts.	7.615092762846159
14951. to tilghman the incident was just one of a long	list of hair-raising smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the	law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old and did	not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning	a drunk to be quiet.	6.575609048338041
14952. of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys	of the old west uncle billy tilghman stands out head and	shoulders.	9.739876756748536
14953. he was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any	other famous gun-slinging character in the book.	8.222778856087528
14954. he saw the most action	beat up more badmen with his bare fists broke up the most gangs and	sent more murderers to the gallows than any other us marshal	who lived before or after him.	7.315744687435005
14955. for fifty years his guns and	ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the	enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the west.	6.04989846034221
14956. the deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified	almost to the point of hero-worship but because billy tilghman remained	strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career	his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the	west have remained almost unsung.	8.227527729299513
14957. citizens took the view that	a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway	but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of	half a century.	6.328568125354909
14958. he came within an ace of being riddled with bullets	during his long fight with the doolin gang which terrorized oklahoma	in the 1890's.	7.620871024249789
14959. led by bill doolin these mobsters specialized	in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed	banks making liberal use of their guns.	5.12030472536185
14960. bill doolin's ambition	it appeared was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of	jesse james and billy the kid and bill tilghman had sworn he would	stop him.	6.128333467439386
14961. tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove	with the doolin gang.	6.210871206873012
14962. they bought rustled cattle from the outlaw	kept him supplied with guns and ammunition harbored his men in their	houses.	7.517449521566685
14963. billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers	named ed dunn who lived at rock fort.	6.03972165712838
14964. on a bitterly	cold day in january 1895 accompanied only by neal brown as his	deputy tilghman left the township of guthrie and headed for rock fort	and dunn's ranch.	7.050482271040697
14965. it was snowing hard when they got there and	they saw no horses outside.	9.029371249431378
14966. the only evidence of occupation came from	the chimney which was belching out thick smoke.	9.272601147037847
14967. the two lawmen	halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door.	7.7845503316947395
14968. wait here	neal said tilghman.	11.568363037656766
14969. if i don't come out within half an	hour ride back to town and bring out a posse.	7.145171492989194
14970. leaving his rifle	in the wagon tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it.	8.665208769702062
14971. there was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside.	9.29050855026414
14972. directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire a welcome sight	on that bitterly cold day.	7.782071459972845
14973. seated near it with his back to the door	was the rancher ed dunn.	6.360513988104634
14974. the rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didn't move.	11.154959614415695
14975. tilghman	closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire.	6.210871206873012
14976. suddenly	he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch	and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck.	7.625227735444233
14977. along each side	of the room were six tiered bunks each one screened off with a curtain.	6.4253231526000425
14978. and projecting wickedly through these curtains were the	gleaming muzzles of six rifles all trained on billy tilghman.	7.646799373994232
14979. the	fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs	might slam into his hide.	6.110212192912578
14980. thinking fast tilghman never	hesitated for one instant.	9.060328853487057
14981. he walked right up to the fire as though blissfully	unaware of the guns covering him.	7.499740511925058
14982. the men behind them were	bill doolin and five of his gang- every man a killer.	9.108937667396317
14983. cold	day said tilghman placing his hands behind him and casually	presenting his backside to the fire.	5.427950274147271
14984. just dropped in to ask where	jed hawkins lives.	10.673957607741787
14985. can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow.	6.723353094824249
14986. he wouldn't look tilghman in	the face.	13.671139498061125
14987. follow the river for five miles he said hoarsely.	7.714558013121567
14988. jed's	homestead is on the south bank.	13.071563599020674
14989. resisting the overwhelming	temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap	tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation	for a good ten minutes.	5.2405042068428145
14990. all that time rifle barrels were pointing	unwaveringly at his head and body.	9.663987507092408
14991. one false move on his part and	he would be a dead man.	7.955324069993227
14992. well he announced guess i'll	be going now ed and thanks for the warmup.	8.216429064128185
14993. he strolled back	to the door whistling softly hands still clasped behind him.	7.233226891479716
14994. he	left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace	and wondered by what remarkable stroke of providence he had been	allowed to come out alive.	6.558724199639135
14995. but he knew well enough that those	guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon.	7.744482213806159
14996. if he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his	deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly.	8.80851681446919
14997. leisurely	he climbed on to the wagon next to neal brown.	7.134394864871173
14998. don't say or	do anything he said softly.	4.270701532995561
14999. just get out of here without it looking	as though we're in a hurry.	7.692534990684838
15000. that place is crawling with bill	doolin and his gang.	10.44343699232173
15001. even as he spoke those words billy	tilghman's life hung on a thread.	6.979306954805334
15002. back in the house a hoodlum named	red buck sore because billy had been allowed to leave unscathed	jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right	then.	8.084614369160196
15003. you'll stay right here commanded bill doolin	covering red with his rifle.	3.9028842679252227
15004. billy tilghman is too good a man	to shoot in the back.	7.736320221757741
15005. but the fighting	marshal's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a	full and final stop one night in a street at cromwell oklahoma where	he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets.	5.514861498803838
15006. wiley lynn a self-styled prohibition officer had hit town the previous	day and had been drinking ever since.	6.871061340911338
15007. that night he reeled out	of ma murphy's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting	off his revolver.	5.829399153946358
15008. for several months now jack carter a big overgrown boy of fifteen	with a fuzzy pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot	of red in them had been haunted by a dream a vision of a woman.	6.314851529099284
15009. this	woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face but she	radiated warmth a sweet warmth; she would talk to him in a soothing	voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put	her hands on him and kiss him passionately.	4.949100537229873
15010. when she would do these	things he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach.	8.653419423517734
15011. then he would run to the toilet behind the house.	8.976521242088117
15012. sometimes he	did this three or four times a day for this woman was almost always	with him.	9.247662768970907
15013. he would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother	and father knew- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell	it on him.	6.373150289107815
15014. but they never said anything so he figured it was all right.	11.386566651625744
15015. and so when miss langford came to teach at the one-room	chestnut school where jack was a pupil in the eighth grade the woman	of jack's mind assumed the teacher's face and figure.	5.438528183665922
15016. he could	not keep his eyes off her when at school; when he went home at	night he took her with him in his mind and she did the things the anonymous	woman used to do and he did the thing afterwards each time as	he used to do.	6.591712068659504
15017. when he awoke in the mornings she was in his mind and	he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh.	7.768261153313286
15018. miss langford was an attractive	girl.	12.406760308875619
15019. tall blonde blue-eyes fair buxom without being heavy she cut	a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils	in her fresh starched summer dress.	4.726707772215755
15020. something was beginning to stir	and come alive in her too	she was twenty now; but if it had been it had been smothered until	: you could tell it by the way she watched the older	bigger boys like jack.	8.541900446953399
15021. she would look at jack with that hidden	something in her eyes and jack would see the woman and become breathless	and a little sick.	5.752400670651995
15022. school began in august the hottest	part of the year and for the first few days miss langford was very	lenient with the children letting them play a lot and the new ones sort	of get acquainted with one another.	8.451739055524992
15023. the first two or three days they	went home early.	12.43291648505809
15024. all that is except jack.	19.822677471564386
15025. he hung around	the schoolhouse watching through a window from outside while miss	langford straightened desks and put the room in order.	5.796303623730875
15026. once	she kneeled down to pick up some books	where they'd dropped on the floor and jack looked up her dress-	at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg.	7.64488662186851
15027. he thought for a moment	his heart had stopped beating.	8.431773034471274
15028. about that time miss langford straightened	up and looked out the window directly at him he thought although	probably she didn't even see him.	7.541119333195127
15029. he jumped back ducked and ran	crouching down the hill away from the school.	8.18390742933666
15030. he didn't	look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and	out of breath; then he slowed to a walk.	0.0
15031. the vision became even stronger	now.	12.155081426749899
15032. i'll get her yet	he muttered to himself.	5.994717221457542
15033. i've got to get her.	5.379633490098874
15034. that night he dreamed	a dream violent with passion in which he and the woman now the	teacher did everything except engage in the act	and when he	awoke the next morning his heart was afire.	7.241091345847519
15035. he ate litle that	morning and his mother became concerned inasmuch as he usually ate	heartily.	6.718491433348979
15036. what's the matter honey?	8.695597929211152
15037.  she said with the	solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child.	7.905131466207428
15038. aren't	you hungry?	15.594944937291627
15039.    no i'm not hungry he said pushing	back the bacon and eggs.	7.662022395705422
15040. outside it was already hot at 7:30 am	and it was getting hot in the kitchen.	7.997763580351284
15041. he felt a little sick at	his stomach.	13.040630959432214
15042. are you sick?	28.260706101627743
15043.    no he said.	15.481894110527692
15044. i guess it's this hot weather.	13.93195501835056
15045. don't you play hard today then.	3.3326417997438393
15046. and if you get sick ask the teacher	to let you come home early.	11.811005462688012
15047. daddy left the car for me and i'm	going to town this afternoon.	6.143033877028681
15048. o k i won't	play hard he promised.	14.844619737110612
15049. just then charles lever yelled hey	jack from the quarry road which ran behind the carter house	and jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen	door yelling good-bye mom over his shoulder.	5.011549063282701
15050. whaddya	say boy?	15.594944937291627
15051.  charles said grinning showing his huge yellow	teeth.	7.907709358913829
15052. charles also fifteen was tall and skinny scraggly with	straight black hair like an indian's and sharp brown eyes.	6.88282689621633
15053. he considered	himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him.	6.955990454870539
15054. you know what i done last night?	19.830260702660954
15055.  charles said as	they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away	from the dixie highway through a corn field and a patch of woods to	the school.	5.223224198812374
15056. jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded	would involve a girl and probably be dirty because girls were charles'	only apparent interest.	7.158180121519901
15057. but jack always derived vicarious sensual	thrills from charles' revelations	so he usually invited them as he	did now.	6.478669021782826
15058. what?	19.804021762487697
15059.    i got margaret rider in one	of them old box cars down there by the quarry.	6.5779768796623195
15060. a nude imaginary	picture of miss langford flashed across jack's mind.	9.12172255696927
15061. hell you say?	10.363724110347151
15062.  he said lapsing into the profanity	he often used when away from his parents and especially when he	was with charles.	8.956442715376758
15063. how'd you do it?	9.118533821976325
15064.    hell i jist	got on top of-   no i mean how'd you get her to	do it?	6.886249538313906
15065.    hell i jist ask her.	8.254441635698543
15066. jist like	that?	15.594944937291627
15067.    hell yes.	12.292407525564322
15068. she's been hangin' around me	a lot here lately and i figgered i might as well's try it.	5.526271227185282
15069. besides	i heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin' it.	6.547671080113237
15070. it's all over branchville.	3.1476988058506823
15071. if you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even	get her your ownself.	7.36288778974062
15072. i might try it one of these days	jack said wonderingly thinking of miss langford.	9.362729980047444
15073. when	they reached the school a gang of boys and girls were already	there playing crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse.	6.439393716517986
15074. miss	langford in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals without	socks was out there with them trying to get them inside.	7.251401031437689
15075. time	for books she yelled jingling a little five-and-dime store	bell in her right hand.	5.674295354649883
15076. oh come	on miss langford play with us just onct one of the little girls	begged smiling wistfully.	8.843443540578656
15077. no not now said the teacher.	9.570057002710861
15078. come inside now.	14.11939494765156
15079. the children	grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse.	7.43304005989246
15080. jack watched miss langford all morning.	9.840259200908385
15081. he could think of nothing	else save his mental image of her nude figure and what charles	had said that morning about margaret rider.	6.273313491403522
15082. occasionally he would	look across the aisle at margaret fourteen and demure in a fresh green	organdy dress sitting in the sixth-grade row and he coud hardly believe	she would do what charles had said she did.	5.877619549502566
15083. at noontime	remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the	kids jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys	except charles went off out the road to play ball.	5.880013685705087
15084. why ain't	you playin' ball?	15.604009980076775
15085.  he asked charles suspiciously as they sat	in the well-house shade watching the girls congregate in front of the	schoolhouse.	7.512811727235525
15086. miss langford come out and play with us like you	promised several of the little girls called.	9.068333863445131
15087. i'd druther	stay here and watch the girls charles grinned.	5.131232046003695
15088. maybe some	of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress.	8.258104263628434
15089. maybe	jack said idly watching for miss langford.	7.14162538120728
15090. presently	she came out of the schoolhouse.	16.184694872818184
15091. when she appeared two or three	of the little girls jumped up and down yelling goody goody.	7.781972615348898
15092. let's play with 'em jack said rising from where	he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants.	7.167815421236536
15093. ok	charles rose also and the two of them moved over to join	the girls.	7.539446827326729
15094. they played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap.	11.638832432999648
15095. then when miss langford was on the end of the line of girls	jack in the middle of the line gave an extra hard pull and the young	teacher sprawled backwards sitting down hard her dress flying over	her head.	7.985163753263297
15096. while she was struggling to get her skirt down and get	on her feet again jack ran over offered her his hand and said gosh	i'm sorry miss langford.	6.575890744956258
15097. i didn't mean to pull so hard.	6.958609338716115
15098. that's all right she said tossing her head back	to get the hair out of her eyes.	4.903700437570849
15099. with one hand	she held her skirt down while she took jack's extended hand with	the other.	6.786977190402116
15100. when her hand touched his fire went through jack and he	felt weak but he managed somehow to get her on her feet.	7.454575054175027
15101. he thought	she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand	go.	6.174920939052518
15102. thank you she said dusting herself off.	17.222252730531803
15103. will you play with us again miss langford?	8.601123064503946
15104.  one of the little	girls said.	33.17394344668567
15105. maybe some other day.	11.383550228188565
15106. oh shucks the girl said.	12.392495127773664
15107. i don't believe i'll	play any more neither.	4.98029565410453
15108. me neither others said and soon	the game broke up the children going off in pairs in larger groups	and alone.	6.975893708710233
15109. jack walked off alone out the road in the searing	midday sun past robert allen's three-room tarpapered house toward	the field where the other boys were playing ball thinking of what	he would do in order to make miss langford have him stay in after	school- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw	the look in her eyes.	4.748397333568927
15110. when he came back to the schoolhouse	his mind was made up.	15.909501803956017
15111. he simply would not work his arithmetic problems	when the teacher held his class.	7.5469986271841245
15112. that should do it he thought because	miss langford had said she was going to be strict about school	work.	9.854224198467959
15113. he had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone	or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him but he	couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities: the teacher	probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay	in after school.	5.8216996220604
15114. the only drawback now to the plan he'd	decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work too and the	teacher would have that person stay late along with jack.	6.892999744092849
15115. but	i've got to take a chance on it he told himself desperately.	6.798643165664191
15116. to his surprise his plan worked perfectly.	12.260910477542323
15117. all right if you	can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school	it out miss langford said firmly not smiling.	6.113244169169874
15118. you will	stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and	work your problems.	9.573081630252256
15119. and so when the others stampeded out that	afternoon	jack remained docilely in his seat near a window looking out in	what he hoped was a pitiable manner while the other kids laughed and	yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed going home.	5.082239187769384
15120. his heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was	trying to think his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened	child how will i do it?	6.072831377733698
15121. 	on the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a	young woman of remarkable beauty and poise.	5.15576524365156
15122. she munched little ginger	cakes called mulatto's belly and kept her green somewhat hypnotic	eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot	king snake wrapped around his bronze neck.	6.404739022628905
15123. the youth with	the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman.	7.305739819040598
15124. lithe and muscular he had well-molded features and his light	color told of the european ancestors who had been intimate with the slave	women of his family.	6.836376672070171
15125. the haughty white girl turned to a distinguished	hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured: look	at your watch col garvier.	5.571976520698639
15126. it is almost time for and calinda	to begin.	20.064985204721587
15127. col henri garvier was one of new orleans'	most important and enlightened slave owners.	7.271890803907004
15128. he chuckled and gave	the signal for the dance to start.	10.798608636258047
15129. the slaves ran gaily to the center	of congo square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called johnny	no-name.	6.250604533565303
15130. johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer	bones against the gourd which served as his drum.	7.410366695525521
15131. he showed his gleaming	tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently his brass earrings jangling	discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy.	6.039305955272235
15132. the	drummer	flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda	a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners	and their disciples in the louisiana slave compounds.	6.092727771140672
15133. the	dance was of haitian origin.	8.254441635698543
15134. the white girl with the penetrating	green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of	about 30 who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows.	7.003958136281758
15135. he was possessive	in his manner and though a slave obviously was educated after a	fashion and imitated the manners of his owners.	6.244951219500418
15136. he proudly wore the	blue livery of her house for the girl was madame delphine lalaurie	wife of the prominent surgeon dr louis lalaurie who bore one	of the south's oldest and most cherished names.	6.577766720148524
15137. delphine was	a pace-setter in high society.	7.622507342753323
15138. she was a top horsewoman and one of	the city's most gracious hostesses.	10.853354302114617
15139. although new orleans was not	to learn of it for a spell she also was a sadist a nymphomaniac and	unobtrusively mad- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against	humanity ever committed on american soil.	6.6169240860803535
15140. madame lalaurie	gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was	stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders.	6.720596405949159
15141. the slender handsome fellow was called dandy brandon by	the other slaves.	7.098087065137257
15142. he was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure	for women of any race.	9.688906735989212
15143. but dandy had had little experience with	girls on his master's plantation in bayou st john.	6.670433134891451
15144. shy	actually he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant	of the girls' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in	the open fields in carriages and in boathouses.	6.083302797349597
15145. this young slave	was therefore quite unprepared when delphine lalaurie signaled	that she wanted him to draw near.	6.137472201451243
15146. the woman eyed the youth with the	avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is	not yet in his collection.	6.852952259467768
15147. what is your name boy?	15.963047626140778
15148.  come	a bit closer.	13.148092146312546
15149. i won't bite you know.	9.291145906367928
15150. he gaped at madame	lalaurie and sniffed the paris perfume which emanated from her.	8.824820353737188
15151. my name is dandy brandon missy.	10.43564356904987
15152. i belong	to master alexander prieur.	15.711603260075847
15153. she said with intense feeling:	come near let me feel your arms.	8.312221158602966
15154. you look quite strong and	healthy to me dandy.	12.37182052821836
15155. mrs lalaurie impatiently propelled	the slave toward her waiting carriage.	7.236036544386507
15156. lifting her skirts she climbed	in never relinquishing her grip on his arm.	7.391013650626644
15157. the woman seemed utterly	unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor.	7.36782837600986
15158. once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau she drew the curtains	and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination	usually reserved for army inductees.	7.900341865622517
15159. satisfied at last and	after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced delphine that	dandy was capable of learning new arts she opened the window and called	to her liveried driver.	4.595688357851942
15160. this was the big man with the proprietory	air and the beetling shaggy eyebrows.	12.146873365425813
15161. aristide! i	want you	to find monsieur prieur at once and give him this money for the	boy's purchase.	5.863835160866735
15162. there's $600 in gold in this chamois sack.	5.603364996017602
15163. if the	old fool argues about the price tell him i shall order my husband	not to treat him as a patient any longer.	6.209097011519293
15164. prieur has gout and depends	on louis' pills and bleedings.	8.196044167676531
15165. besides he owns 300 slaves.	10.227172228118718
15166. one	less shouldn't matter to him.	10.472119682746735
15167. aristide devol the sardonic	manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native	sierra leone smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver	hat.	5.298041156867853
15168. his bold eyes raked the woman and a perceptive spectator might	sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to	owner.	8.011963758097826
15169. another youth madame?	12.126610009385061
15170.  the coachman said softly.	15.841500723885778
15171. this one is a tender chicken oui?	10.203105184398687
15172.  such delicate beauty	such fine flesh.	13.462398235847678
15173. it will rip and shred easily for madame.	13.19424916211483
15174. be quiet devol! you are forgetting your place.	12.051520930542804
15175. the	tall coachman walked off briskly in search of alexander prieur.	7.067437401480571
15176. delphine	lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove dandy	brandon- cowering in the back seat of the carriage- to her mansion	at 677 perdido street.	7.037754833650717
15177. dr louis lalaurie stood on the	veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached	the pillared mansion.	6.858278451047273
15178. dandy curiosity overcoming his apprehensions	peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle.	7.687455796095871
15179. he	saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large	head.	6.256539229583498
15180. dr lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket and his myopic	eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses.	7.080704255950575
15181. he was	about 50 years old.	12.127026643485452
15182. another young man my dear?	11.833068316496098
15183.  really	you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself he said frowning	with displeasure.	5.674295354649883
15184. delphine presented her cheek for a kiss	and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster.	6.886249538313906
15185. dandy is	to be our house guest louis.	7.14162538120728
15186. i want the room in the attic prepared	for him he is a most unusual lad quite precocious in many ways.	9.052839371640973
15187. he	deserves a better life than just rotting away on the prieur plantation.	5.825820622377272
15188. his room will be ready shortly.	11.107172507795411
15189. the physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory	glance at the cringing slave.	6.196120048044738
15190. had dandy been older or wiser instinct	might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the	lalauries' tender care if he valued his life.	7.679529188885832
15191. but he liked	the smell of delphine's perfume.	13.039175579197503
15192. besides her endearments and caresses	in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple	youth.	7.245550930354858
15193. also he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony.	7.1609225413820665
15194. so dandy brandon trustingly entered the house with delphine	lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to	be his new home.	6.904657390751475
15195. airless and dingy though it was the attic represented	luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and	sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at bayou st john.	4.934586778206286
15196. he bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted	when madame lalaurie- after closing the door- showed the	slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber.	6.7913688424134175
15197. it was just as well that the ignorant dandy enjoyed himself to the	hilt that first evening for the room was to become his prison cell.	6.499798237051677
15198. when he finally left the sinister mansion on perdido street he was	carried out in a coroner's basket.	9.286188248670014
15199. just six weeks after	dandy brandon's arrival at the mansion the little surgeon and	his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball to which	only new orleans' oldest and wealthiest families were invited.	4.849103268888988
15200. a stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms and delphine	circulated graciously among her guests chatting airily of the	forthcoming races the latest fashions from paris and louisiana	politics.	6.514253597117472
15201. suddenly there was a commotion upstairs a despairing	boyish shriek and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians	and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase.	5.380423015927094
15202. it was dandy brandon clad only in a bloody loincloth	emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him.	9.603765766861356
15203. the	lad's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts.	6.002446559592496
15204. his pinched	face showed the ravages of malnutrition.	10.276228481933904
15205. feebly he pointed an	accusing finger at madame lalaurie and shouted: evil woman!	you did this h you like to hurt h to beat people h i want h	to go home.	4.930970328037867
15206. these were the last words he ever uttered.	11.25654705337184
15207. convulsively	he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of senator	gaston berche crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician	wore.	4.958070100322966
15208. dr louis lalaurie examined the inert form of	the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead.	7.080704255950575
15209. the ball	broke up in confusion.	10.915477388587384
15210. guests stared with horror at madame lalaurie	and made speedy departures.	9.141255484523787
15211. delphine stood like stone	her eyes alive	with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse.	6.385559017313622
15212. but at	the coroner's inquest delphine told a forthright story.	11.077418040299065
15213. i	saw the boy dandy at the congo square festivities and felt sorry	for him.	5.674295354649883
15214. it was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom	when the right time came for he was a bright and friendly youth who	seemed worthy of our interest.	9.043405388737602
15215. after i paid monsieur prieur for	dandy i brought him home but he was ill at ease and ran away the	same night.	6.250901109818043
15216. how he returned in such a ghastly condition or why i	cannot say.	10.190837273811967
15217. dr lalaurie and i didn't even know he was in the	house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs.	6.494771896509721
15218. she daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said	with obvious emotion: that poor boy! he must have fallen in	with evil companions for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and	inexperienced.	6.9383374042820005
15219. ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing	him back to our house to die.	5.702403933400962
15220. such a pitiful end!   though	the slave's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner's	panel dandy's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury	and disregarded.	7.009102645711785
15221. the lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder	and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the veracity	of so illustrious a lady.	6.379406920481646
15222. moreover runaway slaves frequently got into	serious trouble in new orleans' dives.	8.958820932031152
15223. so the verict was	death at the hands of a person or persons unknown and the elite	of the city accepting delphine's testimony welcomed her and the	doctor back into the fold.	6.434895136297564
15224. once again life went its serene way- soirees	fox hunts balls and dinners.	9.68385099384614
15225. the excitement over brandon's	bizarre death abated and madame lalaurie's stock soared when	she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing	cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital.	5.213184650104667
15226. then	on july 2 there occurred another incident which set tongues to	wagging at a furious clip.	6.886249538313906
15227. mrs victor dominique socially	prominent and a neighbor of the lalauries chanced to glance out of	her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight.	4.964751790606637
15228. the	manservant devol and his mistress delphine lalaurie were pursuing	a young girl- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty- across the front	lawn of the lalaurie mansion.	6.157942065974489
15229. the girl was not more than 16.	11.058703384484538
15230. she	was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not	conceal the knife slashes on her back.	6.406051459100846
15231. the bleeding girl was	tiring fast; the coachman and delphine were gaining on her as she raced	down perdido street.	5.993450458891224
15232. the fugitive cried out in an oddly	sibilant voice: help me somebody! they have pulled out all	my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw!	bastards he would say all i did was put a beat to that vivaldi	stuff and the first chair clobbered me! since then and	since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent- and	even indecent- group from greenwich village to the embarcadero	he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper.	5.527476869293807
15233. there ain't	nothin' faster or lonelier or more direct than a cannonball	freight	when you wanna go someplace feathertop would say.	6.707677868713437
15234. the accommodations	may not be the poshest but man! there ain't nobody	askin' for your	ticket stub neither.	8.24745396509008
15235. he had been conning	the freights for a long long time now.	12.735613226322648
15236. ever since the hooch and the	trouble with the quartet and midge and the child.	9.087608396798782
15237. it had been a very long time that had no form and no end.	11.255193688391527
15238. he was- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer	his own- riding the dark train out.	8.636477419660896
15239. out and out and never to return	again.	10.960289587497991
15240. till one day the last freight had been jumped the last pint	had been killed the last beat had been rapped.	6.833205048662855
15241. that was the day it	ended.	17.90220511512627
15242. the freight car was cold early in the morning.	11.960018879653097
15243. he was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks	the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering	the sound of his ocarina.	6.969661158392085
15244. he held his elbows away from his	body and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled	its tune-belly.	7.4490345241416716
15245. the train slowed at a road crossing and	the big door slid open; at first gratingly caught by grains of corn-	then with a clash into its slot.	5.1400253740636375
15246. the boy lifted the girl	by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor.	9.212236460535312
15247. she pulled her legs	up under her to rise her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs and	feathertop's music pffft-ed away.	5.615769584361092
15248. now that is a very nice	a very nice he murmured to himself back in his corner.	9.874872220378494
15249. a	little thing but the right twist for the action that counted.	6.803118015135792
15250. hot	that was the word hot! hair like a morning-frightened sparrow's	wings with the sun shining down over them.	7.096559300248802
15251. a poet yet! his thoughts	for the swanlike neck the full high breasts the slim waist and	the long legs were less than poetic however.	5.23666488506328
15252. zingggg-o!	then the boy straight-armed himself up twisting at the last	moment so he landed sitting.	7.032105024464237
15253. he was less to see but feathertop	took him in too just to keep the records straight.	7.749694603130245
15254. curly	hair high cheekbones wide gnomelike mouth a pair of drummer's	blocky hands and a body that said well maybe i can wrestle you for	ten minutes- but then i'm finished.	6.251265365724708
15255. we made it cappy	the chick said.	10.717432709549398
15256. yeah seems so don't it the boy	laughed hugging her close.	7.879513779734377
15257. ah-ah! feathertop interrupted	standing up brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants.	5.825820622377272
15258. we run a respectable house here.	14.195342816968028
15259. they whirled	and saw him standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded	freight wall.	6.376876511860498
15260. he was big and filthy and his toes stuck out of	the flapping tops of his shoes.	9.016975878454005
15261. he held the black plastic kazoo lightly.	9.783357976961607
15262. come sit said feathertop motioning them toward	him.	9.480724918833243
15263. that crap is softer over here.	10.445007602079077
15264. the girl smiled and	started forward.	13.848082117783294
15265. the boy yanked her back hard tugging her off her	feet and gathered her into the crook of his arm.	5.876737685208168
15266. now stay	with me kitty he snapped irritably.	11.137103222084646
15267. i vowed to take care of	you- and that's what i'm gonna do.	7.778213687239533
15268. we don't know this guy.	8.849086346254767
15269. oooo square bit feathertop screwed his face up.	6.764147616291221
15270. this	guy was strictly from outsville.	10.472119682746735
15271. but nowhere!   what	is with this vow jazz?	10.19575443707157
15272.  feathertop inquired lounging against	the freight's vibrating wall.	9.060328853487057
15273. we- we eloped cappy	said.	9.118533821976325
15274. his head came up and he said it defiantly.	14.496279608868273
15275. feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand.	6.764147616291221
15276. these two were going to be easy pickins.	15.960502982237067
15277. they couldn't have much	dough but then none of the freight-bums feathertop rolled had	much.	7.380959442811416
15278. and besides the chick had a little something the others didn't	have.	9.841189775529406
15279. that was gonna be fun collecting!   but not just	yet.	9.537380337100918
15280. he liked to savor his meat before	he tasted it.	13.541536369646535
15281. come sit he repeated motioning to the piled	hay bags over the pig leavings.	5.843289904990168
15282. i'm just a poor ex-jazz man name	of- uh- boyd smith.	4.999788870166861
15283. he grinned at them wolfishly.	12.127026643485452
15284. that ain't your name mister the boy accused.	11.157555697850237
15285. and	you know- you're right! feathertop aimed a finger at	him.	6.460370037324521
15286. oh come on cappy the girl chided.	10.398550832016166
15287. she started to move toward the hay bags	dragging the reluctant cappy behind her.	7.00173310305524
15288. feathertop watched	the smooth scissoring of her slim trim legs as she walked to the bags	and tucked them beneath her smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle.	6.493959464418854
15289. he cleared his throat; it had been a long hot while since he'd	seen anything as nice as this within grabbin' distance.	6.483297526472178
15290. he had it all doped of course.	15.276262627898989
15291. slug the kid grab his dough- at least	enough to get to philadelphia- and then have a rockin' ball	with the doll.	5.641027435357644
15292. hmm- diddle!   where'd you come from	mr- uh- mr smith?	8.196044167676531
15293.  kitty inquired politely.	10.363724110347151
15294. out.	19.804021762487697
15295. i been riding train for a ways	now.	9.95288923829895
15296. they lapsed into silence and the freight wallowed up	a hill scooted down the other side shaking and clanking to itself.	8.305762197928454
15297. after a while kitty murmured something to cappy and he held	her close answering we'll just have to wait till we pull into	philly honey.	6.41714271848313
15298. what's the matter she wanna go the	bathroom?	7.655154610114022
15299.  ernie found it immensely funny.	8.254441635698543
15300. the boy scowled	at him and the girl looked shocked.	12.247078713141354
15301. no! certainly not	i mean no that isn't what i said! she snapped at him.	5.542917982132687
15302. i only said i was hungry.	13.93195501835056
15303. we haven't had anything to eat all	day.	9.735002738047672
15304. joviality suffused feathertop ernie cargill's voice	as he reached behind him pulling out a battered carpet bag with	leather handles.	6.54093796655646
15305. whyn't ya say so fellow travelers! why we	got dinner right here.	6.002446559592496
15306. c'mon buddy help me set up the kitchen and	we'll have food in a minute or two.	7.062020727473021
15307. cappy looked wary	but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to	the center of the refuse-littered boxcar.	5.5933345528998295
15308. ernie crouched and	opened the carpet bag.	9.670406878971576
15309. he took out a small packet filled with bits of	charcoal a deep pot of thin metal some sheets of newspaper a book	of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with	holes in it.	5.126543219685414
15310. he put the charcoal in the pot lit the paper with the	matches and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot.	9.403690298192588
15311. a charcoal pit man he said indicating the	slightly-smoking	makeshift brazier.	7.563545188002981
15312. fan it he told cappy handing him	a sheet of newspaper.	8.415898018816554
15313. yeah but what're we gonna eat?	7.622507342753323
15314. 	charcoal?	19.804021762487697
15315.    fella ernie waggled a dirty finger at	the younger man you try my ever-lovin' patience.	5.542917982132687
15316. he reached	once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners.	8.52351370118872
15317. not the greatest but they stick to your belly	insides.	8.940878361709158
15318. he ripped down the cellophane carefully and laid	three dogs on the tin foil.	8.824820353737188
15319. almost immediately they began to sizzle.	10.155668799903394
15320. he looked up and grinned.	15.385132030882776
15321. a kroger's self-serve he	explained.	11.781091587713144
15322. when they had licked the	last of the wieners' taste from their fingers they settled back	and cappy offered ernie a cigarette.	8.784928994875889
15323. nice kid ernie thought	too bad.	9.34245704977057
15324. how come you're riding the rods kids like you?	9.981564148579817
15325. 	ernie asked.	12.292407525564322
15326. cappy looked down at his wide hands and	did not reply.	8.460427663730693
15327. but surprisingly kitty's face came up and she said	my father.	8.215641403132352
15328. he didn't want us to get married.	8.371891266111776
15329. why didn't he want you to get hitched?	10.618673354017204
15330. 	this time even she did not answer.	9.803934985385947
15331. she looked down at her hands too.	9.995947520348533
15332. after a few seconds she said dad didn't like cappy.	12.325120038710505
15333. cappy's head came around sharply.	8.254441635698543
15334. your fault	hell! it was all my fault.	10.970609199129902
15335. if i'd been careful it never woulda-	he stopped abruptly.	8.847147922174463
15336. what's	the matter?	15.594944937291627
15337.    the girl still did not raise her	eyes but she added simply i'm pregnant.	6.578982329721101
15338. oh he was stupid her old man! you never heard nothin'	like it: kitty's gonna go have an abortion and kitty's	gonna go away to a convent and kitty's this and kitty's that h	like he was nuts or somethin' y'know?	6.001522390580316
15339.    ernie nodded.	12.292407525564322
15340. this was a slightly different matter.	19.046401905705412
15341. he remembered midge and the	child.	12.127026643485452
15342. but that had been a time before all this a time he didn't	think about.	11.870409943990316
15343. a time before the white lightning and the bumming had	turned him inside out.	6.40132428842376
15344. but these kids weren't like him.	16.743863813164296
15345. oh	crap! he thought pull out of it old son.	9.834505603095515
15346. these are just another	couple of characters to roll.	11.376224952521977
15347. what they got you get.	14.637919672247627
15348. now forget	all this other.	15.364229980974233
15349. wanna drink?	12.292407525564322
15350.  ernie offered taking	the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket.	7.615092762846159
15351. the answer came from the open door of the boxcar.	11.558487453019104
15352. from the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside as the train	had slowed on the grade.	9.652838240700783
15353. ernie stared at the man.	8.254441635698543
15354. real big with shoulders out to here and hair all over him like	a grizzly.	7.032105024464237
15355. you gonna give	me a drink fella?	11.823504411807077
15356.  the big man asked again taking a step into the	boxcar.	10.121051097733616
15357. this character could break	him in half.	10.120218108434937
15358. sure he said and lifted the pint to his own lips.	9.374962061086082
15359. he guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered	the remainder.	7.560809233574742
15360. the man stalked toward them his big boots heavy	on the wooden flooring.	10.455105502951271
15361. he took the bottle with undue belligerence	and making sucking noises with his thick lips drained it completely.	6.860139917326353
15362. he threw his head back closed his eyes and belched ferociously.	10.792077073429509
15363. he belched again and opening his eyes threw the bottle out the	open door.	6.955990454870539
15364. well now he said and reached into his pocket.	11.29585645610775
15365. i didn't know i was gonna have company in this car.	5.8892535864671345
15366. we're going to philadelphia kitty said pulling her skirt	down around her legs all the more.	5.8055360621897165
15367. no i don't think	so said the big man and it was the final clincher for ernie.	7.557159997504777
15368. he	had suspected this guy was trouble and now he was sure of it.	7.744304979455233
15369. maybe you and me will girlie but these two ain't goin' nowhere.	7.341749202290255
15370. he advanced on them and abruptly there was a shocked	electricity in the car.	9.73453812619693
15371. ernie was screaming inside himself: no	damn you you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me!	the newcomer stalked toward them and kitty shied back her hand	to her mouth.	4.625142923266387
15372. her scream split up the silence of the car accompanied	by the rattling of the freight and then cappy came off the floor	his legs driving him hard.	7.179932855170498
15373. the kid hit the bigger man with an audible	thwump! and carried him backward in a footballer's tackle.	6.288556869610567
15374. they	went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but	flailing arms and legs.	8.612089542705037
15375. the kid showed for an instant and his	arm was cocked back.	7.938185127948141
15376. the fist went down into the pile of flesh and	ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go aaawww!	then they were tumbling again and the big man reached into the	same pocket he had gone for earlier and came up with a vicious switchblade.	6.372396627172946
15377. he held the knife aloft an instant- an instant enough	to press the stud.	6.955990454870539
15378. the blade came out with a snick! he fisted	the knife overhand and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat.	7.997216589624083
15379. kitty screamed insanely and her face was white.	6.764147616291221
15380. she grabbed	at feathertop's sleeve and shrieked help him! help him!	do something!	they neither liked nor disliked the old man.	7.39595678659273
15381. to them he could	have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and	after mass and at noon and at six each evening- its tone repetitive	monotonous never breaking the boredom of the streets.	5.34037632626635
15382. the old	man was unimportant.	16.775915993935868
15383. yet if he were not there they would have	missed him as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against	the screen door in early june; or the smell of thick tomato paste-	the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour- rising up from	aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth.	5.197020362716015
15384. or the surging whirling	sounds of bats at night when their black bodies dived into the blackness	above and below the amber street lights.	7.42240672613908
15385. or the bay of female	dogs in heat.	9.962920974967497
15386. they never called him by name although he had	one.	10.372209341984666
15387. filippo rossi that's what he was called in the old country;	but here he was just signore or the old man.	6.061318658395518
15388. but this was	not unusual because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance	from its elders.	8.785448670329446
15389. it went to church	on sunday and one saturday a month went to confession.	7.7671880347284485
15390. but youth	asked nothing of its parents- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given	in passing.	8.602348042572801
15391. the only thing unusual about the old man had	long since happened.	9.124782246678729
15392. but the past was dead here as the present was dead.	11.143652720863852
15393. once the old man had had a wife.	11.1970385609203
15394. and once she too ignored him.	15.049283460600176
15395. with a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders she wiggled her	satin-covered buttocks down the street before him and didn't stop.	6.6077447227765385
15396. in one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw	suitcase.	11.702679617295658
15397. the way she strutted down the street the old man would	have been blind not to have noticed both.	6.911510886400083
15398. without looking at him	without looking at anything except drexel street directly in front of	her she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars rode away in	it and never came back.	7.5007474407743935
15399. but she shouldn't have come here	in the first place the women had said.	9.338574244658842
15400. she thought she was bigger than we are because she came from	torino.	9.236065548037757
15401. eh torino! she gave herself fancy airs!	just because she had a part on the stage in the old country she thought	she could carry her head higher than ours.	5.898116075118373
15402. they had slapped	their thighs.	22.01765758212555
15403. it's not for making pretty speeches about dante	those actresses get paid so good.	3.071724701317238
15404. henh! calloused	fingers caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries had	swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted	never to be tweezed away.	6.524552326675513
15405. mauve-colored mouths that had never known	anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's	tongue had not smiled but had condemned again and again.	4.825818463470176
15406. puttana!	but if the old man even thought about his wife	now nobody cared a fig.	7.032105024464237
15407. it was enough for people to know that at	one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman	he had consumed- watching her become thinner and thinner in the	distance as thin as the seams on her stockings and still thinner.	5.669674680146378
15408. his	voice had not commanded her to stop.	9.060328853487057
15409. it had not questioned why.	25.200267491386647
15410. the	women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell; but he	might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog	onto him.	6.248375062276051
15411. and his eyes- those miniature	sundials of variegated yellow- had not altered their expression	or direction.	6.531657437679598
15412. the old man's very soul could have left him and	flown down that street but he wouldn't have had anyone know it.	7.861734853708281
15413. perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come	from and where it was taking his wife.	7.034751619892249
15414. but when he called for his	withered wrinkled sister rose to care for him and the children had	he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of	her climbing into that streetcar?	8.150792801340772
15415.    there seemed to be a contemptuous	purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to drexel	street and his back in opposition to the church behind him.	10.43214077104861
15416. for all	he saw or cared to see this could have been a town in italy not the	outskirts of philadelphia.	8.56780653591443
15417. it could have been bari or chieti for	the way it smelled.	12.931610758806517
15418. what did it matter to him that the park at the foot	of ash road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the	stucco station into the city's center at half-hour intervals?	6.8396998166226455
15419.  or	that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the	schuylkill?	6.210871206873012
15420. 	this place was hatred to him just as hatred was his only companion	in his aloneness.	6.886249538313906
15421. to him they were one and the same.	10.90875137997135
15422. sameness	for the old man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided	these quarters from the city.	6.701103422023002
15423. sameness lined the streets with two-story	houses the color of ash.	7.180986566339993
15424. it slashed the sloping manure-scented	lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches.	9.119726373603218
15425. it swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges	of screen doors.	7.456160179316808
15426. even the stable-garage which housed nothing	now but the scent of rot had a lawn before it.	8.543253900949068
15427. and the coffee shop	on drexel street where the men spent their evenings and sundays	playing cards had a rose hedge beneath its window.	5.916605638200641
15428. the hedge reeked	of coffee dregs thrown against it.	10.582206877639416
15429. only one house on the street	had no lawn before it.	8.504321322767934
15430. it squatted low and square upon the sidewalk	with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade.	8.824488116887618
15431. above it from a second-story showroom wooden angels surveyed	the neighborhood.	7.213738653230417
15432. did the old man remember them there?	10.645658068567197
15433. 	yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks-	like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill rising with	the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery.	5.138466329122399
15434. only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses	into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards	owned no fences where one man's property blended with the next	to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy.	6.120167909675211
15435. love and hatred and	fear were one here shaded only by fig trees and grape vines.	5.551925244582443
15436. and the	forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to	back porch.	8.286483984364033
15437. the old man silently fed upon these streets.	9.542945442222504
15438. they	kept him alive waiting.	11.568363037656766
15439. waiting for what and for whom only he could	tell and would not.	6.369482936051812
15440. it was as though he had made a pact with the	devil himself but it was not yet time to pay the price.	13.780953780840136
15441. he was holding	out for something.	15.66991192537313
15442. he was determined to hold out.	17.218119440805356
15443. the old	man's son threw himself down belly first upon a concrete step	taking in the coolness of it and dreaming of the day he would be rich.	6.775895824308829
15444. at fifteen he didn't care that he had no mother that he couldn't	remember her face or her touch; neither did he care that aunt rose	provided for him.	7.534709229949473
15445. he was named pompeii as a tribute to his	heritage and he couldn't have cared less about that either.	7.12602644688808
15446. to him	life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended	only with sleep.	8.492006313869402
15447. when he would be a man he would be a rich	man.	16.102449493734653
15448. he would not be like the rich americans who lived in white-columned	houses on the other side of the park.	15.672836759537294
15449. he would not ride the	eight-thirty local to the city each morning.	12.226423653899834
15450. he would not carry a brief	case.	21.028519561200955
15451. nor would he work at all.	9.225965683634323
15452. he would square his shoulders and	carry a cane before each step.	11.126773520398459
15453. he would sit inside the coffee shop	and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and	come running bowing with her running calling out in her bowing at	your service.	5.893647793461192
15454. he would order her to bring coffee and would take	from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff- he would	not remove his gloves- and light and smoke.	6.8921799235904855
15455. he could do that when	he would be a man.	13.983800822184625
15456. hey laura! he called to his sister	on the porch above the steps.	7.391013650626644
15457. she was only ten months older than	he.	10.731278724007474
15458. laura what would you say if i smoked a pipe?	7.879513779734377
15459.    laura	did not answer him.	9.118533821976325
15460. she leaned unconcerned against the broken porch	fence brushing and drying her wet gilded hair in the sun.	7.555676063005962
15461. one lithe	leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking	torn pales.	7.165084184249607
15462. her tanned foot whose arch swept high and white pointed	artfully toward tapering toes- toes like fingers whose tips glowed	white.	6.871444601812444
15463. all the while she sat there her sinewy arms swirled before her	chest.	7.838589637235464
15464. her face showed no sign of having heard pompeii.	9.169907062155023
15465. it	was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to	fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines	of its contours.	4.992567046757238
15466. the eyes blue and always somewhat downcast possessed	a sullen quality.	10.179938564603429
15467. even though the boy could not see them he knew	they were clouded by distance.	8.84004772361222
15468. he was never sure they fully took	him in.	15.247082972976871
15469. pompeii called again laura! but the only answer	that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg	moving against it.	5.253489966882827
15470. she's in a mood he thought there's	not a month she doesn't get herself in a mood.	5.988301681208439
15471. well	what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams	to dream about?	6.269573517613578
15472.  and as for his pipe if he wanted to smoke one	nobody would stop him.	10.728041958152955
15473. suddenly he was interrupted	in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin	and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat's claret tongue	feasting against the salt taste of him.	4.877035459880043
15474. above the tongue an aged	yellow eye sallow and time-cast encrusted within a sphere of marbleized	pink skin stared unfalteringly at him.	6.946552140752865
15475. christ sake	goat git! but the goat would not.	7.023258681873877
15476. you're boiling	milk ain't you?	9.011594807050702
15477.  soothing it with his hand knowing the whiskered	jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly	to his touch.	5.3197614127173525
15478. his head undulated gradually covering	space to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth	of those teats.	7.09619181072902
15479. with his mouth opened wide he squirted the warm	white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light	earthy taste of it.	5.394454072241314
15480. the boy's fingers and mouth operated with	the skilled unity of a bagpipe player pressing and pulling delighting	in what he did.	7.068970569960655
15481. above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm	cloud.	7.590421290199592
15482. its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane.	9.090697400031273
15483. but the	boy could see only the goat's belly.	9.374544754266388
15484. the old man near the	corner let the shadow pass over him sensing something portentous in	it.	8.558239973125177
15485. he knew it was there knew also what it was about but he wouldn't	raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog's back.	7.536942942251085
15486. there would	be time enough perhaps the old man reassured himself to pay the	devil his due.	9.339118417061636
15487. time enough to give up his soul.	13.613444056214224
15488. in the meantime	six sandals stained an ocher the same color as pompeii's shaved	hair edged up close to him.	9.134431189244589
15489. the clapping they made on the concrete	interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew so that he quickly	released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches	for ticks.	5.943784273861791
15490. he knew at a glance that the biggest sandals	belonged to niobe the neatest ones to concetta and the laced ones	to romeo concetta's idiot brother.	7.640029465141078
15491. pompeii expected romeo's	small body to sink closer and closer to the ground.	7.199328088863325
15492. he expected concetta's	thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy and her shrill impetuous	voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that	was never sure of hearing anything.	6.6395522357977095
15493. people came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it.	9.576639905592378
15494. the room filled with smoke and maggie's head throbbed with excitement	and fatigue but stuart had such a happy earnest look of proud	possession on his face that maggie couldn't bear to do anything to	quench it.	6.718403895670843
15495. little anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery.	7.5959474176628765
15496. in two months she became a fat highly social baby with a fuzz	of flaxen hair all over her head.	7.627671452943762
15497. she stopped flying into rages and	started digesting her food; she developed a peaches and cream complexion	and a sunny disposition and she asked for nothing more of life	than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food	at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity	going on around her.	4.444658329666444
15498. she was so heavy that maggie's arms shook	from lifting her and taking care of her.	9.221216110182969
15499. maggie couldn't seem	to	get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do:	there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety	old washer and lugged out and lugged back; there was the daily round	of household chores in which maggie insisted on participating.	4.495196716208382
15500. worry	had a great deal to do with it; stuart had been laid off at the	produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office	taking what salary his father could hand out to him.	7.7087274665229915
15501. mr clifton	would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with	his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's	upkeep and besides that there were the things that had to be bought	for the baby	milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap just plain soap.	5.167450678575642
15502. maggie and stuart pored over figures every night trying to find how	they could squeeze out a few pennies more.	7.271224592364519
15503. in desperation maggie	consulted eugenia one afternoon: do you think you could	find me something i could do here at home to make some money so i could	still watch the baby and do the rest of the things?	6.2085188608883675
15504.    it	seems to me you have enough to do as it is eugenia said.	11.442952128326786
15505. she	had been watching maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to	the stove and back again.	5.593722792787349
15506. i have plenty of odd moments when	i could be doing something maggie said.	11.036377174247496
15507. it would make me	feel a lot better but the woman's exchange isn't taking baked goods	any more and i can't leave the baby with grandma because she	isn't strong enough and the baby's too young to be put in a nursery.	6.047805560224772
15508. i should think so eugenia said.	18.979082613988822
15509. for one thing	you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the	skin out nineteen times a day.	6.452912629329701
15510. she's so beautiful	and i do like to keep her looking nice.	6.1697941426634
15511. she picked	up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck.	7.187557404882245
15512. she'll	be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be ironed	eugenia said.	8.058234557986617
15513. evadna mae evans said she didn't put a thing on	her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old.	5.393085136057858
15514. evadna mae evans got all her baby clothes from best's liliputian	bazaar in new york and i'm sick and tired of hearing about	evadna mae evans.	7.0131976762567785
15515. well now maggie you don't	have to snap at me eugenia said.	7.164012087738624
15516. i'm just thinking of a way	for you to be sensible.	5.308909254180805
15517. i do seem to snap	at everybody these days but i would like to think of a way to make	a little extra money.	10.534561312873164
15518. let's make	a list of your assets.	8.190298960396978
15519. maggie started laughing and she laughed	so hard she couldn't stop and she kept on laughing while she lugged	the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still	shining.	4.950568402933095
15520. when she came back eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table	with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures.	8.179291906149384
15521. i have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working	mothers	eugenia said.	8.356970876603308
15522. we could put up cribs on the second floor	sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it's	nice and sunny but of course it would entail quite a bit of running	up and down stairs and chris said you were to be careful about that.	7.026201841011943
15523. what else?	20.454815948573874
15524.    you might set up a dress	shop in the	living room.	15.2935656841733
15525. every woman in the block has tried that.	7.452451036283637
15526. what about a tea room then?	13.126227377958582
15527.  you could set up tables	in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread	and grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes.	5.54442202442552
15528. and grandma isn't strong enough to take	on something like that and to tell you the truth neither am i.	9.073242362632866
15529. she said well those are the really interesting	things but if you don't like any of those i can turn over some	of my extra typing jobs to you if you think you can type well enough.	4.980050452116372
15530. oh i'm sure i could do that maggie said.	11.656546293871285
15531. but	it really wouldn't be fair taking your jobs away from you.	6.824505404037339
15532. don't worry i can get plenty more eugenia said wondering	where in the world she could.	5.555691619951919
15533. maggie was looking much happier	already clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could	put up a typewriter right there and be brushing up on her typing	so eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it.	4.998336185344618
15534. and then whenever i have	a minute i can be working at it and keep an eye on the baby and the	stove at the same time.	8.789922781860477
15535. and i can go back to my contests and be thinking	while i'm doing the washing.	7.600681703210085
15536. what are you going	to do with your feet so you don't waste anything?	10.758814973429546
15537.    maggie	laughed.	15.610129252044759
15538. she said oh eugenia i wish h   what?	12.891277496569838
15539. 	i wish i had three wishes maggie said.	6.764147616291221
15540. all	of them for you.	13.55611807036522
15541. it grew bitterly cold toward the end of november	contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people.	8.736777155764715
15542. the temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during	the days.	8.743398333851205
15543. the cold settled like a tangible pall over the mile	high city locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and	altered its physical appearance; it had a look of grim stark realism	resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold instead of	the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy western city basking in eternal	sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and	resources.	4.495480624684859
15544. the jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment	offices outside newspaper buildings in parks in relief lines	outside government agencies.	8.00317610848465
15545. there weren't facilities to take care	of them; there never had been a need felt for such facilities.	7.437702630866911
15546. that	kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the east	which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested	populations and their greedy centralization of industries protected	by discriminatory freight rates.	6.286558561528069
15547. the east was popularly supposed	to have got the country into war and into depression dragging the west	along; and now the east was creating government agencies for which	the west doubtless would have to pay.	5.92410288192423
15548. the government offices	were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile	the cold penetrated everything.	8.296253428209805
15549. shivering people talked and	argued; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow	but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate	remedies and something had to be done.	7.021453948308087
15550. something had to be done;	it was the theme song of millions of american people their personal	problems no less urgent than those of the government.	9.526180786068714
15551. something	had to be done.	9.118533821976325
15552. the abernathys said it to each other a dozen times	a day.	10.918302091707263
15553. something had to be done about the furnace the fuel bills	the washing machine the doctor and dentist bills about making	money stretch for food for the mortgage for taxes for shoes for half	soles for overshoes	for clothes for the new leaks in the roof for gas	and light bills; about keeping warm about keeping well about meeting	the minor emergencies that came up once twice fifty times a day.	5.10604159510992
15554. just dropping the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe	and stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major	disaster.	7.3590573327102184
15555. the abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant	ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its	evil red depths and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained	cold.	6.321838060964414
15556. cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung	up under doors around loosened window frames from the sleeping	porches the attic from the widened cracks between shingles on the	roof.	6.726158168431265
15557. presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity	and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen which had never been	removed when the new gas range was installed and the fireplaces and	an electric heater in grandma's room.	5.581872482453997
15558. it was so cold and so wretched	that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them like people	stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance	so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only	important thing was to cling together and survive.	7.320235383712549
15559. the pipes	burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while	they swabbed the bathrooms.	5.8853245991998815
15560. they lived mainly in the kitchen; they	moved maggie's bed and the baby's basket there and the rest of	them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper	polar regions and plunged into icy beds.	6.430465068775621
15561. grandma said it was just	like the early mining camp days and it was the way people ought to live	only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she	used to.	6.290666739933361
15562. you said a mouthful eugenia said grimly.	13.503944917508555
15563. eugenia	hated being cold worse than anything and she was beginning to	find the joys of poverty wearing thin.	6.053151048943948
15564. she said to maggie that it was	one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it and it was	beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever.	8.176486304488268
15565. plenty of people are poor all their lives.	7.314227633940756
15566. plenty of	people haven't our brains and talent.	9.060328853487057
15567. i know you when	you start talking about brains and talent maggie said.	8.274249056299203
15568. you're	working up to something and if you don't watch out you'll ruin	your whole life one of these days just to prove that the abernathy	family is superior to everything even a depression.	5.578759053494224
15569. the	only thing that worries me is how i'm going to prove it eugenia	said.	5.937465667031861
15570. they begged grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen	for her but grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange	beds and be seen with her teeth out and that she hoped to die in	privacy like a christian and if the lord willed it to be of pneumonia	than it would have to be that way.	7.37400327128832
15571. she didn't want to be the only	one with a stove in her room especially as her life span was nearly	run out anyway and she insisted that hope have the heater.	5.101877205742908
15572. hope wouldn't	hear of it and she took the heater back to grandma's room	and grandma took it back to hope's room and the two of them dragged	it back and forth until grandma tipped it over and almost set her	bedspread on fire.	6.841344915124057
15573. she said that proved she wasn't to be trusted	with a fire in her room and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody	knowing it.	6.009688513625728
15574. eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the	heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth	and still wanted her own way but hope said if grandma wouldn't have	the heater nobody would have it so grandma had to give in.	5.6679102173306
15575. thrifty of her to use it up.	9.501816810960271
15576. unusual in a case like this	but-   you can joke! didn't you read it?	7.646569250809713
15577.  she's	married that tenant!   i read it yes.	7.14162538120728
15578. this ought	to simplify tolley's life.	14.348401121477856
15579. laban had more to say.	8.254441635698543
15580. tolley	had gone to live in california.	14.390963444086943
15581. he'd mentioned it himself	at church	and everybody seemed to have the idea that tolley had left because jenny	had jilted him for roy robards.	6.2808616059855495
15582. it was plain as the nose	on your face that they're laughing about it mamma.	10.904928767278548
15583. zion stayed	to get my pin but it'll be a cold day in june when i go back.	5.236383152695367
15584. we will both go back laban! kizzie turned to go inside.	10.884879163358585
15585. let me stay and take the pictures you wanted mamma.	9.610246324588674
15586. the sun's	right-   pictures?	18.83174821599479
15587.  she swung around.	15.247579096077972
15588. what	pictures?	19.804021762487697
15589.    in brace's room! you told me to	bring my camera.	8.694445957554716
15590. i'm not going back-   indeed you are!	why should i want pictures of an empty room now?	4.69843893841529
15591.  tolley	had no idea of marrying that sneaky little jenny! this- trip of	his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants and i am going	to see that everybody at mt pleasant understands that simple fact.	5.097902332895639
15592. wait for me laban i'll be dressed in half a second!	frank followed her into the bedroom hooked her dress up the back.	6.221143152558621
15593. hurry frank! they're not going to laugh at the	fairbrothers and labans very long! tolley's going is my	fault.	5.926041316002191
15594. you know it and i'll tell everybody	exactly how it happened.	12.294329065738522
15595. she was so beautiful so valiant	so pitiable.	10.731278724007474
15596. make your confession to god kizzie	dear not to the congregation.	10.617736352682517
15597. i'll decide that when	i get there.	4.8393280814891115
15598. i was so cruel to tolley so unfair.	13.53487361518177
15599. but i'll	be fair now! he is coming back isn't he frank?	7.793238909001978
15600. 	yes oh yes.	13.148092146312546
15601. what else was there to say?	10.34648963827048
15602.  returning to the log-house	he found some favorite lines from jonathan swift on his lips:	under the window in stormy weather   i marry this man	and woman together.	6.91316600044924
15603. let none but him who rules the thunder	put this man and woman asunder.	7.070851708123198
15604. absolution for his lie?	11.568363037656766
15605. 	he questioned god's taking time to telegraph the message but	he felt better about kizzie and he took the sealed envelope from its	pigeonhole wondering why he had preserved it.	5.037911153425335
15606. if he died before she	did she would never be unable to resist opening it.	10.008371193129557
15607. in any case he	would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons making them parties	to a deception peculiarly his own.	6.93736699822844
15608. it was simply his necessity	to confess which had made him write and keep this thing.	10.434987960680747
15609. you've	told god frank he said.	8.254441635698543
15610. why lacerate the- congregation?	15.604009980076775
15611. 	reaching for an old clay pot relic of pioneer days he tore	the envelope in pieces dropping them into it touching the little	pyre to flame watching it curl the red sealing wax melting and bubbling	in the feathery ash.	4.50981904668096
15612. surely now his beloved son could rest in peace.	8.3386589614121
15613. 'and let me go for the night gathers me and in the	night shall no man gather fruit'.	5.889229885406488
15614. a beautiful and haunting line	a subtle genius swinburne difficult not to envy a gifted man and	perhaps he did h.	7.049965577405743
15615. but there were great satisfactions even for	a small man.	13.207962979229602
15616. beyond his window were the greening trees new spring	eternal hope eternal life.	8.026533005276175
15617. there lay grand fair's quinzaine	his own young parents' graves but new life and promise for his sons	grandsons.	6.8984630165675
15618. he poured his thimble of wine for the toast he'd made	so often.	9.176540466704445
15619. but this last time he drank not	to brace but to tolley!	mr robards- jenny	was the only person she knew of in the mt pleasant neighborhood	who called him that- was kind but too easygoing.	5.408133901994707
15620. it didn't bother	him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say howdy	miss jenny adding a careless roy but it did her.	6.960537678671962
15621. he could put a stop to it she told him again and again.	8.003780484907342
15622. simply	call mr whipsnade oscar and dr dunne pg	and c'un major frank.	7.615092762846159
15623. mr robards laughed said he'd	feel a damn fool plain-out couldn't do that even to please her.	5.879193567624874
15624. and if i ever hear you say 'mist	laban' again i'll scream.	12.086932825755216
15625. and don't tell me you didn't	at church sunday.	8.652477872231358
15626. i heard you!   he really hadn't	meant to he assured her but it was plain to her that the importance	of these small things was lost on mr robards.	7.578077078063468
15627. how strange it was	that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its	beautiful furnishings and fail her in- spiritual ways.	5.268792315437199
15628. another	weakness- far more irritating than his manner of speaking which	he made only token effort to change- was his devotion to that old horse	of tolley's.	6.321481229627115
15629. but mr robards' now	oh my yes indeed yes! he called her the mare much as mrs	whipsnade spoke of the queen god bless her.	6.398729199499508
15630. h he with	fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there	in the barn was reverent only of the mare the racin'	mare the revolting gunny.	6.968927568840587
15631. for the first few months of their	marriage she had tried to be nice about gunny going out with him	to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall.	6.698860701671717
15632. and what had happened?	21.79500841751721
15633.  gunny invariably tried to bite her.	7.622507342753323
15634. nerves	mr robards said just a nip anyway.	9.060328853487057
15635. stand back miss jen	she's oneasy of your scarf.	6.963789813011961
15636. never quit that you sor'l	devil! never concern for his wife's nerves or the danger	that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in	january.	6.119783323904664
15637. she musn't annoy gunny whose foal was due then	too!   listening for hours to his laments that the war and mist	fair's poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing	triumph and to his predictions of greatness for the procession	of foals to come jenny could look forward to years of conflict with	an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it.	4.878367040876121
15638. gunny symbolized	so much that was unpleasant- tolley the indifference with which	the fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her	and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband his lack	of understanding and sympathy in her present condition her disgusting	swollen stomach.	5.518383679066012
15639. human birth was no novelty to mr robards.	6.942239804543554
15640. tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick he suggested.	7.391013650626644
15641. jenny's aversion to having dr dunne a former admirer seemed	silly to him but he would humor her get anybody she wanted the best	never being too good for her.	4.808576448439271
15642. the chances were against his	being here to humor her when her time came she was sure.	8.083288008395126
15643. he would be	in the barn or riding for the veterinarian! night after night he	stayed with gunny in the dead of winter rubbing her with quarts of	expensive liniment fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte	russe tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come	to the house.	5.223694110566044
15644. yet when the dear baby came he had tillie over here	in a jiffy and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when	it was all over as any husband could have been.	6.397599092381136
15645. jenny wished	now that she had had dr dunne feeling that somehow he wouldn't	have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets.	5.77300031951152
15646. there was something	not nice about triplets though their father seemed pleased showing	no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted saying	you don't see triplets trippin' down the pike ever' day	miss jen hon.	7.256523385000329
15647. rhyme 'em up cute- arcilla flotilla h	edmonia for her mother she said firmly jennifer for herself	and-   kezziah for miss kizzie he suggested.	5.078552481116961
15648. she	was mighty good to you past times an' this'll fetch her.	7.6924205076212635
15649. now	she must be thinking of a boy-name something special.	6.89152215456979
15650. just wait till	she saw the mare's foal.	11.495411112805801
15651. handsomest colt in all kentucky.	8.254441635698543
15652. strong	too up on his legs when he was an hour old.	9.653499265318345
15653. what about royal robards?	13.359616238729945
15654. 	why don't you name him jesus christ!	she burst into tears.	7.879513779734377
15655. he'd had	no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been.	6.210871206873012
15656. of course she wasn't	herself right now but as her strength came back her spirits didn't	seem to rise with it.	8.304789519877946
15657. he had a good idea why not.	17.353531954689558
15658. those elegant at	home cards she sent out now she could wear her pretty clothes	again and had the house all trimmed up hadn't brought many callers	in two whole months.	6.707707965368423
15659. doc dunne and miss sis had come.	7.14162538120728
15660. so	had miss shawnee rakestraw full of criticisms about the changes here	giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his heavenly	rest last year saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town	in inclement weather was looking forward to quinzaine spa this summer.	5.639226945096729
15661. miss kizzie had been right snippy	ever since they were married though you'd have thought a namesake	would	have brought her round.	5.431879171226599
15662. oh she'd come to see them once left silver	teething rings for all of the trips.	10.966284788691604
15663. but when miss jen went over	right away to return the call miss kiz couldn't have been very	cordial for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there.	5.898583607792321
15664. more and more these days she'd been driving that pretty little	mare that looked like her over to tillie's and nick's- his own	old square frame box on posts chickens and cats and pups under the	house everybody friendly inside making a to-do over the babies dressed	like dollies.	6.0013714484459095
15665. though he was glad she got on well with his young folks	she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land too.	6.696436383152329
15666. it made him pretty hot under the collar after the idea miss sis	had given him to be told by miss kiz that her holy spa was all reserved	for this summer and next if you please and that much as	she regretted it they would be unable to entertain mrs robards and	the children.	6.768449959517164
15667. she hoped they were well.	11.145752833777212
15668. he didn't tell miss	jen but she must have got word from the cook or nurse who of course	knew those quinzaine nigs and she really took a fit.	5.80028435735037
15669. if he ever	did such a thing again she'd die of shame.	9.167733270352041
15670. have a	party an' leave 'em out hon he suggested.	11.476046029559635
15671. a swell party	send an invite to ever'body but them- those folks you met	at the galt house the ones i've got to know in this new jockey	club affair the whole dang neighborhood.	5.07812826545083
15672. we'll have oystchers-	couple bar'l oystchers'll fetch in a crowd any time.	5.521386603555391
15673. i'll see	word gets round.	5.167542196274223
15674. don't you dare!   miss	jen was	funny that way funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and	perk up.	3.8905888889019447
15675. he was downright worried about her but there was one more	thing he could try h.	9.20250917108241
15676. zion was surprised when roy's buggy	stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking	home from the country school where she was teaching now that eph showers	had had a call to preach in some mountain town.	6.11002210101133
15677. roy smiled-	he did have a nice smile- took off his hat most politely	told her to hop in and he'd give her a lift to quinzaine.	5.033664462445768
15678. her hesitation	was only momentary and she hoped he didn't notice it as she	settled herself asked quickly how miss jenny and the babies were	getting on.	6.42623539572226
15679. see for yourself miss zion.	10.985385741679188
15680. it won't take	a minute.	12.419975400263999
15681. he swung in through his own wide gateway.	9.026368296067464
15682. them's	the purtiest babes you ever did see but miss jen gets mighty lonesome.	7.198778874655976
15683. she'll relish the sight of a friendly face.	6.220255690688065
15684. miss kiz won't	care your comin' will she?	10.408343380870077
15685.    why of course not zion	said uncomfortably.	9.684323749366209
15686. he must have forgiven me henrietta murmured to the room.	11.327606069831942
15687. the absolution of doaty's last will and testament was proof enough	of that; doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman.	5.869500549532433
15688. she found herself wishing an old wish that she had told doaty	she was running away that she had left something more behind her	than the loving sorry note and her best garnet pin.	7.231913172635931
15689. perhaps doaty	had guessed already and kept her counsel.	8.338909651164993
15690. henrietta thought it's	extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us.	7.391013650626644
15691. there	had been more to know about hetty inevitably and most of it unfavorable.	10.041412780497474
15692. adelia was the good one or if not always good less frequently	tempted.	7.922748732483108
15693. their childhood would have been quite circumspect without	hetty's flair for drama especially through the long summers.	6.04974776899928
15694. in	winter in the city there had been the maneret school which taught	excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge; there had	been lessons in french from a small polish nobleman with a really	profound distaste for his pupils; there had been the dancing class-	miss craddock thin and tireless with her supervising wand and her	everlasting one-two-three one-two-three.	6.785702337920414
15695. there had been supper	parties and teas fetes and little balls mama small and pretty	and gay and papa enormously jocular enormously possessive the sun	around	which the blackwell planets revolved.	6.175052815726565
15696. mama had died before	the corruption of the family circle the interruption of charles.	8.114483899514362
15697. it was safe to assume that papa sighing heavily had said many times	to his remaining daughter thank god your poor mother was spared	this and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for henrietta	to leave with her hand in charles' hand just because	her poor	mother was gone already and would never know.	5.459005583534792
15698. mama was vulnerable;	one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her.	8.610411877378892
15699. but i would have gone anyway thought henrietta.	16.5120083827024
15700. she had always	been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no	choice.	10.691691086238723
15701. only at this moment- perhaps because it was before dawn and	she was lying in doaty's bed- she found herself examining how others	might regard her.	6.415941800512939
15702. perhaps they would argue that morality consisted	just of that ability to see a choice.	9.06612560490012
15703. she turned on her side	finding the idea oppressive.	9.004732673333839
15704. if adelia had felt about someone as	henrietta felt about charles would she have run away with him?	8.070616734413823
15705. 	impossible to imagine adelia feeling so about anyone.	6.764147616291221
15706. no temptation no virtue?	15.374207938596363
15707.    a curious	thought to end a curious night.	9.905166252818818
15708. the birds were really awake now in a	colloquy of music and light was beginning to creep across the room	touching sill and door table and chair and all of doaty's flowers	in their artificial blossom and leaf.	6.942199493654511
15709. before anything else she	would go to doaty's grave with flowers from doaty's forgotten	garden.	6.555038966708796
15710. everything must wait upon this mission this sentimental duty	of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards.	7.5506487602418755
15711. she closed her eyes remembering	the small french cemetery enclosed by stone walls.	6.897938509958291
15712. it had	always seemed to rain there and even the grass was gray.	11.54552803647484
15713. after	the sad impatient moment waiting for comfort which could not come	she slipped out of bed and went to the open window.	6.44556132424009
15714. the garden below	was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness.	9.069913781252382
15715. leaning	out	she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle one not quite come	to bloom one just beyond it.	5.3667205324572995
15716. on a thrusting spray thick with thorns	and dewdrops and swelling pink buds like a summer valentine a bird	balanced and sang nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music	a little engine of song.	6.887094715964391
15717. it was so pretty and artless that	she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot	to play on the wet grass with all the growing things but doaty never	permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme	d'un certain age.	5.4274952220539285
15718. feeling suddenly neat and subdued she dressed	quite soberly and went downstairs.	7.615092762846159
15719. rosa unbelievably was	not yet up and about reassurance that rosa was human.	5.825820622377272
15720. feeling protective	toward this sleeping being henrietta found a yesterday bun and	milk in a white jug a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of	going barefoot.	6.09983039226678
15721. outside the garden the tame wilderness yielded	a patchwork bouquet of daisies sweet william scented stock and lady's	bedstraw which she tied with long grasses and took back to show	rosa who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing folly.	4.589841520634019
15722. the poodle came gleefully to henrietta and begged for the flowers	supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws.	7.663024046550707
15723. henrietta held	her bouquet out of reach and said it was for doaty.	7.005717467391782
15724. rummaging in	the dew said rosa coldly.	9.670406878971576
15725. go change your shoes before you turn	around.	8.311057673570838
15726. she sounded so exactly like doaty that henrietta obeyed	her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay	home.	7.3646547782482985
15727. folly danced eager for whatever lay beyond the door.	6.460370037324521
15728. to	a blackwell there was only one church.	11.693355023152229
15729. the cemetery slumbered just	behind it and the way lay through the village and close to the sea.	7.152792821361911
15730. for the first time in thirty years henrietta walked down the narrow	street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying	her with the frankest curiosity.	9.586870493761777
15731. she smiled and bowed recalling	the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child.	7.501524371045103
15732. now some of the acknowledgments were cautious but all were interested.	10.308561420278885
15733. an old man sitting against the wall of a cottage and	waiting for the sun to find him gave her a more than reflective look	as she passed the sap still plainly rising in his branches.	5.309040932049918
15734. on an impulse	she turned back and said good morning.	10.855305855731306
15735. he cupped his ear	and shook his head at her repetition announcing in a nettled way that	he had heard her the first time.	5.908948559750761
15736. he then offered his own estimate	of the weather which was unenthusiastic.	10.741930453852211
15737. summer's been slow to	come he said.	7.622507342753323
15738. it's my dryin' out time.	3.6130210406737766
15739. he scowled at her	flowers.	14.0564280108931
15740. i'm taking them to the cemetery said henrietta	out of a vague feeling of hospitality.	5.199174835539203
15741. they'll be	takin' me next he said pleasantly but not so soon's they	plan.	4.984250438954237
15742. see half of 'em in their graves before i choose my own coffin.	8.374780838429205
15743. it's dryin' myself out that does it.	2.9899422249309215
15744. he regarded her with	rising hope.	15.385132030882776
15745. you'd like to hear how i go about it.	5.806909895252465
15746. it's	nice of you henrietta said doubtfully.	9.670406878971576
15747. he straightened himself soldierly against the wall and	pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their	old boots.	6.834759811295672
15748. his stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became	a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text.	7.3984306975920475
15749. every	month f'r three days he said happily i take no water into	my system no water whatsoever.	5.326519577128725
15750. henrietta	murmured that she could quite see how it would and he nodded approval	of her womanly good sense.	7.305055099656447
15751. rests the tissues he said and	pacifies the system.	6.764147616291221
15752. my dad did it and he lived to a great age.	9.743563436225397
15753. he looked up at her sharply.	10.776005861178222
15754. don't remember do you?	4.112779170864945
15755. 	she did suddenly through the link of memory with his father	old titus who must have been in his nineties when henrietta ran away.	5.795216625306937
15756. next to the blackwells titus had owned the island most and she	and adelia had often stood in front of him silenced by his terrible	years- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like	a mariner more aged than possible.	7.515624776767945
15757. he had never spoken once to the	awed sisters but his son had been friendly a big fellow of fifty	or more a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea.	5.8462805032029665
15758. it must be	that son who sat before her now shriveled to half his size and half	his senses.	10.034743309731502
15759. she said gently of course i remember you.	12.534239389264426
15760. not so well's i remember you he said.	12.991041486721704
15761. y're the	young blackwell woman.	9.118533821976325
15762. ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded	man.	7.879513779734377
15763. i know all about you.	15.401759347390252
15764. you do seem to said	henrietta impressed.	15.000064054538505
15765. can't blame a man for leavin' his	wife he said quite cheerfully.	6.002446559592496
15766. left mine many a time only she	never knew it.	8.449466873348017
15767. man in a boat there's a lot of places he can put	in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit.	6.40110924832612
15768. any harm in that?	13.437452972638015
15769. 	probably said henrietta dryly.	9.118533821976325
15770. he gave	a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly.	10.090191208524187
15771. you'd be the one	to say he observed and she found herself liking his approval none	too well but she could not defend herself and say that her actions	were different since all actions had their own laws.	4.532130734940112
15772. only this	old man's connivance was even less to her taste than selma cotter's	open censure.	8.054746365893974
15773. well she had not come back to great island to	be understood praised or condemned.	6.2801857841972035
15774. she had come to make her peace	with the past and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind	of shadow.	10.011156646714106
15775. she started to move away just as a woman came out	of the cottage a big-boned drab-haired figure with a clean apron	tied over her limp print dress.	5.430059192135477
15776. she smiled vaguely at henrietta and	spoke to the old man.	10.556560702553202
15777. you've not had your breakfast yet gran'dad.	4.970478748803196
15778. y'r dam' porridge is no breakfast he said.	8.581436094141479
15779. milk and sops! he beat the air with his stick and it fell from	his claws and clattered on the stones.	5.620633094809038
15780. he's owly today	his grand-daughter said wearily and bent to pick it up.	5.032898478712399
15781. he's	got this idea about drying out h   it ain't an idea!	if it ain't an idea she said how comes it	you can drink beer but not water?	4.726707772215755
15782.    he looked piously to heaven	and said beer don't affect the tissues none and the ingenious	hypocrisy of this defense pleased henrietta so that she forgave	him his	stint of malevolence.	6.653673092420428
15783. come	on do.	12.292407525564322
15784. the children are eating and miss blackwell's on her way	somewheres.	11.129238092996406
15785. who ain't?	18.82749629128261
15786. 	not me.	15.594944937291627
15787. i've got a day's work to do.	4.532364246555126
15788. you'll be visiting	miss doaty ma'am?	5.110501839626448
15789.    henrietta nodded.	12.292407525564322
15790. how much they	knew about her!   the woman	answered the nod with her own.	9.904893893206141
15791. god rest her soul she was a sweet	one.	9.29419098307867
15792. come on now.	14.11939494765156
15793. she put a strong hand under the old man's	arm and lifted him up patiently with the gentle cruelty and necessary	tyranny that the young show toward the very old.	5.14737491867238
15794. he mumbled at her	but let himself be led off inside the house shuffling mightily to make	it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by	those who still had their wicked strength.	7.486996552755463
15795. there was a gabble	of voices from indoors young hungry sounds like cats after fish and	a burst of swearing from the old man.	7.314501387803211
15796. henrietta looked down at her	bouquet still lively with its color and scent and set her feet on their	journey's way again leaving the village street and crossing the	first field folly dancing ahead of her.	5.887931873159028
15797. at the edge of the	field the wild rolling land took over dotted with fat round bushes like	sheep.	7.91678928788301
15798. they were covered with tiny white blossoms their scant roots	clawing at the stony ground and wild birds darted in and about and	through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry.	6.830766481529004
15799. the air was full of sounds too but placid ones a terrestrial humming	as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky.	8.53599794386547
15800. she felt mindless	walking and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near	the cemetery and she caught herself wondering what she would say to	doaty.	6.7548882021488295
15801. both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered	them but	the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named	dorothy tredding seemed suddenly impossible.	5.218121678816623
15802. she sat	down on the nearest fallen with age and gray with sea-damp her fingers	tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss.	6.902655043690541
15803. the day's sun was gathering its strength in gold and she wished	she had brought her parasol if only to shade doaty's flowers.	6.077157104427059
15804. a small	rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb the only angel	in the cemetery.	7.88014969880378
15805. she remembered suddenly a night of savage	moonlight and scudding clouds when she and adelia having dared each	other had stolen out of their great safe house and come here hand in	hand hoping and fearing ghosts.	4.978406912966332
15806. the momoyama family had come from miyagi prefecture in the	northeast of the main japanese island of honshu where there are still	traces of the mysterious ainu strain.	7.729409380958816
15807. the ainus were a primitive	people already living on the island before the principal ancestors	of the japanese came from southern asia.	5.90330348631672
15808. apparently they were of caucasian	blood.	13.533764698558754
15809. they had white skins and blue eyes; all their men	were bearded and many of their women were beautiful.	7.943081737129854
15810. a pitiful few of	them are left now to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing	their ancient tribal chants which have the same haunting sadness as	the laments of the american indians.	6.830648799095212
15811. most of them have been assimilated	but sometimes a man in miyagi or akita prefectures is much more	hairy than the average japanese and occasionally a girl will be strikingly	lovely her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the	tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the south.	5.791186563505854
15812. tommy	momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions.	15.029229310097719
15813. she was taller than	most japanese girls and had the exquisitely willowy form of the	japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall.	6.4604493830152645
15814. her nose was higher of	bridge her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn	and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth	that were white and regular and strong.	6.430533000013153
15815. her mouth soft and full was	something for any man to dream about.	6.382269394684917
15816. she had black eyes long and	intriguingly tilted and the way she walked was melody.	9.72305902954811
15817. she had	been in japan just one week.	9.130734915764195
15818. it was an alien land and she hated it	intensely; she was already considering putting in rebellious requests	for duty at san diego bremerton the great lakes pensacola-	any place the navy had a hospital- with a threat to resign her commission	if the request were not granted.	6.7726986920563315
15819. anywhere would be better than	the land of her ancestors.	6.945398279765239
15820. there was nothing wrong with her	job.	28.458611130963924
15821. tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward.	6.764147616291221
15822. there were	no depressingly serious cases: the ward doctor sometimes teamed up with	the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor- sometimes the navy	sent people back to the states to preserve a marriage- but mental	health as a rule was very high.	8.320403704837508
15823. at present the doctor's main concern	was in seeing to it that japanese salvage firms were not permitted	to operate on the hulks of warships sunk too close inshore because	the work involved setting off nerve-shattering blasts at all hours.	5.304976573626288
15824. tommy	was interested in psychiatry because there was much an understanding	nurse could do to help the patients.	7.368193112759449
15825. but she suffered in	her	off-duty hours.	15.145152070227198
15826. such as now when she sat at a table in the coffee shop	at the officers' club having coffee and a hamburger to sustain	her until dinnertime.	6.384377363341759
15827. she had changed into a cocktail dress and the	whole evening should have been before her but already she was beginning	to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck.	6.399294661886543
15828. this was one of the navy's	crossroads- you find them all around the world.	14.22699534026061
15829. ships from	the west coast rotated on six-month tours of duty with the seventh	fleet and yokosuka was the seventh fleet's principal port for	maintenance upkeep and shore liberty.	4.726707772215755
15830. sooner or later all the gray	navy ships came in here; if tommy sat long enough she would be sure	to see all the young officers she had met in san diego and long	beach.	6.2633412556462735
15831. and she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back	there.	8.231448570688828
15832. she felt rather than saw the approach of the good-looking	young man.	10.998084909713464
15833. he came through from the fleet bar which was stag	with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he carried.	6.145988127799061
15834. when he saw tommy	sitting alone the tinkling sound stopped.	14.010139104510168
15835. he was perhaps a trifle	tipsy having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted and consequently	out of practice; he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously	tailored in hong kong and he was of an age that marked him as	a lieutenant.	5.858576456411803
15836. probably off one of the carriers- an aviator.	12.22743205244182
15837. there	was a fifty-fifty chance perhaps that he would be unmarried and an	even more slender chance that his approach would be different.	6.3846635821707585
15838. japan	did something to a man- and it wasn't just japan either because	the same thing applied anywhere overseas.	6.643215071337043
15839. it was as if foreign duty	implied and excused license; it intimated that the folks at home would	never know about it and therefore why not?	6.698250562303125
15840.    then the young	man in the brown sports jacket spoke and it was no different.	10.730496427106432
15841. harro girl-san! he said turning on what was meant to be	charm.	6.355566126734525
15842. you catchee boy-furiendo?	24.616003681853215
15843.  maybe you likee date with me?	11.035848993798473
15844. 	i beg your pardon! tommy said out of her cold	rage.	7.879513779734377
15845. i don't believe i know you and i can't understand your	quaint brand of english- it was meant to be english wasn't	it?	4.785738768063801
15846.    the nice-looking young officer fell back on his heels	open-mouthed and blushing.	9.41193055654976
15847. at least he had the decency to blush	she thought.	11.205230233571179
15848. oh- i'm sorry! you see i thought-	i mean i really had no idea-   oh yes- you had ideas!	tommy interrupted furiously.	6.365727389270327
15849. all wrong ones! then she	jerked her thumb toward the door in a very american gesture and dropped	into navy slang.	6.061948138598955
15850. take off fly-boy!   uh-	sorry! he muttered and took off obviously feeling like a fool.	8.409241098231298
15851. the trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for tommy.	9.92274729638731
15852. she felt like a fool too.	12.671390746668923
15853. it hadn't been this way in	college or in nurses' training; it wasn't this way in the hospital	at san diego.	7.262370556055022
15854. everybody had accepted her for what she was- a	very charming girl.	9.135642586896282
15855. nobody had addressed her in broken english at any	of those places nobody had suggested that she wasn't american.	5.6013619292891415
15856. there are spanish girls who look like tommy momoyama brunettes with	a moorish hint of the orient in their faces; there are beauties	from the balkan states who are similarly endowed and- back in the	blessed united states- they were regarded simply as pretty women.	6.90520284976561
15857. now having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not	asked for tommy was being humiliated at every turn.	6.168936002855832
15858. four little japanese waitresses were murdering	the english language at the counter- yuki kobayashi happened	to be one of them.	8.177551099604287
15859. everybody but tommy seemed to think it was charming	when they called bifutek-san! for a steak sandwich or	kohi futotsu! for one cup of coffee.	5.493240172889332
15860. two other japanese girls	were sitting at the tables both quite pretty and well groomed.	8.859019478325889
15861. one	was with a whitehaired and doting lieutenant commander; the other	was with her american husband and their exceptionally appealing children.	5.083242045036259
15862. seeing these did nothing for tommy's mood.	9.246940238563527
15863. she told herself	rebelliously and with pride i am an american!   and	so she was and would remain.	6.343404332241981
15864. but she was learning that so long as she	was in this country and wore civilian dress in the club there would	always be transient young men who would approach her with broken english.	8.645151097851084
15865. there had been occasions when some of the more experienced had	even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good japanese.	9.80362349344151
15866. tommy wouldn't know; after coming to america her parents had spoken	only english.	7.391013650626644
15867. one thing was becoming increasingly sure.	13.86589361258331
15868. she had been sent to the wrong place for duty.	16.632966839099623
15869. there was more to service	in the navy nurse corps than the hours in the ward.	9.0631147286475
15870. one had	to have friends and a congenial life in after-duty hours h.	9.09009021154316
15871. now there was raucous male singing from the fleet bar.	7.985597543376973
15872. it was terribly	off key and poorly done and tommy could never admit to herself	that male companionship was a very natural and important thing but all	at once she felt lonesome and put-upon.	7.405793528207137
15873. she finished her hamburger	and drank her coffee and paid her check; she got out of the coffee	shop before the incident could be repeated.	5.818155896055428
15874. eating while angry had given	her a slight indigestion.	8.581436094141479
15875. back in her living quarters at the hospital	she took bicarbonate of soda and sulked.	6.636794034768505
15876. then after a while	she went to her mirror.	10.813121632821906
15877. she certainly looked	japanese and perhaps she could not really blame the young men.	7.008507738042025
15878. and	still they did not have to be so crude in their approach h.	13.075630510259407
15879. there was a letter to write to her mother and she tried to make its	tone cheerful.	10.622025161006475
15880. she promised that she would soon take a few day's leave	and visit the uncle she had never seen on the island of oyajima-	which was not very far from yokusuka.	7.529594850528758
15881. and tomorrow she would take	time to shop for the kimono her mother wanted to present to the young	wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown.	6.8038316638634555
15882. tommy of course	had never heard of a kotowaza or japanese proverb which says tanin	yori miuchi and is literally translated as relatives are	better than strangers.	6.510961375784369
15883. actually this is only another way	of saying that blood is thicker than water.	6.729643282152829
15884. doc doolittle's	scheduled appearance at captain's mast was a very unusual thing	because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young	and immature and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report.	5.873190580420362
15885. but the beer hall riot in subic had been unusual too and walt perry	was convinced that doc had started it through some expert tactics	in rabble rousing.	5.717878709008596
15886. just why anybody should wish to start a riot the	executive officer didn't know.	8.890964308847137
15887. in his opinion doc had not grown	up.	11.575746058401313
15888. the lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief.	10.35355298675256
15889. there	had never been a good reason for doc doolittle to grow up.	6.11899076307319
15890. he had	come into the navy too young with the image of the fun-loving guns	appleby before him.	10.377433810376445
15891. the war found him much too early and its perils-	and especially its awful boredom- were best forgotten in horseplay	and elaborate practical jokes and even now doc had never found	any stabilizing sobering influence.	5.168621342964303
15892. he remained young at heart with	an overdeveloped sense of humor.	10.508315604512694
15893. he wisecracked about the captain's	indoctrination of new men took great delight in slaughtering cockroaches	with ethyl chloride and gave no thought for tomorrow.	5.602141262886529
15894. he was doing	thirty years and the navy would take care of him.	13.345395884151657
15895. the job security	enjoyed by doc doolittle and nearly all members of the armed	forces is a wonderful thing.	8.294743648082896
15896. actually all a man in uniform has to	do is to get by.	10.863276070298907
15897. he may not rise to the heights but he can get by and	eventually be retired.	7.944838366322429
15898. doc had been under restriction to the	ship since the bustard left subic.	8.161681441555755
15899. this deprived him of liberty	in hong kong but he told boats mccafferty that hong kong was	a book he had read before and the navy would always bring him there	again some day.	5.084134761784884
15900. at yokosuka he was restricted to the confines of	the base because walt perry being thoughtful knew that doc might	have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the supply	base.	6.951738840703637
15901. this gave doc the whole range of the naval establishment and	suited him quite well.	8.41326280401605
15902. there were two things he wanted to do: inspect	one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the naval	base and visit an old shipmate.	9.200072043288522
15903. a telephone line had been	hooked up to connect the ship with the base exchange.	6.211372457527363
15904. after supper	doc called whitey gresham who was now a lieutenant and had a family.	8.269770199313292
15905. well doc you old sonofabitch! whitey exclaimed	with true affection.	7.679813597575823
15906. come over and have a drink.	12.009831831331551
15907. we live down by	the base commissary.	13.058717977943918
15908. i'll be there but	i'll walk doc said.	5.994717221457542
15909. i've got to run an errand on the	way.	4.5256324080886206
15910. see you in about an hour.	12.507185654137091
15911. he threw a smart salute at	the gangway went up the dock and turned down the wide street in front	of the petty officers' club.	5.7194515244795605
15912. how he wondered does one enjoy one's spare time?	9.981564148579817
15913.  he considered	some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from	dawn to dusk.	10.967830180715552
15914. then there was exercise boating and hiking which was	not only good for you but also made you more virile: the thought	of strenuous activity left him exhausted.	8.038741941496259
15915. perhaps golf with a fashionable	companion- but he'd lost his clubs hadn't played in years.	6.670255303873661
15916. there was swimming over at the riverside hotel but his skin was	so white he looked like the bottom of a frog.	10.648352261644632
15917. perhaps a packing trip	into the sierras let his beard grow- but that was too stark.	7.055556848958326
15918. i could	he thought take a long walk- but where?	11.664911033320324
15919.    the telephone	rang.	18.69259083039617
15920. you missed it buzz's voice said you should	have gone over to the pagan room with us.	9.273802439647252
15921. strippers but	scrumptious and toodle williams and her all-lesbian band.	6.460370037324521
15922. i went over to the willows and dropped	two notes.	12.601286690977014
15923. tough buzz said listen we're	having a stag dinner over at the pagan room on friday.	5.716688447118552
15924. imagine	a stag dinner with toodle williams.	9.670406878971576
15925. owen wanted to be pleasant because buzz worked the territory next	to his but he hadn't come to reno for stag dinners.	5.374204152059324
15926. thanks	owen said but friday is a long way off and anything can happen.	9.123777562124285
15927. buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims	rest.	6.210871206873012
15928. when owen was finally rid of him there was a timid rap at the	door.	9.371414928673117
15929. yes?	15.610129252044759
15930.    i'm	mrs gertrude parker a soft voice explained and i'd	like to talk to you for a few minutes please.	8.679790462525656
15931. ahah he	thought a lush divorcee at last.	7.14162538120728
15932. probably saw me in the lobby.	11.628487797146096
15933. he	was disappointed to find a nervous scrawny woman with a big hat standing	at the door.	6.389141752389197
15934. she frowned at his green pajamas with the yellow moons.	9.906434141394781
15935. how do you do?	17.058897260570216
15936.  she said semi-professionally.	26.414276061460168
15937. our	church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in alaska.	6.573180959419074
15938. we call them lay-sisters and they go among the eskimos making friends	and bringing the light.	8.238985976552454
15939. they're up there in that freezing climate	and all of us have to try and help them.	4.394510251306357
15940. oh?	19.804021762487697
15941. 	you see she said looking past him into the room where	the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light you and i	can't understand the many hardships they have to undergo.	5.1179481506618405
15942. why is that?	21.525366789347345
15943.    she apparently wasn't satisfied with	his reaction.	9.987973641461945
15944. smug owen thought smug and sappy.	9.670406878971576
15945. there was a slight	nervous twitch in the region of her left eye.	12.427847110063073
15946. it gave her a lewd winking	effect.	18.031434947663
15947. have you ever tried to reason with an eskimo?	11.312750966039447
15948. 	she asked winking wildly.	11.568363037656766
15949. they are a very difficult group	of people.	11.952114519686964
15950. i don't know much about them owen admitted	but i suppose they have their own religion and they probably	resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not	to do.	5.562008416313772
15951. she smiled in a sickly-tolerant fashion.	9.987973641461945
15952. you know	that's very interesting.	20.025453829488345
15953. people don't know how much they give	away about themselves by remarks like that.	6.73794973382098
15954. the more canvassing i do	the more i note how far most people are from their personal god.	8.336858684965762
15955. forebearing owen kept his peace.	8.254441635698543
15956. what would happen next?	19.98229444449758
15957. 	that she was out for a touch was certain but when did she get to the	pitch?	5.566806497763548
15958.  several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly	retreated trying to close the door a little and she slowly leaned toward	him and raised her voice.	6.7819939382968855
15959. how did you get by the desk?	10.592111193431219
15960. 	he asked curiously.	13.148092146312546
15961. i'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're	wandering around the corridors knocking on strangers' doors and	talking down eskimos.	3.8666326542850724
15962. oh i just come once a week.	10.398550832016166
15963. every day i visit a different hotel.	7.937963995876646
15964. i feel it's my duty.	18.14271946320536
15965. i do this	work all on my own because i understand the difficulties and i	want to help these lay-sisters.	7.448943343816053
15966. do you know these women go all through	alaska and they don't have the proper facilities?	6.794550777559964
15967.  they travel	in pairs as much as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day.	9.474041137097496
15968. do	you have any idea how far i travel every day?	8.685200836214921
15969.  i have the whole pacific	northwest.	19.796534093458984
15970. owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he	couldn't help himself.	7.92643863302705
15971. mrs gertrude parker drew back.	9.723374094021814
15972. that's hardly a christian approach she remonstrated.	5.057456522133471
15973. you're	in the secular world.	9.118533821976325
15974. i didn't say it was christian.	9.398156584756887
15975. i don't think you'll find many active christian salesmen.	4.733174593885167
15976. not that religion isn't big business; those bibles and prayer books	make a lot of money for publishing houses but they don't get top	personnel.	8.60172568666572
15977. our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics.	7.4609952380312565
15978. god i take it plays no part in this she said waspishly.	10.35569607594973
15979. god doesn't have any appliance or cosmetics he said	heatedly before he caught himself.	6.437439750364002
15980. it sounded silly; why go on?	16.49084636425047
15981. 	more people were passing; he had to find some way to close this impossible	conversation.	6.305189858899902
15982. and whiskey she said smiling and	blinking at the highball glasses.	9.73086604464448
15983. don't forget whiskey; it's	such a big seller.	3.1547441118478337
15984. you know he said getting a grip	on himself i think you're going to have to excuse me.	11.089208013672843
15985. i can imagine she said.	16.265699422050396
15986. probably	down at the bar.	11.568363037656766
15987. but what do you want to do about the lay-sisters?	18.8550949936891
15988. 	they must be freezing up there now.	9.060328853487057
15989. can't you help them?	9.118533821976325
15990. 	leave a card or something.	10.472119682746735
15991. i	have no card she said bitterly.	8.309587635189425
15992. you haven't been listening	to what i've been telling you.	11.48832940527018
15993. i only hope my talking to you has	helped you a little anyway because you need spiritual bucking-up.	6.422715021685593
15994. she looked crestfallen as if he had somehow disappointed the whole	human race.	11.870732582270533
15995. she stood indecisively for a moment then walked down	the hall; he heard her knocking on another door.	6.8025228002366545
15996. it took him	about fifteen minutes to calm himself; then he realized he was hungry.	10.315842221009856
15997. he showered shaved dressed and went down to the dining room for	breakfast.	11.603209886925374
15998. on the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail.	14.315829117055964
15999. there	was a check from his company and the usual enthusiastic bulletins	on new lines they always issued.	6.383583212744386
16000. his lawyer had sent him a statement	on his overdue alimony and there was a letter from the collector	of internal revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last	year's exemptions.	8.225236904384568
16001. he ate breakfast in a sullen mood but	afterwards when he walked out onto virginia street he felt braced.	6.034462242787552
16002. he looked off to the crest of the sierras still white-topped; the	glisten of the truckee river made a wide spangle.	7.763709117059294
16003. he felt suddenly	elated adventurous.	16.792167399765805
16004. with any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot.	9.353719599580794
16005. although it was only three o'clock he stopped in	at the golden calf.	9.405942280467238
16006. the tables were all spinning the dice rattling	the bar crowded.	9.652754872136947
16007. just to test himself he played roulette for quarters	on his old combination five and seventeen and within an hour he	had won surprisingly twenty dollars.	5.669781138034007
16008. the way was opening up; when	the management brought around champagne the breakfast settled its	whirling around in his stomach.	8.354956021322465
16009. the golden calf was dimly lit	with shaded neon.	8.341215694113531
16010. there were more women than men in the place but	he couldn't find a flowerpot.	13.298217676188932
16011. they all had the hard look of gamblers	who had stopped dreaming who automatically turned the cards hardly	caring what showed up.	5.901367588821705
16012. the mural around the wall depicted early settlers	in covered wagons who appeared much more animated than the gamblers.	7.333060553020843
16013. the women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from	the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance while the men were	stern but hopeful.	5.694065682367101
16014. all of course except the donner party who were	bent on starving to death.	10.453913760301141
16015. i wonder if they did eat each	other at the end owen mused.	13.10522769428326
16016. he sat down next to a heavily-upholstered	blonde but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes.	8.407523987820325
16017. she	sighed a dirty word and left.	7.622507342753323
16018. owen was surprised to see mrs gertrude	parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged	by the entrance.	6.643215071337043
16019. she sat down and played two slots at once looking grim	as if bested by mechanical devices and owen felt sorry for the	lay-sisters depending on her support.	5.172318560596036
16020. a dried-up cowboy sat down	next to him in the blonde's place.	11.80967412168574
16021. he was a little more authentic	than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables.	10.061622312770144
16022. what you	need is a steady martingale the cowboy announced after watching owen	play.	8.946197657137652
16023. you can't build on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen.	6.485240293948885
16024. what are you playing?	27.170418025661107
16025.  owen asked.	12.292407525564322
16026. i'm	just logging the cowboy explained.	10.472119682746735
16027. i keep all these plays in this	little black book and i watch over a twelve-hour period to find	out what numbers are repeating.	5.643008810714759
16028. but roulette's not my game.	16.181449055670814
16029. i'm	always	trying to find a breaking table in blackjack.	7.740380523951136
16030. incidentally i'm	pretty famous in these parts: i'm called the wrangler.	8.380540047857194
16031. don't you have to spend any time on your	ranch?	4.28927880519753
16032.    well of course i do.	17.78420981258574
16033. i'm with the	bar-h	pushing a horse called sparky.	4.0028807404405535
16034. he's my own horse and what	i collect from him i use on blackjack.	5.014063307014853
16035. this sparky can rack and single-foot	and he's the fastest thing in washoe county.	6.70376850576318
16036. i figure if	i can get any kind of publicity campaign going i'll land him on	tv- you know one of those favorite horses for some western hero.	7.605495650846075
16037. i once trained a horse for hoot gibson but nothing like sparky.	7.6623752613818805
16038. he's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully.	5.180848938002438
16039. five came	up while owen was listening to the wrangler and he neglected to	play a loss of ten dollars.	5.710215321207888
16040. this proved conclusively that the wrangler	was a jinx so he walked on down to hurrays an even more glorified	gambling den than the golden calf.	7.218234956809942
16041. when he looked in the back	mrs gertrude parker was marking keno cards.	8.56294043647447
16042. his adventurous	spirit had waned; he studied the pistol exhibition that hurrays	featured as an added attraction.	7.681460231045325
16043. he ogled a long redhead with green	eyes but she was a shill with her money in front of her.	7.209524612603879
16044. he had no	great	prejudice against shills; it just seemed such a dry run.	10.584718158349082
16045. there was no cash around; everyone was flipping silver dollars.	12.87996220540548
16046. the	management discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave	the customers chips or checks or premium points.	6.54093796655646
16047. he read a special	announcement whereby hurrays would feature a special floorshow at three	am starring adele brenner and fourteen glamorous	schoolgirls.	5.909009505545415
16048. he wondered if he might bag a tourist but	they looked frightened of him.	8.824820353737188
16049. he passed two brides both wearing orchids	and they made him feel a little sad.	6.718491433348979
16050. owen found buzz watching	chuck-a-luck.	11.568363037656766
16051. buzz had on a hawaiian shirt and was carrying some	sun-tan oil and dark glasses.	5.542917982132687
16052. he was shorter and fatter than owen	who felt good standing next to him.	10.107316701574787
16053. we're all going over to lake	tahoe and try our luck at cal-neva buzz explained still	instigating.	4.598937419623819
16054. we ran into a guy at the pagan room who guarantees	we can beat the wheel.	9.118770590855933
16055. he started out as a stickman then became a pit	boss until the club found him crossroading.	6.612575729858568
16056. he was knocking down checks	at faro.	17.218119440805356
16057. i'm allergic to tahoe owen explained.	4.0320972279153615
16058. well okay buzz	said.	18.126823107132473
16059. we'll see you around later.	4.830320705807231
16060. owen went over to	the crap table and the dice were hot but he couldn't pyramid with	any consecutive success.	6.54093796655646
16061. how's your luck honey?	9.118533821976325
16062.  a	short platinum blonde in a bursting sun-suit addressed him.	8.196044167676531
16063. she looked	well-fed and prosperous but he didn't get the impression he was being	propositioned the way he'd been hoping.	5.829716951732311
16064. i haven't	had any luck since i was a baby.	13.186025328507746
16065. stake me she said	and let me at those dice.	6.460370037324521
16066. i'll make them dance the tango.	6.139485272299999
16067. we'll	get it in a hurry and get it out.	7.409108477346306
16068. let's have a drink	and discuss a merger.	7.79036137790862
16069. if you go broke she said smiling	up at him i'll leave you.	9.544673152130013
16070. sounds like real	love owen said.	10.821404680402274
16071. it sort of brings a lump to my throat.	9.740106390825309
16072. my name's gisele the blonde said after she ordered a	scotch.	8.5969447579045
16073. my mother wanted to call me sylphide	but it sounded too affected.	6.849756847411504
16074. is there any word you would like	to offer in your own defense?	12.682020689210686
16075.    spencer shook his head.	9.118533821976325
16076. alexander said answer me properly spencer.	9.880450305558641
16077. spencer	was quiet for a moment longer then he said there is nothing	i want to say captain.	6.509921326966923
16078. naval procedure he thought had its moments of grim humor.	8.392032887190927
16079. philip spencer had cold-bloodedly planned the murder of his captain	yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of proper address.	5.673310619297785
16080. during the morning hours it became clear that the arrest of	spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the somers.	11.001699833989331
16081. those named in the greek paper were manufacturing reasons to steal	aft under pretence of some call of duty so as to be near spencer watching	an opportunity to communicate with him.	5.769484271584444
16082. hostile glances were	flashed at both alexander and gansevoort.	8.581436094141479
16083. the two met in the captain's	cabin.	12.456360443626929
16084. what is the next step captain?	21.61264495657293
16085. 	more arrests i fear.	9.118533821976325
16086. in your opinion who is this e	andrews on the 'certain' list?	10.29102930228358
16087.    cromwell of course.	10.363724110347151
16088. he is the oldest and most experienced of the lot.	16.790591681806706
16089. he saw the dangers	not the glories of being identified as a mutineer.	8.750133457414403
16090. somehow he	talked spencer into letting him use another name.	8.802222896711074
16091. there was	a tap at the door and oliver entered with the word that heiser wished	to see the captain.	7.721332141691359
16092. heiser	breathless and wild-eyed brought the chilling news that the handspikes	heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their	customary places.	6.708501221690429
16093. and also sir two articles which were considered	souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely.	6.174474194488761
16094. an	african knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by mckinley	and green.	8.071298982496305
16095. mckinley was overheard to say that he would like	to get the knife into spencer's possession and that-	where did you gather all this information heiser?	5.940254971693728
16096.  who reported	to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who-	he was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the	ladder with gansevoort and heiser behind him.	6.340692788420991
16097. a glance revealed	that the main topgallant mast had been carried away.	6.881248562988826
16098. the aimless milling	about of what had been a well-trained well-organized crew struck	alexander with horror.	9.696025291664574
16099. he bellowed orders and watched the alert response	of some of his men and watched too the way a dozen or more turned	their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for	further instruction.	5.307351523960715
16100. adrien deslonde hastened to alexander's	side.	10.472119682746735
16101. small violently jerked the weather-royal brace with full	intention to carry away the mast.	6.0337199299702675
16102. i saw him myself and it was done after	consultation with cromwell.	13.151757506541987
16103. and it was	clear that adrien was not mistaken for both small and cromwell	took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast	till philip spencer had given the signal to obey.	5.711868436746043
16104. then with disappointment	evident upon their faces they moved to the work.	10.015371846802845
16105. alexander	guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil thinking it the	ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed.	6.884305219303425
16106. their strategy	was sound enough and he reasoned had been defeated only by philip	spencer's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated.	6.7307444137307515
16107. when the mast was raised alexander gave the order for small	and cromwell to be placed under arrest and now three figures in irons	sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the somers.	5.513580587153346
16108. spencer's potential followers were openly sullen and morose missing	muster without excuse expressing in ominous tones their displeasure	at the prisoners being kept in irons communicating with the three	by glance and signal.	5.830388127029086
16109. one of the missing handspikes came out of its	hiding place after midshipman tillotson had been insolently disobeyed	by seaman wilson.	9.077918260472366
16110. tillotson had reported the man to gansevoort	and an hour later with back turned had been attacked by wilson brandishing	the weapon.	6.619226042532854
16111. wilson shackled and snarling was thrown with the	other prisoners and was soon joined by green mckee and mckinley.	5.15576524365156
16112. not a man on the brig loyal or villainous could be unaffected by	the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny.	8.29807668759856
16113. in the	tiny cabin alexander met with gansevoort heiser and wales to	speak and to listen.	6.869006664561913
16114. three days had passed since spencer's arrest	and each day had brought new dangers new fears.	7.409784756424648
16115. gansevoort said	it requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we	can now rely.	5.326519577128725
16116. to have the greek paper is not the great help that at	first flush it seemed.	10.947280409894654
16117. from actions aboard it is easy to guess that	spencer's boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate.	7.480892903909651
16118. well heiser ventured why don't we hold an investigation	with questioning and-   that would be worse	than useless alexander broke in.	7.692169362796583
16119. there is not space to hold	or force to guard any increased number of prisoners.	10.768486411043197
16120. besides suppose	we hold a court of inquiry then what?	9.124108240509631
16121.  then we have informed a large	number of our crew that when they reach the united states they will	be punished but that in the meanwhile they may run loose and are	expected to perform their jobs in good order.	5.933976738932503
16122. mr heiser does this	sound like a truly workable plan to you?	8.75775410472422
16123.  do you not think these men	might choose the black flag here and now?	7.9950544362427705
16124.    wales said	of	course they would.	11.568363037656766
16125. they are about to do so at any moment as it	is.	13.557139676197243
16126. all that is needed is for one man to feel self-confident enough to	take the lead.	9.316521284051241
16127. as soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the	others or by a signal from spencer we are going to be rushed.	7.514388962691809
16128. we	are going to be rushed and murdered.	10.881601532442618
16129. that is extravagant	language mr wales.	15.596825044459875
16130. we are not going to be rushed and murdered	alexander said.	21.87464405261163
16131. we are going to bring the somers into new	york harbor safe and sound.	9.922768750647368
16132. of course i agree with	the captain gansevoort said thoughtfully but the conspiracy	is ferocious and desperate.	10.678637679099863
16133. the instinct of discipline has been lost.	8.976097203071156
16134. anything is possible when anarchy has the upper hand.	8.196044167676531
16135. he paused	then added everything on a ship is a weapon.	7.953394054598466
16136. implements of wood	and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where	a man stands.	6.757567981697296
16137. and we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many.	7.395600886732694
16138. we ourselves must stand sentinel.	16.08227483512138
16139. under arms day and night watch and watch about.	8.346384221294395
16140. those of us present	the perry brothers deslonde and the other midshipmen now have	the responsibility of the somers.	10.506140045503416
16141. a great deal of labor we have	as well for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed.	7.82753896637211
16142. and when he was alone again in the cabin alexander lowered his	head into his arms and wept for he knew full well what must be done	what in the end would be done.	8.200503306327501
16143. with all his heart he had loved the navy	and now he must act in accordance with the navy's implacable laws.	7.749017875623414
16144. and when he did when he gave to his ship that protection necessary	to preserve her honor he knew he would lose forever the navy to	which he had dedicated his soul.	8.045272115116706
16145. where had he failed?	11.992927780254675
16146.  how	had he failed?	13.148092146312546
16147.  he who had tried so hard who had yearned so passionately	to be a great officer.	7.440868350706642
16148. it came to him as he wept there aboard the	somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek	to storm the gates of heaven.	7.84482703407234
16149. it was given or it was not given.	15.773022186284088
16150. one	did one's best and if fortune smiled there was a reward.	8.510712871262166
16151. one did	one's best and if fortune frowned an eighteen-year-old boy with murder	in his heart sailed aboard one's ship.	5.993063898680357
16152. and alexander sobbed	like a girl for the dreams he had had and he felt no shame.	7.833338170698159
16153. god knew	his tears were his to shed if he so desired for it had not been with	an egotist's rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career.	5.952272437249133
16154. another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist.	8.19431892800833
16155. it	was for love that he had served the navy.	8.239776694938588
16156. to have someday that love	returned was what he had lived for.	11.24865548690165
16157. now the hope was gone.	13.126995623141552
16158. yes he	would bring the somers safely into new york harbor but at a price.	7.868276295812619
16159. dear god at what a price.	7.782435221260237
16160. and after a while he dried	his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and	dignity.	8.293971518800271
16161. stern-faced he inspected the prisoners satisfying himself	that they were clean well fed and comfortable within reason.	5.326519577128725
16162. the prisoners	averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger.	9.055676704058166
16163. only cromwell the giant boatswain was mild-mannered and respectful.	7.796565768573885
16164. he said captain may i speak please?	17.04255706974967
16165.  captain	i am innocent of any plot against you or the ship.	6.002446559592496
16166. are	you cromwell?	18.007491315085424
16167.    yes sir.	17.219467236792656
16168. before god i swear i am	innocent.	12.358689619728056
16169. i know nothing of any plot if there is such a thing.	10.487121406856064
16170. you are the only man aboard who can be in doubt.	12.955366788350002
16171. i cannot speak for others sir but i am innocent.	9.866426817028776
16172. he leaned	closer to alexander squinting up at him from the deck.	10.828783456755367
16173. surely captain	you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything.	5.74964531324679
16174. no cromwell i did not find your name.	12.024054770489268
16175. you were careful	about that.	15.784668708114987
16176. now spencer seeming with effort to shake	himself from lethargy spoke.	9.266626149434723
16177. he said cromwell is telling you the	truth.	13.433459215241902
16178. alexander shifted his gaze to spencer.	9.880450305558641
16179. the calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness	of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend	cromwell.	6.088429261520914
16180. alexander knew spencer too well to think him nai^ve or	thick-skulled.	8.001384252874109
16181. and in a sudden wave of painful clarity alexander recognized	a kinship with spencer.	8.905984773826017
16182. here was another human who understood	the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable.	10.934940070885343
16183. there was good fortune	and there was bad and philip spencer in handcuffs and ankle irons	knew it to be a truth.	8.506507165152941
16184. he expected nothing for himself but that	which naturally follows those marked for misfortune.	9.335583858039387
16185. the red-haired	captain towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority	was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon philip spencer.	6.145312606246718
16186. this tragic lad had forged his own shackles.	10.867675364171879
16187. but he could not	have done so could not have found the way had fortune favored him.	8.398800696097702
16188. and because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the red-haired	captain they would be each other's undoing.	8.333857443819698
16189. spencer	if there is guilt if you do not deny your own how is it possible for	cromwell to be innocent?	5.52461462673258
16190.  he was your constant companion.	19.87986593677342
16191. the hazel eyes met alexander's.	10.915477388587384
16192. i tell you he is innocent.	14.503132517204426
16193. and do you think there is a reason why i should accept	your word?	8.351847965062083
16194.    yes.	19.804021762487697
16195. i have nothing to gain by defending cromwell.	12.447724118384695
16196. nothing to lose either spencer.	12.339849216329831
16197. that's	true spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation.	6.460370037324521
16198. his eyes went back to contemplation of the sea.	10.445085257007582
16199. i	am innocent captain cromwell said again.	8.309587635189425
16200. before god captain	i am innocent.	13.7530392924994
16201. and though it was logical that a man	who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth still	it was difficult to understand why spencer spoke only for cromwell.	5.705602362868318
16202. the boatswain was as guilty as any.	11.387658710676023
16203. no action of his could be interpreted	in his favor and four midshipmen prior to their knowing the	significance of the greek paper had seen it in cromwell's hands	while spencer whispered explanations.	5.349365758343681
16204. i thought midshipman	rogers had told alexander that spencer was teaching him	geometry.	10.3211144282129
16205. it was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles	to the wardroom where a class of apprentices awaited him.	6.97275256037792
16206. this	was a training ship and the training would continue but there was an	element of frightful absurdity here which alexander recognized.	7.221347625129147
16207. some	of these apprentices were in physical strength already men and doubtless	a percentage of them were spencer's followers.	5.944006866220232
16208. rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to	study the torah.	7.032105024464237
16209. bits of trash lay in the roadway.	7.829578875320732
16210. the air smelled	warmish and foul.	16.94381787073161
16211. a young man appeared out of a side alley and	walked toward us with quick strides.	8.027237872659333
16212. he wore a long double-breasted	coat of a heavy material dark trousers and black boots with buckles.	8.987054866156832
16213. his black hat with its wide brim high crown and fur trim rode high.	5.986320865341358
16214. with his head erect he approached not glancing at us and passed	by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead.	7.425727860858874
16215. he had a pinkish-white	complexion a small straight nose a short black beard and	tightly curled paot.	7.975950725851296
16216. i was suddenly conscious of my bare arms.	13.53487361518177
16217. the	girls in the market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered their	legs with cloth stockings.	6.4692013143014755
16218. i turned and watched him stride down the	center of the road.	10.666942129071304
16219. his hands were swinging at his sides and he passed	through the dingy market place with his back straight and pivoting	on his heel he entered an old stone building.	4.938136177850053
16220. rachel had seen	me watching the young man.	9.060328853487057
16221. when your mother was here	he must have been a young boy.	9.377836845689659
16222. like the ones you will see now.	12.833273346968479
16223. i swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside	rachel.	8.072525893110939
16224. she led me into a twisting side alley.	10.749202706058774
16225. the dirty discolored	buildings looked boarded up and their few windows stood high above	our heads.	6.374057384651866
16226. rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most	of the buildings.	7.879513779734377
16227. we entered one where the front door stood ajar and	climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor.	5.8950234212887205
16228. an old man with a	white beard and dressed in a long shabby coat baggy trousers and a	black skullcap greeted us.	7.943630902859154
16229. he nodded clasping	and unclasping his hands over his paunch and flicked glances at me.	6.718491433348979
16230. i thought he would ask us to leave because rachel and i were bare-armed	but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor.	8.321958005169543
16231. his toes pointed out toward the walls.	8.100034263261762
16232. he stopped in front of a	door placed a finger on his lips and still peering down into his beard	pushed open the door to a classroom.	9.708536034140854
16233. he left	us.	21.889553134177078
16234. little boys crowded together on long wooden benches and	in the center of the room sat the teacher.	10.408843607623785
16235. his black beard dripped down	over the front of his coat.	8.120679696213472
16236. one white hand poised a stick above his	desk.	11.30782011568669
16237. he turned his surly half-closed eyes toward us stared for	a second then shouted in yiddish one two three! rapping	the stick against the desk.	5.825115699728593
16238. the little boys shrilled out a yiddish translation	or interpretation of the five books of moses which they	had previously chanted in hebrew.	8.274865032182026
16239. they chanted a fixed tune in time	to the report of the stick.	8.623328031800257
16240. each boy opened his small mouth wide and	rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and	great-grandfather	had studied and prayed in the ghettos of europe.	7.49098353977564
16241. they had large bright eyes the small upturned noses	of all babies everywhere and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets	of paot framing their little white faces.	6.174953366354887
16242. they bent over	yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher.	10.49261494877158
16243. since they	did not glance curiously at us once i guessed that there was a penalty	for distraction.	7.335895909855692
16244. the guttural language from the ghetto stopped.	11.387658710676023
16245. the teacher plunged the children into a new portion this time in hebrew	rapping the stick incessantly.	6.26128198238476
16246. one boy who rocked back	and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and freckles.	8.252736515403623
16247. his tightly	curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders.	7.18676379039501
16248. in the center	of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap.	11.568103455632714
16249. his head barely	rose above the table.	8.755009490035256
16250. i stared at him for a long time.	14.078909837116544
16251. he did not return	my interest.	20.330024155874902
16252. my eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the	one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the	boys.	6.442564647997967
16253. some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the	words long ago.	9.572166443885843
16254. they singsonged the portion at the teacher who accompanied	them in an off-key baritone and spurred them on with the stick.	7.231737476099396
16255. the tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake.	8.410827486322589
16256. i could	not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair.	10.403408460010127
16257. his body pitched	back and forth on the bench.	8.222033112066317
16258. his front teeth were missing.	12.214555706636531
16259. i	shuddered and backed out of the room.	8.71470926500631
16260. rachel followed looked at me	and clucked with her tongue.	8.196044167676531
16261. we walked down the cool hall silently.	12.24641875226162
16262. from behind us came the rapping of the stick and the high-pitched voices	of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and	prayer.	6.707812590523808
16263. i said how long do they keep that up?	8.555241096529764
16264. 	all day she said.	11.568363037656766
16265. except for shabbat when they are praying	all day.	12.654155661336048
16266. i rubbed my hands together.	15.711603260075847
16267. they had turned	numb and prickly in the classroom.	10.388333405965094
16268. the old man in the baggy clothes	waited at the foot of the steps.	13.102497140223713
16269. he glanced down into his beard and	muttered something in yiddish.	7.953394054598466
16270. rachel said he asks for money.	9.670406878971576
16271. i reached into the pocket of my skirt	fingered ten pruta and dropped the coin.	6.789400154986115
16272. then i picked it up	again and handed it to the old man.	13.314349989229221
16273. i didn't look at	him.	8.798779312104406
16274. does this bother you?	21.428618075818264
16275.  i	said.	15.610129252044759
16276. most of our sabras think it's	horrible.	20.384487306008143
16277. when we were fighting a few of our orthodox people were	lying down in the roads so we could not pass.	8.509470265114581
16278. they said that we must	not fight but wait for the messiah.	9.33913350279515
16279. you	had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and	appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home.	5.676598160931665
16280. you had to be stupid or crazy or immortal.	14.547825184934224
16281. i was	american.	22.589978126100267
16282. you had to know also that you were going to fail.	13.759234804827997
16283. all	of it might have been heroic but they had done it in the wrong place.	9.156388397584864
16284. rachel faced me.	13.148092146312546
16285. her bright eyes were twinkling.	9.707775903539014
16286. she said sometimes i think they are keeping religion for	us while we play around.	9.490302606544288
16287. your mother hated this way of life.	8.667521764169805
16288. she	wished to change much for the children here.	10.425849346550901
16289. i said quietly	respectfully what did she do here?	9.169644675936961
16290.  in this section?	31.63770645184257
16291. 	rachel	clicked her tongue behind her teeth.	7.622507342753323
16292. but when	she saw the children you have just visited she wanted to take them away	and put them out in the country in the kibbutzim.	9.928165435492799
16293. she was a strange woman your mother.	13.064989863869101
16294. when she loved it was	with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those	things she loved.	8.054001493679612
16295. nothing was too impossible for her to do when she	wanted.	7.173315565076554
16296. she stayed here to work for aliah.	13.668721625254815
16297. for many immigrants for	many children the first thing they knew of israel and freedom was your	mother.	7.851725258908296
16298. sometimes it was dangerous for her.	15.620062873538785
16299. but she loved danger.	18.049251343074936
16300. she took it with her wherever she went;	she chose it.	10.532088926070996
16301. and i think she sought out danger as much as she sought	out helping other people.	9.547672475382113
16302. she was most strange woman.	17.22621989152487
16303. ready to	follow her impulse.	9.118533821976325
16304. it was an impulse when she was here in me'a she'arim-	i was with her- that led her to stay in israel.	11.05461830055603
16305. your	mother wanted to bring children to israel so that they could leave	their ghettos.	7.247711392583968
16306. here they did not need to be in ghettos.	22.6624072238526
16307. if she could	not take the children out of this section at least she could take other	children out of their countries and put them on the farms.	7.106399563847288
16308. she set	out to make sure that no jewish child anyplace in the world had to	live in a place such as this.	9.17746235794102
16309. i said quietly gaining nerve	ready to ask any question at all no matter how intimate ready to	be rebuffed then why did she leave israel?	5.908794646906176
16310.  i'd like to know	that very much.	6.583647739421961
16311. rachel clasped her hands together and slowed	her pace.	6.764147616291221
16312. the soles of her sandals reported sharply on the cobblestones.	9.430036403335416
16313. she pursed her lips then clamped them together so tightly that	i thought she was angry with me.	6.0970697385474
16314. but she sighed and her face relaxed.	14.886931241401385
16315. trouble came into her life.	9.629045873528531
16316. she had good friends here people	who liked her.	12.643324018154573
16317. but she had to go out and hurt herself.	16.58703363218215
16318. there was a man here in town.	30.535477582046838
16319. he helped her meet people so she could	go out and do the work she wanted.	7.005837398766889
16320. there was	a refugee who was able to come here because of her.	12.218030654432322
16321. he came with his	son.	15.738793212334095
16322. at first i thought they were relatives of your mother but it	was not so.	11.379371100645578
16323. this refugee was a middle-aged man a big handsome man	with a strut to his walk as i have never before seen.	6.534226343417566
16324. he had the black	numerals on his arm so he had been branded in a concentration camp.	11.075446599338019
16325. yet he walked like a young man.	9.433017005438765
16326. often he was terribly despondent	and talked to no one.	9.081415956492219
16327. then he would walk off for a few days alone in	the direction of europe.	8.743221707384611
16328. all his family was dead except for his son.	10.404965085493798
16329. your mother would always retrieve him when he wandered off and she	would send him home to his son.	5.864613642981335
16330. he loved the son and was always glad	to be sent back to him.	9.833125419174603
16331. then his son did something- rachel threw	up her hands- i don't know what but something to an official	here- it was during the mandate- and the son was imprisoned.	5.072220472864069
16332. a	few hours after the son was arrested your mother was informed.	7.615092762846159
16333. she	ran from a little group of us.	7.14162538120728
16334. we were sitting together talking.	17.58979361053657
16335. she	went to the father and found he had hanged himself.	6.452430126248838
16336. it was silent in the stone alley.	18.575160393141385
16337. then she continued with energy	i myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find	the father.	6.9917927838300775
16338. no one saw her except the man reuveni.	12.309971892301654
16339. i know him.	23.109657718690208
16340. rachel gave me a direct bright-eyed	look.	11.290352634939016
16341. she said reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep	interest in this refugee.	8.250968430575996
16342. he said she would only hurt herself.	17.04255706974967
16343. he complained	to me once that i must talk to her.	7.953394054598466
16344. when i did she shrugged	her shoulders and said that reuveni wanted her to marry him.	10.397571846551415
16345. i asked	her if she would and she said she would not.	8.540961853642917
16346. he had known when	he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she	did not intend to marry him.	9.019199881652007
16347. anyway i did not see her until two	weeks after the refugee hanged himself.	6.543402135208707
16348. she came to me one day.	14.108912181436505
16349. she	was pale and skinny; she was terribly alone.	6.850114810505649
16350. and she said that after	this man had been dead for a week she had gone to reuveni and accepted	his proposal.	9.11678666440246
16351. he shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldn't	understand why she had upset herself.	6.174920939052518
16352. but now he was happy she	would let him straighten out her life and take care of her.	9.799882239068868
16353. he would	never let her harm herself again.	9.783357976961607
16354. for one whole week he never let her	stay alone.	13.040828169792588
16355. she let him lead her around.	9.987973641461945
16356. he took her to a doctor	for she was run down nervous did not care where she was.	9.729686079637455
16357. reuveni took	her with him wherever he went.	7.14162538120728
16358. he did not let her talk to people;	he did not let her choose her own food.	11.30471158343011
16359. she was limp and beaten from	her loss; she did not care.	8.573199718930582
16360. and i'll take you with me.	12.994442504837197
16361. the two of them against the world.	13.92641097956076
16362. that had been how she imagined it.	13.72289676915941
16363. for when he began to talk and	dream all at the same time making his plans as he went she had begun	dreaming too.	7.545204212470379
16364. but now the dream was over.	19.61922653038531
16365. the big waking up had happened.	10.82217441035271
16366. what did i imagine?	18.039490430079823
16367.  she thought.	19.287214484918096
16368. did i see	him about to swing low in a chariot?	8.94379534209861
16369.  or maybe poling up the south	fork of the forked deer river braving the wastes dumped in it?	5.713104115160779
16370.  maybe	i saw him on a barge with a gang of ethiopians poling it.	7.911486024277803
16371. and i'll take you with me.	10.242612813271945
16372. he had taken her all right.	18.562694343417395
16373. wednesday nights after youth fellowship.	8.254441635698543
16374. out of the church and into	his big car it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights	sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college his expansiveness	the quaint little pine board tourist courts cabins really with a	cute naked light bulb in the ceiling	like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were	a kid where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs watching	a room complete with moths pinging	the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls an insect	highway patrol with feelers waving.	5.986819219601821
16375. and the bed that sagged in	a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before	and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when	gratt went out for ice the sound coming through the walls like something	on the other side of the curtain so you knew they heard you	when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had	heard you listened.	5.036690761957868
16376. and gratt shafer would be in memphis today	for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like	everybody knew he would just like everybody knew all along.	6.957619476292922
16377. like	mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and toonker burkette	back in his office yanking out teeth like they all knew he would.	5.205703059560665
16378. just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and	wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like	that would happen.	6.4197393212633305
16379. or you could hope the parachute wouldn't open	just so you could say you saw it not open not because you meant any	harm to starkey	poe in his suit of red underwear but mainly because	you were tired of being an old maid- a thing which cannot admit when	it thinks it might be pregnant but must stand the dizzy feeling all	alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to	say to somebody in a normal voice: i think i'm pregnant.	4.4959324438933965
16380. or you could wish your daddy would really do it-	kill gratt shafer like he said when you all the time all along	could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured	tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night.	6.805681548435265
16381. so you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to	the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights waiting for you	for your new spectator pumps waiting for you to squat by yourself out	there in your tight skirt crying and afraid and trying to get that damned	son-of-a-bitch tire off because that is being an old maid too	if you happen to drive a car it is changing the tire yourself in the	night and in the mud and the rain hating to get out in it but afraid	to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help.	5.323116527677601
16382. and every sound that	might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped	you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won't tell	a combination like ham and eggs rape her and kill her and that	is being an old maid too.	6.834002110140192
16383. it is not having his baby nestled warm	and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really	gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull.	7.6786570435999
16384. and most of all it	is not having the only man you could love whether he drives a bread	truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds	or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines for if you are	anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the	one.	7.358076495076158
16385. he can even be a mild-voiced little-town guy with big-town	ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even houdini couldn't figure	out how it is unlocked.	6.543223262990149
16386. and he can be on the way to memphis your	gratt shafer can and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and	love him and want him even if it means you want him- really want	him- dead.	8.585687760335208
16387. because if you can't then nobody else can either	nobody else can have him.	5.131654817312208
16388. for you don't share him not even with god.	10.38479854363946
16389. if it is love you don't.	21.087185825768106
16390. and i'll take you with me.	12.994442504837197
16391. even if that's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give	the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will	always believe it even when it is finally the only thing in the world	you have left to believe and the whole world is telling you that one	was a lie.	5.452973421581288
16392. even when he is on the way to memphis you will still	have the promise resting inside you like a gift and it is he inside	of you.	12.339693754207959
16393. and in a way the promise works out true for whether he wants	you or not you go with him in your heart.	7.825659334565296
16394. you feel him every mile	further away.	15.000064054538505
16395. you feel where he is and what he sees and at night you	feel when he is asleep or with the other woman the one that never could	love him the way you do the one who got him because she didn't	particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't.	7.031458883102943
16396. and you know	you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted	him so bad that you didn't get him and you can feel nearly sorry	enough to cry when you think of that other guy the chump who begged	you to marry him the one with the plastered hair and the car he couldn't	afford and the too-shiny shoes.	6.461182077397016
16397. you think: did he feel	that way about me?	9.751843329843403
16398.  it comes to you that probably he did feel that	way	to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have gratt shafer;	that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to	turn on or snap off when you got tired of him that other guy.	7.115538720699701
16399. it dawns	on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table	from you he was a man and that because gratt shafer was making	you miserable you were passing it down to him to gratt shafer's	substitute that other guy.	6.488535792913287
16400. and you wonder if that is why the little	man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he	straightened out and moved to st louis where he got to be a big	unhappy success.	8.450964373916698
16401. you wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of	you.	8.860781783058862
16402. you wonder about the christmas card with no name on it and it	comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody	else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself to give somebody else	the one they wanted- to give them you.	7.193316157399775
16403. damn the world	she thought.	9.118533821976325
16404. she looked out at the corn field the great green deep	acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewashed	fence bordering the grounds.	7.545456880125809
16405. the mayor envisioned factories there.	13.708848755179268
16406. homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway instead	of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your	heart while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand	and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments.	6.052400396476883
16407. the bands were impatient	but they were the only ones.	10.386928911886695
16408. the others the ones in the stands	were spellbound for hearing the mayor was for them like listening	to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in new york city.	8.028226920917442
16409. it was	like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano	virtuoso rehearsing.	8.543649186286444
16410. he was good and they knew that what he was doing	for them he would do all over the united states some day.	12.040833545832136
16411. so they	stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it not	listening exactly but rather feeling.	7.257461681701615
16412. if a man was good if he	was going to be governor you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever.	10.63351642693027
16413. you were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up	there you were someone else and the world was something else too.	6.981034556003128
16414. it	was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it.	7.410366695525521
16415. you	laughed and then your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a little	bit and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and	the goose bumps rippled along your arm.	4.586962801681476
16416. he hit the theme about dying	to defend your country and you were ready to do it right then without	a second thought.	0.0
16417. while he talked you wouldn't trade being a west	tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world	no matter if it hadn't in six weeks rained enough to wet a rat's	ass.	5.625573869945709
16418. she glanced at the man nodding beside her a man with	weather cracks furrowed into his lean cheeks with powdery pale eyes reflecting	all the droughts he had seen reflecting the sky and the drought	which must follow now in august- yes with eyes predicting the	drought and here it was only june only festival time again and thoughts	of gratt shafer would not leave her.	5.877408747556626
16419. i should have stayed at	the store she thought.	11.864200230381513
16420. back at the factory-to-you with	the other old maids back there she was the youngest clerk and she was	thirty-four which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working	conditions like the unventilated toilet with the door you had	to hold shut while you sat down.	6.214591994425442
16421. there was no lock because herman didn't	allow a lock.	14.170519501784666
16422. a lock on the toilet would encourage malingering	and primping.	9.59560366773705
16423. the toilet hadn't had a sincere scrubbing in years and	there were things written on the walls of the little boxed-in place	because you couldn't keep the public out- entirely.	5.419879683719088
16424. she could not	count the times herman had rapped on the door just a couple of bangs	that shook the whole damned closet and might someday break away the	pipe connections from the wall.	6.823988618237524
16425. the two little bangs meant that he	was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that	if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out by the opposite	door handle which she would be clutching whichever-the-hell clerk it	was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot.	5.252890045256293
16426. and the hours were six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night	on saturdays and during sales and there were no chairs and you couldn't	smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter	or janitor.	8.106234465317955
16427. among us we three handled quite a few small commissions from	spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick	lettering jobs.	5.92163188072113
16428. each of us had his own specialty besides.	14.472373245085803
16429. george	did wonderful complicated pen-and-ink drawings like something out of a	medieval	miniature: hundreds of delicate details crammed into an eight-by-ten	sheet and looking as if they had been done under a jeweler's	glass.	5.968057260730877
16430. he also drew precise crisp spots which he sold to various literary	and artistic journals the new yorker for instance or	esquire.	7.737261717505689
16431. i did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints:	naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the	doorway daring the cops to take him is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching	a revolver.	5.098733780586635
16432. the book could be the brothers karamazov but	it would still have the same jacket illustration.	9.377477445334648
16433. i remember once i	did a jacket for magpie press; the book was a fine historical novel	about edward 3 and i did a week of research to get the details	just right: the fifteenth-century armor furnishings clothes.	5.434195167413567
16434. i	even ferreted out the materials from which shields were made- linden	wood covered with leather- so i'd get the light reflections accurate.	6.290129093830134
16435. mckenzie the art editor took one look at my finished sketch	and said nothing doing rufus.	5.427950274147271
16436. in the first place it's static;	in the second place it doesn't look authentic; and in the third	place it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place-	you've got six colors there including gold.	9.114558822876091
16437. i said mr mckenzie	it is as authentic as careful research can make it.	7.033748404049442
16438. he	said that may be but it isn't authentic the way readers think.	8.80417241089532
16439. they know from their researches into television and the movies that	knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like little	lord fauntleroy and only the villains had beards.	6.7033574212062605
16440. and girls couldn't	have dressed like that- it isn't transparent enough.	9.73086604464448
16441. in the end i did the same old picture the naked girl and the guy in	the doorway only i put a lord byron shirt on the guy gave him a	sword instead of a pistol and painted in furniture from the stills of	a costume movie.	5.414311361343671
16442. mckenzie was as happy as a clam.	9.060328853487057
16443. as for donald he actually sold paintings.	11.68141985309769
16444. we all painted in our spare time and we had all started as	easel painters with scholarships but he was the only one of us who made	any regular money at it.	10.43355658063672
16445. not much; he sold perhaps three or four	a year and usually all to joyce monmouth or her friends.	5.83548883561448
16446. he had style	a real inner vision of his very own.	11.878371347693164
16447. it was strange stuff- it	reminded me of the pictures of a child but a child who has never played	with other kids and has lived all its life with adults.	0.0
16448. there was	the freshness of color the freedom of perception the lack of	self-consciousness	but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and	smack you in the eye.	8.193486687340618
16449. we used to kid him by saying he only painted	that way because he was so nearsighted.	7.588592075096724
16450. it may have been true for all	i know because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles	but it didn't prevent the paintings from being exciting.	8.896701291165934
16451. he also had	at times an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker; he would	look right through you while you were talking to him and if you said	for christ's sake donald you've got prussian blue all	over your shirt he would smile and nod and an hour later the paint	would be all over his pants as well.	5.150076656308588
16452. mrs monmouth thought of	him as her discovery and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a	painting.	8.469687314270228
16453. it was all gravy and donald didn't need much to live on;	none of us did.	8.662841246765407
16454. we shared the expenses of the studio and we all	lived within walking distance of it in cheap lodgings of one kind or	another.	8.047452625085427
16455. attending the life class was my idea- or rather askington's	idea but i was ripe for it and the other two wouldn't	have gone if i hadn't talked them into it.	5.47029843950587
16456. i wanted to paint again.	19.111389661529106
16457. i hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year.	8.061482068632769
16458. it wasn't	just the pressure of work although that was the excuse i often used	even to myself.	10.87699670653576
16459. it was the kind of work i was doing the quality of	the ambition it awoke in me that kept me from painting.	8.066532998872102
16460. i kept saying	if i could just build up a reputation for myself make some real	money get to be well known as an illustrator- like peter askington	for instance- then i could take some time off and paint.	6.925046946683116
16461. askington was a kind of goal i set myself; i had admired him	long before i talked to him.	5.604540605330386
16462. it looked to me as though he had everything	an artist could want joy in his work standing in the profession	a large and steady income.	8.90084016957252
16463. the night we first met at one of mrs	monmouth's giant parties he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket	with silver buttons and a soft pink viyella shirt; instead of a necktie	he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set	a lump of pale pure jade.	4.568070058943161
16464. this set his tone: richness of texture	and color and another kind of richness as well for his clothing and	decorations would have paid the brush-off's rent for a year.	6.812396398818006
16465. he was	fifteen years older than i- forty-four- but full of spring and	sparkle.	7.643264278376967
16466. he didn't look like what i thought of as an old man and	his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger.	6.442195345463429
16467. he was one	of the most prominent magazine illustrators in america; you saw one	of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national	magazines every month.	7.768199881830762
16468. life had included him in its modern american	artists series and had photographed him at his studio in	the east sixties; the corner of it you could see in the photograph	looked as though it ought to have velasquez in it painting the royalty	of spain.	6.824793025633019
16469. i had a long talk with him.	15.037623398637699
16470. we went into mrs	monmouth's library which had low bookshelves all along the walls	and above them a modigliani portrait a jackson pollock twelve feet	long and a gorgeous miro with a yellow background that looked like	an inscription from a martian tomb.	6.038796800520065
16471. the fireplace had tiles made	for mrs monmouth by picasso himself.	7.43304005989246
16472. like certain expensive restaurants	just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself.	8.708779403049375
16473. in the course of our talk askington mentioned that he	spent part of each week studying.	9.854180542414944
16474. no	i take classes with different people he said.	8.581436094141479
16475. i don't	think i've reached the point yet where i can say i know everything	i ought to know about the craft.	6.968947435711055
16476. besides it's important to the	way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere an	atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters as du^rer	went to italy to meet bellini and mantegna.	6.783224977108457
16477. he made	a circle with his thumb and fingers.	9.026368296067464
16478. painting isn't this big	you know.	10.472119682746735
16479. it doesn't embrace only the artist alone before his easel.	7.071358562973669
16480. it is as large as all of art interdependent varied multitudinous.	17.464378947867022
16481. he threw his arms wide his face shining.	9.785000633246698
16482. the artist is like	a fragment of a mosaic- no he is more than that a virtuoso performer	in some vast philharmonic.	11.100000170456658
16483. one of these days i'm going to organize	a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being	painted these days from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism	and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists	have in common with each other.	5.934703772940213
16484. the eye is all inward or outward.	12.535817155586281
16485. ah what a title for the exhibition: the eye is all!	what do you study?	6.196590298772555
16486.  i asked.	28.659110453221246
16487. i was fascinated; just listening	to him made me feel intelligent.	9.178593811447653
16488. i'm studying anatomy	with burns he replied.	5.1153798896086915
16489. he teaches at	the manhattan school of art.	9.783357976961607
16490. i had studied with burns	ten years before during the scholarship year the manhattan gave me	along with the five-hundred-dollar prize for my paintings of bums on	hudson street.	7.2483989123024175
16491. burns and i had not loved each other.	7.903555937577591
16492. i'm also	studying enameling with hajime iijima he went on and twice	a week i go to a life class taught by pendleton.	6.193954513283497
16493. my god is he still alive?	8.611532694892672
16494.  he must	be a million years old.	13.671139498061125
16495. i went to a retrospective of his work when	i was eighteen and i thought he was a contemporary of cezanne's.	8.022455398350196
16496. he's about sixty	now.	5.462725822855737
16497. still painting still a kind of modern impressionist beautiful	canvases of mountains and farms.	7.111586095572323
16498. he even makes the city look like	one of thoreau's hangouts.	10.090191208524187
16499. i've always admired him and when i	heard he was taking a few pupils i went to him and joined his class.	4.7359315159033
16500. yes it sounds great i said but suppose you	don't think of yourself as an impressionist painter?	7.476619026793552
16501.    you're	missing the point he said.	8.254441635698543
16502. he has the magical eye.	23.397430274692514
16503. and	he is a great man.	11.01564382774998
16504. contact with him is stimulating.	10.472119682746735
16505. and that's	the trouble with so many artists today.	8.652477872231358
16506. they	sit	alone in their rooms and try to paint and only succeed in isolating	themselves still farther from life.	6.961349362776885
16507. that's one of the reasons art	is becoming a useless occupation.	5.501313132759368
16508. in the middle ages in the renaissance	right up to the early nineteenth century the painter was a giant	in the world.	11.058403496631787
16509. he was an artisan a man who studied his trade and	developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did.	7.127984029954035
16510. he filled a real need showing society what it looked like turning	it inside out portraying its wars and its leaders its ugliness and its	beauties reflecting its profound religious impulses.	7.052669124945115
16511. he was a propagandist-	they weren't afraid of the word then- satirist nature	lover philosopher scientist what you will a member of every party	and of no party.	7.6193738999171305
16512. but look at us today! we hold safe little jobs	illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels	and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out	of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity.	6.459055731118145
16513. a bunch	of amateur dervishes! what we need is to get back to the group to	learning and apprenticeship to the cafe and the school.	7.370770344354934
16514. the upshot of the evening was that i got the	address of pendleton's studio- or rather of the studio in which	he gave his classes for he didn't work there himself- and joined	the life class which met every tuesday and thursday from ten to twelve	in the morning.	6.036909023269737
16515. it was an awkward hour but i didn't have to	punch any time clock and it only meant that sometimes i had to stay	a	couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job.	6.011050632364314
16516. after	a short time both george and donald joined the class with me so they	wouldn't feel lonely and we used to hang a sign on the door of the	brush-off reading out to work.	6.163860190831699
16517. it was mostly for the benefit of	the mailman because hardly anybody else ever visited us.	9.602919259281654
16518. in	a way askington was right.	11.629024855870329
16519. stimulating was the word for it.	8.369749079855636
16520. i don't know that it was always as rewarding as i had expected it	to be.	6.380534407398075
16521. partly it was because pendleton himself wasn't what i anticipated.	6.210871206873012
16522. i had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic	and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars.	9.400501415119518
16523. no that isn't quite fair.	10.628794361170721
16524. actually there was a lot	of force in him which is why i kept on in that class instead of quitting	after a week.	7.283136166520215
16525. such a little thing to start with- the car registration.	8.20052854651286
16526. ida where is the car license?	9.670406878971576
16527.  she asked.	19.287214484918096
16528. i can't	find it in the glove compartment.	15.387374944414505
16529. via must have it	i answered readily enough recalling her last visit.	6.002446559592496
16530. why should via have it?	16.85163603865572
16531.    had	she forgotten she had signed the car away that whatever they mutually	owned had been divided among the children?	5.15576524365156
16532.    i was silent.	28.71507759817604
16533. i	didn't want to stir things up.	7.622507342753323
16534. i drive my own car by courtesy	of via?	11.633205579815934
16535.    i'm sure she'd turn it over to you	if you'd rather.	3.9409848884369008
16536. she looked as if she were	accusing me of some fraud.	12.105435990052907
16537. she must have taken the registration	when she went to walter's.	10.523065830777204
16538. no	thank you.	15.594944937291627
16539. i want nothing of via's.	14.006185166748002
16540. why should this	suddenly assail her?	16.85163603865572
16541.  walter was giving me checks for my pay the	household bills.	6.278469055508673
16542. had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped	her mind?	9.339254759947023
16543.    what a fool i've been she said quietly.	9.927609577654419
16544. i knew all this but i paid no attention.	12.245663491535007
16545. i don't even own the	house i'm standing in.	5.165021441057559
16546. i was so sure it was all temporary h that	we would all embrace and then the lawyer would tear up all those things	h   it narrows down down down and finally there is no	way out.	7.079983185501868
16547. if i am not to be mrs salter i am nothing.	12.553380494022784
16548. i suppose i should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark	but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge	in.	8.034226478521962
16549. i love you i hate you i feel like killing you and myself	and in the same sequence i love you i think you're the most wonderful	the most noble and so on and on meanwhile eating a good breakfast	and dinner and enjoying living.	0.0
16550. so i went about my business.	17.221977618117535
16551. i made	a lemon sponge a light dessert roasted a chicken parboiled some	frozen vegetables so there would be something nice in the icebox for	the weekend.	6.093118043178204
16552. don't bother ida she said.	4.176400477476501
16553. i have these	appointments in town for saturday and i'll probably spend sunday	with dolly or the thaxters.	7.32855991512588
16554. at last i thought she's	recovering her spirits.	14.695306561184132
16555. with this movie-to-be in london and new faces	about her there she would soon be a more tranquil a wiser person	all the better for her stay out here.	5.449004783271807
16556. i felt more cheerful as if i	had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself.	7.764612682291188
16557. and i went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch	of life.	7.832613403894527
16558. it was foggy that evening but the path to my house was	so well grooved that i could feel my way accustomed as i was to	the dense mists that rise from the sun-warmed palisades of the river	and sometimes last for days.	7.072978406840345
16559. in the morning the fog was still thick	so that to go to the village i crept along with my headlights full on.	8.147954117779335
16560. i did notice a twinkle of light from the big house through the	woods but as i had left a light on in my own house because of the	fog i assumed mrs salter had done the same before she left for	town.	6.266902709427403
16561. i did my shopping had my dentist appointment and from there i	went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed	plans for the annual christmas bazaar so that dusk was beginning to	gather when i drove home in the late afternoon.	5.375729656237143
16562. but the next	day- sunday.	23.621507226357608
16563. why when i drove down to church didn't it speak	to me seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear?	6.368239651969534
16564.  prisoners	brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot	remember and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe	that the mind can remove absent itself unsee.	5.867756097854561
16565. when i came back	from church at noon mrs thaxter was turning into the salter driveway.	7.677276632993989
16566. even at a car's length i could sense that something was wrong	and so i followed her up to the turnaround in front of the house.	8.501616400468881
16567. dolly engisch was waiting there on the steps and she came	running toward us.	6.009824228690424
16568. she's nowhere nowhere! she screamed	and both women ran up to the house and i followed.	7.8390504062111965
16569. the	search began in all the rooms running upstairs down opening closets	talking exclaiming in rushes and gasps.	5.8530748053844555
16570. everything was as	i had left it the night before last- her portfolio and bag for town	her lingerie and dress and shoes laid out h only her mink coat was	missing.	6.503988993065903
16571. i who until	that day before had been mrs salter's friend her equal was the	servant now.	6.5779768796623195
16572. it was dolly and mrs thaxter who were calling via	everybody.	13.850842327221208
16573. and when they spoke they spoke to each other and not	to me.	12.440368839262636
16574. and after i brought them sandwiches and coffee i had to go back	to my place in the kitchen and wait.	10.648058214197713
16575. sitting in the kitchen	i recalled every word mrs salter said that could have been a sign	to me.	6.817267170322419
16576. if i am not to be mrs salter then i am nothing.	14.760782139133818
16577. why didn't that alarm me then?	9.684323749366209
16578.  and when she returned from taking	her guests back to new york she had said all they talked about	was harvie h harvie this harvie that h when they know the	truth will they drop away from me will i become a nothing?	6.724886762143437
16579.  and	then i remembered a few years before after their return from a short	trip to rome i had heard her boast over and over again on the	boat people liked me for myself.	5.818630519948233
16580. i had made a habit of calling	her at night from my cottage just to check.	10.59009312891203
16581. the last night i	had called but the line was always busy and it reassured me.	7.362967854122548
16582. i assumed	it was one of those hour-long conversations with dolly or constance	she comfortable in bed.	11.270037413315261
16583. but it seemed not from what they were saying.	13.000699769709389
16584. then was it a final desperate plea from her to whom?	8.887534383548
16585.  h hanging	on and on past any man's patience h some final stab of conclusion?	6.137658990167623
16586. 	she was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff.	12.37906702144426
16587. i tried to believe that what must have happened was that restless	disturbed by this telephone call or whatever she walked out in the	night as she had a habit of doing.	6.777343271333189
16588. sometimes she took the path that	winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff.	8.588539728090897
16589. it's	so romantic up there she used to say with the broad river gleaming	in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of	the night so poetic.	4.955340888472323
16590. with all that warm rain and the fog it might have	been as simple as a loosened rock a misstep.	8.585886056533983
16591. but i didn't	really think it was as simple as that nor did anyone else.	8.608791737370755
16592. when a	fisherman brought her up in his arms still small as if she were a	child asleep i began to shudder with a terrible excitement almost triumphant	that i still cannot account for.	7.096267704055124
16593. was it a hysterical release	from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks?	7.371540233837428
16594.  that at last the	vigilance the will gives way?	12.243227107821362
16595.  or what was it that before via	sonny walter and all i began almost to dance with shuddering and	cry out i knew she'd do it! i knew!   everyone stared	at me and drew back.	4.925808683293633
16596. their eyes turned cold and accusing even	via's.	10.00377092006671
16597. and they have never changed.	17.04543728184418
16598. at the same time that	i thought	i understood her at long last and pitied her underneath this knowing	had there burned unquenched by my pity a fire of hate an enduring	envy that burst out in that ghastly outcry?	7.589033466651726
16599.  was that what had given	way in me?	8.56621628280458
16600.  even now i am appalled at how little anyone knows	of what they really are.	8.257019223107607
16601. it is absurd of course to say that that one	exclamation estranged me from the family i considered my very own but	there it hangs a cooling void that broke our close connection with	each other.	6.601927825865812
16602. at the time i was filled with self-pity at this separation	but in the years since i have come to understand that the sight	of me was painful to them after that outcry.	9.797492801979597
16603. in my person they would	always remember that last long time of me alone with her so if they	told themselves that i could have prevented it i can understand that	by now and love them still because everyone must justify have a scapegoat	for what is not to be borne.	5.50094231524928
16604. it is not their avoidance	that rankles; it is when i meet someone who was a close friend of	the	family and therefore of mine and they nod to me so coolly and walk	away	that it hurts.	8.121400235548919
16605. i could tell them but no one ever asked why i had	cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body.	6.757808987581013
16606. no i forget	mrs mathias who had been away visiting a married daughter when	it happened.	9.181272083649247
16607. she haunted me; she persisted in explaining how and why	she had advised mrs salter to return to the country.	7.041590070118391
16608. we	all feel guilty i turned away from her coldly.	8.58366065009744
16609. she overplayed her hand.	12.783489925651207
16610. what do you mean?	32.209380504046656
16611. 	she frowned.	12.292407525564322
16612. why put such a high value on being top	dog?	10.484808224039835
16613.  i added.	22.589978126100267
16614. it was coarse almost insulting this harsh appraisal	and she has never come to see me since.	11.929246293622006
16615. but suppose she	had not taken mrs mathias' advice and lived on like thousands	of women in towns dispossessed of love hanging on to makeshifts and	altogether and finally arid.	5.322030096564122
16616. if she chose and in that final decision	discarded what above all all of us value life itself must she	not have risen to her fullest height and transcending her murky self	felt at last the passion of a great moral decision?	7.367095763843413
16617.  if they say i	could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks	of self-examination her search into herself and its conclusions.	6.938510943133008
16618. yes i had cried out that i knew she'd do it but without	my fully realizing it at the time it was a cry of triumph for her praise	at her deliverance from pettiness and greed- and guilt.	7.609266423733425
16619. she was	finally at rest in truth of her own proud free choice.	6.897938509958291
16620. at rest with	my darling ellen the first mrs salter.	10.922879821261143
16621. the funeral service was in the house the methodist minister	how clean and glistening his eyeglasses and his neat body standing	beside that coffin with that doll inside a stranger speaking to	strangers the old sacred words and the rain drumming incessantly in	accompaniment seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to	mud so the burial had to be postponed.	4.97949730629508
16622. then via called to	say they had decided to cremate her- as they had ellen the thought	leaped to my mind- and did i want to meet her at the funeral home	the next morning.	7.183469018210129
16623. the coffin stood on trestles in a corner of	the long low dimly lit funeral parlor on its dark shining surface the	sheaf of white roses i had ordered.	5.3772178264568815
16624. i knelt just for decency i	thought at the time but found myself whispering our father which	art in heaven h and it was only after that that something unlocked	in me and i felt a grief.	8.318385339707916
16625. via was in the parking lot when	i went outside.	7.693064659944322
16626. together we waited in her car until the hearse moved	out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of new jersey.	6.837250201201537
16627. by the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music	was already swelling out into the chapel-like auditorium with its discreet	symbols of religious faiths.	7.14651519516567
16628. again i felt impelled to kneel	and reached back and pulled via down.	8.65412245053527
16629. something would come into her	heart h if nothing else the sounds of bach would give her some healing.	5.779225712937922
16630. i had a rather small place of my own.	14.582386352025198
16631. a nice bachelor apartment in	a place called the lancaster arms.	7.190017756155806
16632. uhhu she said	hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid.	8.056432743398839
16633. and then	i had another place farther downtown i used as a studio.	7.822963906860331
16634. i'm not a man who has many close intimate friends	carla he said wanting her to know all about him.	5.299484884709106
16635. oh	i'd drink with newspaper people.	8.254441635698543
16636. i think i was what you might call	a convivial man and yet it was when i was alone in my studio doing	my work that i really felt alive.	9.40064825900292
16637. but i think a man needs at least	one intimate friend to communicate with.	9.643133799474999
16638. pausing he waited for	her to turn to ask a question.	8.457042904610558
16639. she showed no interest at all in the	life he had led back home and it hurt him a little.	6.371754886912092
16640. well what	about you carla?	15.32140162471316
16641.    me?	15.610129252044759
16642.  she asked turning slowly.	23.28689272597761
16643. what about me?	16.035421498336767
16644.    did you make friends easily?	14.877179522839205
16645. 	umm uhhu.	12.292407525564322
16646. somehow i imagine that as you grew	up you were alone a lot.	7.832164721647708
16647. how about it?	18.85123065321469
16648.    i guess so	she said taking a kleenex from her purse.	10.227318669010717
16649. when she had wiped some	of the lipstick from her mouth she stared solemnly at her image in the	mirror.	6.5043605971887795
16650. are your people still alive?	16.073780477193772
16651.  he asked trying	to touch a part of her life alberto hadn't discussed; so he	could	have something of her for himself.	8.008880859370759
16652. you talk so well carla	he went on.	13.503944917508555
16653. you seem to have read so much you have a natural gift	for words he added trying to flatter her vanity.	7.1617342544439
16654. you must have	been good at history at school.	14.472406603606382
16655. where did you go to school?	9.490694971130479
16656. 	what is this?	13.148092146312546
16657.  she asked turning suddenly.	18.355433542269985
16658. don't	you know all about me by this time?	7.716529372078614
16659.  my name's carla caneli.	10.62070307965623
16660. i sleep with you.	18.25917094604721
16661. you know something more about me every	day don't you?	10.430971598559564
16662.  would you be happier if i made up some stories	about my life told you some lies?	9.104191547914413
16663.  why are you trying to worry	me?	10.28470765609445
16664.    i'm not trying to worry you.	4.695968624969399
16665. the cleansing tissues she had been using had	been falling on the floor and he got up and picked up one then another	hoping she would notice what he was doing.	6.457144608871934
16666. at home he had been	a clean orderly man and now he had to hide his annoyance.	9.883833107504973
16667. was she just	naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance?	7.165023892188002
16668.  he	wondered.	19.804021762487697
16669. would he have to clean up after her every day clean the	kitchen the bathroom and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen	floor then hang up her dresses pick up her stockings make the bed	while she lay around?	5.105196761814669
16670.  he straightened up ready to vent his exasperation	then grew afraid.	10.090191208524187
16671. if he dwelt on the indignities he suffered	he would lose all respect for her and without the respect he might lose	his view of her too.	6.109563542403875
16672. what's the matter?	9.488114765205632
16673.  she asked	suddenly.	19.287214484918096
16674. nothing at all he said quietly.	16.42878866109561
16675. are those the only shoes you have sam?	8.909227299215745
16676. 	what's the matter with them?	11.061710713267546
16677.    the	heavy thick soles.	10.363724110347151
16678. they're an expensive	english shoe for walking around a lot.	5.254919823845219
16679. sam	no one around here wears such heavy soles.	6.764147616291221
16680. can't you get another	pair?	11.568363037656766
16681.    maybe i could he said surprised that she	could turn from herself and notice anything about him.	5.820825949681743
16682. i'll get	an elegant pair of thin-soled italian shoes tomorrow carla.	5.695891599889178
16683. and i don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit	she said making a face.	7.864016497921355
16684. what's the matter with it?	8.582712312947487
16685. 	he had put on the gray jacket and the dark-gray slacks and the	fawn-colored shirt he had worn that first night in rome when he had	encountered her on the street.	4.764069644022462
16686. you look like a tweedy	englishman.	18.58126317085929
16687. can't you wear something else and look a little	more as though you belonged?	5.674295354649883
16688.    i don't mind at all	he said delighted with her attention.	6.253064269674427
16689. changing his clothes he put	on his dark-blue flannel suit and laid away the gray jacket with the	feeling that he might be putting it aside for good.	5.026954524797121
16690. but it was a hopeful	sign he told himself.	22.49437965307618
16691. she no longer wanted anything about him to	remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in	parioli.	5.97174805050493
16692. that day they loafed around just getting the feel	of the city.	10.03801150365187
16693. they looked at the ruins of the old roman wall on the lower	via veneto then they went to the farnese gardens.	6.829546372023618
16694. she had some	amusing scandal about the farneses in the old days.	11.392473792487115
16695. then they took	a taxi to trastevere.	11.5339158979279
16696. there's a church you should see she	said.	4.914173891683686
16697. and when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at	santa maria he had to keep a straight face not letting on he had been	there with alberto.	7.0023290107854566
16698. he let her tell him all about the church.	10.697093789223626
16699. all evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself.	7.8287705230377425
16700. when they got home at midnight she was tired out.	11.902323396363775
16701. and in the morning	when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing.	8.687506432880586
16702. he	had never heard so many bells and as he lay there listening he thought	of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the	obelisk and the church at the top of the spanish steps.	8.173416461527896
16703. it was a good	thing that she clung to her religion he thought.	11.415239550625474
16704. she might like to	take him to st peter's.	10.749202706058774
16705. carla wake up he said	shaking her.	7.622507342753323
16706. aren't you going out to mass?	7.162179915621293
16707. 	you could take me to st peter's.	7.840709605621122
16708. come on you'll be late.	11.069026386656764
16709. i think	i'll sleep in this morning she said drowsily and as she snuggled	against him he wondered if she ever went to church.	5.643008810714759
16710. why did he	want her to go to church?	15.977716826734921
16711.  he wondered h probably because it was	a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security.	7.092812781698658
16712. it would	be good for her.	19.34224390285486
16713. it was too bad he had no feeling himself for church.	11.730645000805922
16714. not his poor mother's fault.	14.174471042466617
16715. she would have been better off	if she had stuck to her bible.	8.512850220478148
16716. as for himself he just didn't have	the temperament for it.	11.598596425103858
16717. from the time he had been at college he had	achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that	there were certain things he could never know.	5.864091825700597
16718. then he thought of those	old testament figures on the ceiling of the sistine chapel.	11.711369048743423
16719. just	figures out of a tribal folklore.	9.039542111835368
16720. could he honestly believe it would	be good for carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination	now?	7.170111233935536
16721.  being a woman though she would take only what she needed	from church.	6.596577939210777
16722. it was too bad he wasn't a catholic himself.	15.988519678954818
16723. or a	protestant or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists or a strict orthodox	communist.	7.488209025514629
16724. what was the matter with him that they all wearied	him?	12.282238410958582
16725.  it was the times he was sure.	17.552350950085547
16726. all the ideologies changing from	day to day right under his eyes so how could a man look to any one	of them for an enlargement of his freedom?	6.967923329638222
16727.  it was all too wearying.	22.145983344902916
16728. but where?	29.954223479466464
16729.  just the same he thought pondering	over it it would be a good thing for a girl like carla if she	got up and went to church.	7.250561503636671
16730. a half hour later he got her up to	go out for breakfast so the ferraros hearing them hurrying down the	stairs would think they were going to a late mass.	0.0
16731. it seemed to him	that if the ferraros felt sure of them could place them it would	help him to feel more sure of himself with carla.	6.162421227944651
16732. since we're	having coffee with them this afternoon he said i think	i'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean	for us.	0.0
16733. and he waited for her to say oh no i can do it	sam.	8.633713859320961
16734. there's so little to do.	5.932255538785735
16735. i'm not good at that kind of thing.	4.158644299462758
16736. this afternoon	let's take an air with them.	11.723189855790974
16737. let's be fine superior people of	great dignity he said as if he were joking.	6.492010221292005
16738. if you	find it necessary sam go ahead she said turning on the stair.	9.15537804959067
16739. i am what i am.	15.154494459409957
16740. her words remained with	him worrying him for hours.	9.691343871316892
16741. he didn't know how she would behave with	other people.	5.191528358925274
16742. when they walked into the ferraro apartment	the old lady bowing and smiling said softly.	10.813165376470906
16743. ciao and	put	out her hand.	9.118533821976325
16744. her little brown face wrinkled up her brown eyes gleamed	and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things.	6.7648792899935914
16745. agnese	smiling too said 'ello and then more slowly i	am happy.	6.210871206873012
16746. and they sat down and began their little coffee party.	11.586180538416901
16747. the ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee.	8.341215694113531
16748. acting only as	interpreter carla her hands folded on her lap was utterly impersonal.	7.695801622716029
16749. she would turn to them then turn to him then turn again.	7.2832281082570045
16750. watching	her he felt like a spectator at a tennis game with the ball being	bounced back and forth.	6.81735266046702
16751. signora ferraro bobbing her head encouragingly	asked sam about canada having a special interest.	5.674295354649883
16752. the old woman had a nephew from north italy a poor boy from	a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment and who	had migrated to canada to work on the railway.	7.994162513336997
16753. for a year the boy	had lived in the bush in a boxcar.	13.26234246874769
16754. did many of sam's countrymen live	in boxcars in the bush?	8.94379534209861
16755.  had sam ever lived in a boxcar?	8.654459114957467
16756.  she	wanted to know.	13.148092146312546
16757. regretfully sam explained that he had no experience	with boxcars.	9.276047963707047
16758. just the same the old woman said she would write to her	nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted	country.	7.18313579624749
16759. and sam thanked her and hoped he might meet her nephew	back home and asked her if she had any further news of the pope.	5.827597767360701
16760. a very great pope this one the old woman explained her black	eyes sparkling.	9.756900681676221
16761. it was	said that he had had a vision.	14.467427961627743
16762. just as thousands that day in portugal	had seen the sun dancing in the sky he had seen the same thing later	in his own garden and she turned to agnese for confirmation.	7.2014949462263615
16763. agnese	had been sitting quietly listening with the serenity of the unaware.	6.002446559592496
16764. now a little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in	her eyes.	8.730003663645117
16765. the holy father would die soon she said to carla so she	could translate for sam although he had a brilliant doctor a man	who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great	rulers of the world.	5.3185427444127935
16766. yes the pope could die and quickly be made a	saint.	10.301658290094627
16767. no he was indeed a saint now.	10.613740368160208
16768. nodding approvingly and swelling	with importance the old lady whispered confidentially.	7.879513779734377
16769. there was	a certain discontent among the cardinals.	12.25571297253927
16770. the pope in the splendor	of his great intellect had neglected them a little.	8.346523409839932
16771. there would be changes	made and signor raymond should understand that when the pope	died it was like the end of a regime in rome.	9.117511425549635
16772. jobs would be lost and	new faces would become prominent.	8.196044167676531
16773. did signor raymond understand?	11.38188706046207
16774. 	indeed he did sam said solemnly trying to get carla's	eye.	7.879513779734377
16775. surely she could see that these women were her italians too	he thought.	6.73388601895774
16776. devout orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in	brooklyn or malta or ireland.	6.886249538313906
16777. but carla; eyes were on agnese	whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness.	6.265484337755192
16778. and carla watching in wonder turned to sam.	10.977094251712717
16779. it means	so much to her.	14.93623902024112
16780. it's like a flame i guess she said in a dreamy	tone.	4.528462949720342
16781. but one night dookiyoon moved in the direction of the women's	lodge where shades of night had gone to purify herself.	7.79172639243305
16782. with	the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill	caressing the flageolet with his lips making it whisper.	6.330731650279925
16783. he saw her	emerge suddenly coming in her unhesitant fashion her back stiff her	head erect facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter	as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass	by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach.	4.806745041127664
16784. in her dark	scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination afraid of nothing	not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding.	7.437879717404829
16785. seeing her come he caught his breath feeling his heart	bounce in him and turned away afraid now.	5.292602449400731
16786. even he wanting her	afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit feared the evil presences	in her metabolism more.	7.213574498612472
16787. his breath caught and trembling he	closed his eyes and stumbled off.	6.9436170975920986
16788. going he saw as often before some	queer hideous yellow face over his head shining and weird like the	old images	which had invested him at other times like those that appear	sometimes near the eyeballs when they are perhaps pressed by the thumbs.	6.442726773134113
16789. he cried out to her his back turned.	9.026368296067464
16790. then he fled not	waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry.	9.26712372864712
16791. but	she heard him go.	9.118533821976325
16792. yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly	her neck tall as she looked in his direction and continued on her way	toward the end of the camp.	7.919280709729768
16793. elsewhere others heard and stopped	and waited the women peering from their lodges then gathering in	small curious clusters.	5.236383152695367
16794. early spring came from her bed from beside	her half-drunk husband walitzee and stood at the entrance way to	her lodge hearing the mild commotion the sound of hushed voices.	7.8297214287141035
16795. standing	there she saw shades of night come through the trees and stop	beside the lodge silent almost imperious her body taut simply standing	without speaking or moving while the wife of walitzee waited perhaps	denying the dread that moved in her.	4.745618896465282
16796. when at last she could suffer	the insult no longer nor face the girl's scorn she said in a	voice overloud:   i shall call your father! go back where	you can bring no harm or i will go and get the old man from his bed	so he can see your shame!   but the girl said only tell	him i am here that i have come.	5.683817806233489
16797. and it was not pile of clouds	she meant.	16.750967445766147
16798. but now with real anger at last something proud	and indignant early spring stood like a she wolf before her den	and cried i will not shriek at you! i will tell you to go not	begging.	6.8765491488319945
16799. telling you! and unsheathing the knife she used for	curing hides she stepped away from the lodge holding the knife at her	side.	5.332260504824848
16800. you bring only wickedness she said and it was not	to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her	lodge with the cunning hunger of a wild animal.	7.588146610095314
16801. speaking in a low voice	of loathing she went up to the girl who stood with the same upright	scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife.	6.634187063325649
16802. go	take helsq'iyokom your evil spirit to the young boys the	woman said.	8.28878684861628
16803. they do not have to face battle.	28.46297313040324
16804. i will not let your	evil in.	18.29003437131976
16805. i will simply kill you first.	13.10619877126925
16806. now go!   the other	women had come close now their voices murmuring together until they	stood buzzing in an angry knot their threats mingling rising nagging	at each other each trying to make her indignation and anger felt.	6.578859153239924
16807. they picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl.	9.662032643054193
16808. the sticks fell	like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny	points of pain along her thighs.	7.524276213220589
16809. they were all shouting at her as	if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought.	7.660009121126056
16810. but she did not	move taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme	youth until suddenly pile of clouds came howling among them swinging	a great bullhide whip.	7.026141634088911
16811. go back to your lodges! he	shouted.	10.036382981335299
16812. a pack of dogs makes less noise! he made the long	whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming some	tripping over themselves in their flight.	7.200091324775505
16813. and early spring seized	the whip and said:   if you must flog someone let it be her	your daughter.	6.695171945580384
16814. drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay	away from my husband! but the old man turned on her jerking the	whip from her hand.	5.996607848305864
16815. get into your hovel! he spat.	8.893662989748096
16816. go	back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body	among the young women.	6.757567981697296
16817. keep him back if you must tell me what to	do.	7.01871976722719
16818. i will be the one to confront my daughter not the wife of him who	leads her to sin!   she retreated before the naked shame	in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her	lodge where walitzee stirred mumbling sitting up in a half stupor	to say:   what worrisome thing happens?	0.0
16819.  i thought i	dreamed of wolves fighting.	12.02748832089418
16820. but she went to him and pressed herself	against his nakedness smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had	stolen from tuhulhulzote.	9.614992405890229
16821. she said there is nothing	that concerns you here.	11.2491100250592
16822. lie back and go to sleep.	10.762534548701684
16823. do not let the wicked spirits enter your brain.	11.379284422592765
16824. he sank back	sighing and was soon asleep again.	11.45143587764551
16825. outside the old man	beyond all the curses of the spirits his daughter bore went to her and	twisted the gnarled talons of his fingers in her hair and turned her	and pushed her rudely ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent	out a thousand arms.	4.583373069951134
16826. and shoving her against a spruce her back to	him he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp	air shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound	of it snarled and cracked settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders	while she stood as unchanged as dark and motionless as ever her	eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close	to her face.	5.537506429062844
16827. she said to him her father how was i begotten	in pain or joy?	8.09693267160073
16828.  is it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made	grow on me?	12.438464238311902
16829.  they all know your foolish name!   she stared	at the pale tracings on the tree hearing her breath refracted from	it her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark.	5.439344160937807
16830. she felt the lash bite and heard her father say in crazed monosyllables	words which had no meaning like unnnt! h sssshoo! the	sounds of an animal in rage and despair.	6.570496403096196
16831. suddenly the lash	stopped fighting the air and she heard pile of clouds say in his high	quavering voice:   did you follow me to see my shame?	5.456886484315849
16832. 	move from the line or i will settle the whip on you h.	7.198778874655976
16833. move! do	you hear the anger of the whip's whine?	6.460370037324521
16834.    turning the	girl saw dookiyoon standing between his narrow shoulders unbent his	arms hanging long and resigned.	7.644256405437687
16835. he said let me take her blows	for there are demons in me too.	0.0
16836. then without knowing why	she found herself running from them fleeing wildly through the trees	dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky	ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid	listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry.	6.604153216386561
16837. for a while the young men waited outside the lodge of tu	hul hul zote glorying in his harsh language as he talked with himself.	6.619091915427447
16838. he shouted like a hoarse old mastiff his hair stiff and bristling.	9.176540466704445
16839. he ranted and prophesied the doom of his enemies walking in circles	in and out of his living place drinking stolen whisky in great	gasping draughts until finally incoherent and sick he fell into his	own oblivion.	5.549160401341915
16840. he amused the young men who had been silent long enough.	13.56161529077165
16841. but they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution	through his antics.	8.439349620592315
16842. now they moved rubbing their flesh alive again	disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them.	8.534140025996345
16843. they	came out and held their games and races.	6.764147616291221
16844. it was they who held the	future in their hands.	15.046151236757142
16845. they went into the sun together and paraded grandly	in their war clothes painting their faces with the sacred attis	dug far off in the cave of skeletons.	5.873487878978511
16846. they danced the paxam	wildly at night the war dance and dipped their arrowheads in the venom	of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers firing their	few guns in unison at some indeterminate signal.	6.2259440676959015
16847. walitzee	was among them and sarpsis and they wore red blankets which flew like	broad wings in the air of their passing.	5.846759850076915
16848. and a very young one swan	necklace tried to emulate them and followed timidly.	10.450640859487239
16849. yellow wolf	was there nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead	in whom also the disordered chemistries of youth worked.	5.0247651535977464
16850. he would spring	bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction because	something had boiled over in his fermenting juices.	8.470936540516218
16851. all the	young men alokut among them challenged them in matched racing.	7.089892472913412
16852. they	raced and maneuvered for war swinging their horses in single file	and then abreast like cavalry.	6.886249538313906
16853. at times they would ride frenziedly through	the camp letting the women see their courage how handsome they	were in their regalia.	6.345278480807257
16854. then again they would stand in circles making	other preparations.	10.358453213057459
16855. they combed their hair and streaked it at the part	and greased the bangs so that the hair above their foreheads stood	rigid like the tails of sage hens making love.	5.7226572708616965
16856. walitzee whitened	his leggings with clay knowing the girl watched from her place in	the trees.	7.032105024464237
16857. he saw himself in a superior reflection and he was as a	speeding arrow from the taut bow hurtling with a mad grace his maleness	shining and scented with meadow rue.	5.595078496410314
16858. he was always aware of the women's	eyes which followed him admiring him.	12.210148865473238
16859. and the suspicious envenomed	eyes of pile of clouds.	10.160223907665735
16860. and those of early spring haunted	and now	full of hurt and envy.	11.493596978387801
16861. he felt so much like laughing; even	like shouting and crying out from the hilltops from which he could descend	as an eagle in a mad caper from the cliffs.	5.424610891102852
16862. he and sarpsis	planned a great parade with the young men.	11.575118156690358
16863. they would give one final	testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance.	8.134193899166632
16864. they would ride with streaming amulets their colors ripening in the	sun shouting the last bellicosity of a nation in the throes of death.	8.39759900366814
16865. and so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was	the young men's blood shifting then into the full heat and outcry	which ran with their hearts.	6.6464620629376885
16866. they mounted their horses and rode off	into the hills.	11.65570231342732
16867. the young chief stared at the wall of his	lodge listening.	8.139766469147519
16868. the sound rose on the other side of the hills vanished	and rose again and he could imagine the mad disheveled hoofs of	the appaloosas horses the white men once had called the dogs of hell.	9.145626641024002
16869. he saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across	the ridge.	6.795596449094281
16870. standing then with the others peering into the sun	he saw the bright multicolored legion their hair flying like dark banners	only the thunder the roll of drums the mad cacophony of the	hoofs accompanying them.	6.245681667690541
16871. they leaned into the wind and seemed like one	thousand-legged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose	straight in their saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted ejaculated	their grotesque cry of war.	5.187058251803353
16872. she was moving through a screen of hemlocks in among the white	birch and maples.	9.925099987581245
16873. the sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her	ears.	7.43304005989246
16874. she stood	once more listening.	16.217963900265392
16875. she had never been here at this	hour.	12.230847510388958
16876. she felt as if some dark totally unfamiliar shape would clutch	at her arm; but she found the path she always used the stubs of branches	she had broken those she had pushed aside; and she walked easily	now and more slowly until she could see the dark glisten of water	beneath her.	5.96947044632851
16877. if i ever committed suicide she thought i	would dive straight down from here- and no one would find me for days.	6.437198543709222
16878. she smiled and expertly let herself downward holding this known	root or that her sneakers sliding in the leaves.	7.39595678659273
16879. she jumped	out onto the flat expanse of rock and seating herself shook her short-cut	brown hair and tilted her chin far upward.	5.8391129598916525
16880. the reedy music of the	frogs had faded but presently it began again growing in volume until	it was vibrant.	7.333060553020843
16881. julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and clasped	her hands tightly around the bent knees.	5.467781152199419
16882. she had accomplished a miracle.	17.556434645016964
16883. the hour couldn't change it h.	9.802060557618772
16884. only-	only- her thoughts were a little strange.	9.600721036789164
16885. perhaps it was because it was so late and because she had	no business to be here now.	7.324559486417454
16886. she was thinking of paul a few	weeks ago in the easter holidays with her at one of those awful friday	evening dancing class parties her mother had made her attend.	7.596621430135751
16887. hello julie how are you?	8.254441635698543
16888.  h and then off he went so casually	to someone else with breasts better developed more obvious in a	lower-cut dress someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability	to find words that would hold him.	6.072150235895825
16889. i wish he was with me now she	thought and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once	only pretense and acute embarrassment.	5.854963833927876
16890. oh god! i wish i were	older or younger julia bentley thought.	8.42460784101292
16891. i wish so much someone loved	me.	12.063939880481797
16892. george rawlings remembered seeing the door	open sometime during the night- millie in a white robe standing	like a ghost at the threshold.	6.553532387213524
16893. she had vanished; he must have slept	again.	10.899296782422793
16894. he was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him.	10.599664273899362
16895. it seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch; but of course	the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this monday	morning.	7.611301030458665
16896. this room was like a prison.	13.868355812176231
16897. he would not be indebted	to sam! below him as if at the end of some remote tunnel he heard	the humming of a vacuum cleaner.	8.102464927143327
16898. his fingers fumbled across the bandages.	11.107172507795411
16899. they had left both of his eyes uncovered h.	10.119628519550561
16900. well he told himself	let's put the show on the road.	9.920307253430416
16901. he was walking across	to the bathroom.	13.571842788883787
16902. he drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with	both hands.	10.837130674235583
16903. a fearful pain had come from his head as if the water	were coursing up through the blood vessels and expanding them h.	6.7935773512877455
16904. he	recognized	his jacket and trousers.	11.568363037656766
16905. the fabric was dark; the stains weren't	too apparent; and there were his shoes thank god but his shirt	was one terrible mess.	5.838115260589918
16906. he shivered and then tore away the	blood-soaked parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf.	7.6557099336907095
16907. sam would be amazed to find him gone.	7.829807748422384
16908. millie would have to understand.	13.87089517846745
16909. she must have put his clothes in the closet.	8.925408409639196
16910. he found a lump rising	in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness.	8.63419886689002
16911. he was on	the verge of tears.	13.571842788883787
16912. alex poldowski- in a fashion he owed a debt	to that effete gentleman.	7.57232562622892
16913. at least alex had told him he wasn't dying.	9.808890756886335
16914. perhaps george rawlings would be better off dead.	13.346175443615218
16915. what	time was it?	10.363724110347151
16916.  he peered at his wristwatch.	15.385132030882776
16917. strange it was still running.	9.950021777329844
16918. too early for a vacuum cleaner but probably	sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs.	7.722580523507212
16919. he	was kneeling to tie his shoelaces.	7.738906147426005
16920. his fingers felt absurdly thick	and clumsy.	11.107172507795411
16921. he rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of	the closet door.	7.073919180620342
16922. this was some freak two	strands of adhesive tape across his nose like ugly roots from the mass	of gauze suddenly moist over his cheekbones.	7.441023353764672
16923. the surface however	was perfectly white.	10.915477388587384
16924. he was drinking another glass of water.	15.307648396335768
16925. it was after seven o'clock.	21.712086797476523
16926. he was supposed to be in court this afternoon	at city hall.	18.273873800014638
16927. who would take over?	12.554277641788625
16928.  he'd have to think	but the main thing the imperative necessity was to leave before sam	bentley was up and about and before millie detained him with sympathy.	5.996607848305864
16929. he was actually walking down the	stairs.	15.129042489400685
16930. a plane up in the sky above the clouds and this freakish	wreck of a man desperately trying to get away.	8.751417274022069
16931. father is	that you?	10.363724110347151
16932.  the voice issued from the cavern of the hall below.	11.08311283231638
16933. is that you father?	13.575722553750593
16934.  h who's there?	17.087763793182887
16935. 	for a moment he felt like a thief discovered.	6.460370037324521
16936. then julia	appeared under the arch leading to the dining room.	12.484703897091935
16937. she stood gazing	at him.	12.783489925651207
16938. uncle george!   he was trying to smile	at her.	10.03824795902721
16939. gosh! you shouldn't be up should you?	7.14162538120728
16940. 	i- i was just leaving here julie h.	8.581436094141479
16941. just	about to call a taxi.	9.1155892960807
16942. she was wearing some sort of gray	blazer.	16.08763268596675
16943. she seemed overly tall her brow knitted in concern.	7.953336273174813
16944. well	at least you won't have to do that she was saying.	11.193586036468904
16945. i'm	about to leave myself.	9.118533821976325
16946. you're	leaving?	19.804021762487697
16947.    i'm going back to school she answered.	4.0028807404405535
16948. i'm just finishing breakfast h.	5.161050289908855
16949. but	have you told mother you were going?	7.14162538120728
16950.  she asked him.	29.24879875779148
16951. i just don't want anyone disturbed julie.	7.933342431459963
16952. it's quite a big one he added.	3.793234504022867
16953. her face seemed to	float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight.	6.6158785931347355
16954. well won't you	come in then have a cup of coffee- or something?	9.523861354294501
16955.  h or maybe	a drink?	11.468845298593465
16956.  she asked in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated considerate	and yet perhaps partly scornful.	11.81578228011001
16957. he tried to see her face	more clearly.	12.90821743225415
16958. no- nothing at all he said after a moment's	hesitation.	10.997821029349234
16959. i'll just wait for you here.	4.8393280814891115
16960. he leaned	his head against the wood paneling behind him but the vivid red	images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids.	7.353566472956414
16961. julia moved past.	10.363724110347151
16962. i have to say good-by upstairs.	22.99023625893023
16963. as a great favor julie he said please	don't mention you've seen me.	8.380069593485432
16964. not to anyone?	22.595268048712263
16965. 	no- please h.	10.363724110347151
16966. i'll call your mother as soon as	i get home.	5.778634477885085
16967. it'll be so much easier.	8.254441635698543
16968. all right h	she was staring at him.	11.369735003123072
16969. please	you just go ahead.	9.118533821976325
16970. he could feel a	pulse pounding against the bandages.	13.348221553513474
16971. he imagined sam's voice: george	what the hell goes on?	8.431773034471274
16972.  i wouldn't have the strength	to answer he thought.	11.633205579815934
16973. maybe i couldn't have called a taxi.	9.00151463165996
16974. he could hear the footsteps overhead.	16.431638350461586
16975. he saw the suitcase which	julia was holding.	12.321816048478995
16976. i'll take that julie-	for you.	6.321180167012423
16977. i can manage.	24.78951553756042
16978. she went ahead of him.	14.140224473190667
16979. outside the lincoln was parked.	9.896815511556389
16980. he could	hardly believe he was getting in.	13.108894638193208
16981. pietro was gazing at him in an insolent	disdainful fashion; but that didn't matter.	5.674295354649883
16982. we'll	drop mr rawlings off in ardmore julia said and for the merest	second george was reminded of her father's tone with servants.	6.839926067009799
16983. to the manner born- odd to have such a thought at a time like this;	yet her inflection seemed forced or rehearsed.	6.721101961395464
16984. he could not stop	to analyze.	23.107350459713647
16985. he had never felt particularly close to her.	12.40786493691622
16986. carrie seemed	more affectionate but obviously julia had respected his request.	7.879513779734377
16987. i wish i didn't have to go back to school	she said and then i wish you lived in new york.	6.773123943063673
16988. that's	in the opposite direction.	11.568363037656766
16989. i wish i did he responded.	12.063939880481797
16990. i wish i wasn't wearing this ridiculous costume and that	we could go to a theater together or a nice restaurant forget we	knew h he stopped speaking.	7.395581700018071
16991. forget we ever knew what?	8.254441635698543
16992. 	oh just sort of everything in general.	9.060328853487057
16993. she	said nothing until pietro had slackened their pace.	6.764147616291221
16994. i know you	feel badly but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say.	11.480658773776337
16995. i'm supposed	to joke about things aren't i?	4.0028807404405535
16996.  h but sometimes life	can	be rather a disappointing business.	9.99899674210069
16997. his voice seemed thick	and purposeless.	9.627882438407596
16998. he could see the stone building	where he lived.	16.78663558193704
16999. just a few more steps h.	14.233983231243446
17000. abruptly he reached	into his pocket.	10.472119682746735
17001. yes there was the key.	12.76838303212735
17002. are you positive	you'll be all right by yourself?	13.409527127528452
17003.  she asked him.	23.0547882925987
17004. for a	moment he smiled.	16.99463381571157
17005. you've done me the greatest	possible service.	5.116336769843252
17006. by myself i'll be fine.	13.050414186351453
17007. take care	of yourself then.	11.466431740880703
17008. you also h.	26.845558008411693
17009. it was an automatic phrase; as he crossed through	the courtyard he regretted it.	9.751781947442868
17010. he should have discovered a more	tender farewell.	13.485563571156238
17011. someone shouted at him well! will you look	at george rawlings! what happened to you?	6.296303247585358
17012.    i bumped	into a door handle george said.	12.626880398769476
17013. george	walked steadily ahead into his entry.	7.622507342753323
17014. his bandages seemed on fire.	12.214555706636531
17015. he had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it.	8.34319516156394
17016. in the kitchenette	the raw whiskey made him gasp.	14.472504058424475
17017. just one or two swallows he	told himself enough to lessen some of the pain.	7.955352003852719
17018. no millie i'm home h.	13.484377447423066
17019. no really right as rain	h.	10.628794361170721
17020. tell sam not to worry about the car.	13.186351838497654
17021. i'll get it hauled away	h.	4.98254549585643
17022. no please- no visit today- i'll be asleep h.	9.76376045036682
17023. for god's	sake don't worry.	13.395684656180858
17024. that upsets me more than anything h.	12.064727433049098
17025. yes	sure	i'll see the doctor- this evening if you insist h.	6.210871206873012
17026. there was one more call to make.	22.72469917269577
17027. joan did i wake you?	9.085188587107783
17028. 	he asked.	15.594944937291627
17029. yes i thought you'd probably be up h.	8.005794851027492
17030. look	sweetheart	some fool was h.	11.568363037656766
17031. happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated	last night.	7.79207251847045
17032. unfortunately it turned out to be me but i wouldn't	quite put it that way to the boss h.	12.168694906642857
17033. oh hell no i'm not in a	hospital.	8.196452441250985
17034. i won't be in town for a couple of days though and there's	that case i was supposed to handle this afternoon.	8.94592541847605
17035. too bad a jury	isn't involved.	12.387593282809547
17036. i might struggle in for a jury.	13.681608345405717
17037. but i thought maybe tony elliott could pinch-hit for me.	9.823824458463788
17038. he'll	understand- you might give him sort of a tactful nudge.	7.879513779734377
17039. he's	got all the facts.	9.118533821976325
17040. i wouldn't want to ask for a postponement- it's	really just a routine thing h.	8.90859283341819
17041. what?	15.610129252044759
17042.  h no darling i'd	rather	you didn't come out.	10.704748211619375
17043. a smile pulled at the lower strip of	adhesive tape.	7.563545188002981
17044. i'll see you wednesday.	6.555878971993969
17045. i'll bribe you with a nice- he was about to say double	martini but thought better of it.	4.998922158566312
17046. i'll take you out to dinner.	6.139485272299999
17047. okay?	15.610129252044759
17048.  h	he had put down the receiver.	9.670406878971576
17049. a strange relationship	between joan fulbright and himself.	8.604265568338976
17050. who knew about it?	15.927170340228118
17051. 	she lived alone in the older part of the city in one of those renovated	houses whose brick facade some early settler had constructed.	7.989129267063153
17052. she	had two tiny rooms on the second floor.	10.491885415200374
17053. she was a clever girl a most	efficient secretary.	11.289976683769275
17054. she let him come and go as he pleased or as	it pleased her.	8.858500924185753
17055. in the office you might have thought them only casual	friends; yet	if he said: make an excuse yourself come out here today	she would have been on the next train- and similarly if she had	been in need he would have gone to her.	6.109176763338429
17056. they make us conformists look good.	14.49403709590128
17057. that's a peculiar	way to think.	3.7555369475624927
17058. it wasn't just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled	her own feathers of course; she knew that.	8.824488116887618
17059. it was jim's little	sister myra the unreliable irresponsible forever flyaway	myra.	10.91765306919435
17060. she's a year older than i am lucy told herself.	6.288774186460396
17061. come come jim said jollying lucy a little.	7.0513000618384325
17062. susan ready?	18.007491315085424
17063.    lucy listened.	17.38408943687016
17064. upstairs busy feet showering like raindrops pattered around her	room.	8.196044167676531
17065. susan would be visiting her grandmother for only a few days but	even at seven she was a prudent soul; she always packed for a lifetime	just in case.	5.991131652455976
17066. every doll in the house must be going	with her.	10.693850918155158
17067. she'd better step on it.	8.254441635698543
17068. it's a long way	to websterville.	2.4895117825465722
17069. jim's fine young face was an expressive one	too; as he looked at her it registered anxiety.	5.326519577128725
17070. myra wanted me to thank you for taking cathy.	10.681650701860299
17071. it'll be	only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in paris-	but even so she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful.	6.685535288039385
17072. lucy did not believe him; myra appreciated nothing.	11.06551977758392
17073. jim had	put the thanks in his sister's mouth.	7.395413813315722
17074. darling- she	said and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend.	7.032105024464237
17075. she should have told me herself.	9.987973641461945
17076. and will it be only a	couple of weeks?	11.68952805208105
17077.  remember what happened the last time?	9.495593234314278
17078. 	leaving cathy with them myra had gone out to the coast for a supposedly	brief visit; but she had stayed all winter and cathy had stayed	all winter too- with them.	6.252332956481403
17079. lucy suspected that myra would never	have come home if gregg myra's husband hadn't gone out to	fetch her.	5.781435728469172
17080. that was an awfully long two weeks.	14.357345820387483
17081. for	an otherwise silent moment jim's keys jingled nervously in his	pocket.	6.210871206873012
17082. but she promised- this will be different he said	at last.	14.697542560190653
17083. you've got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine	government job over there- she'll get a home for herself and cathy	in no time.	4.024857103387629
17084. you'll see myra's settling down.	5.110501839626448
17085. on the defensive	he added i wish you'd think what it must be like for her	to be without greg to be a new widow a young widow.	6.81894590535603
17086. it	depends on the widow.	11.568363037656766
17087. lucy had an idea that myra loved it.	8.043972472222215
17088. and	not for one moment did she believe that myra had settled down.	7.461352957445632
17089. it	seemed to lucy that all their married life she and jim had been doing	nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her	way of life.	4.6904158433825796
17090. remembering that succession of disasters she now considered	cathy an ominous child-cloud on her horizon.	7.143335555584588
17091. it was	not that she disliked cathy.	13.690897322221076
17092. the youngster drew her troubled her depths;	whenever lucy saw her she tried without noise or fuss to give	her the warmth she had never had from myra.	6.615080746783324
17093. but cathy was myra's	responsibility not hers.	11.276709257332119
17094. i wouldn't even be surprised	she said unhappily if myra tried to leave her with us forever.	8.030683036223671
17095. myra loved big cities; thousands of miles away- in paris	of all places- she might forget she had ever been a mother.	5.085047509821792
17096. lucy	knew her too well to find it impossible.	9.632336335666029
17097. that's a horrible	thing to accuse her of! jim was so indignant it was obvious that	no matter what he said he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-cathy.	4.557218808724159
17098. he went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up fiercely	susan! susan! get moving!   a startled piping	sound returned.	11.150643857475576
17099. don't yell at us lucy said.	3.3326417997438393
17100. was	it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front	of the house looking at the moon-washed river?	8.158140376151515
17101.  their arms around	each other they had been talking of the present and the future;	their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm as steeped in	light as the air around them.	5.237331314826428
17102. then from within the still sleeping	house the telephone had rung; myra with her news was on the other	end of the line.	7.6355685339673425
17103. jim turned back from the stairway and looked	at her.	7.509892222441323
17104. his dark brows which had been lowered in anger smoothed.	9.625285474671584
17105. there isn't a chance of myra's letting	anything like that happen.	10.686693545680784
17106. but they	weren't just friends lucy thought; they were husband and wife	and myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage.	7.494050081875058
17107. the only	thing that had ever come between them was that worthless selfish sister	of his.	6.374057384651866
17108. lucy was sick of it.	13.883606730631703
17109. well at last she said	because susan was clattering down the stairs.	6.972831155171896
17110. susan	looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse; her arms were straining with	a burden of dolls.	7.032105024464237
17111. do you	need that big bundle?	12.385585473978882
17112.  jim said.	18.64157714168038
17113. his voice had sharp edges as	though he knew very well lucy and he were not friends at the moment.	5.398794248435963
17114. all that junk?	21.783273943592054
17115.    susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes	that gushed an instant grief; to her each of her dolls was a real	person with a living heart.	4.909776356406901
17116. now now lucy said approaching	susan with a handkerchief mopping skillfully.	9.266626149434723
17117. your father	didn't mean it susan.	9.347724754445679
17118. she gave jim a quick shape-up look of	warning.	12.237614546569743
17119. he'll take every one of them.	7.089452416045856
17120. jim groaned	but he lifted susan's suitcase and said in a gentler tone sure-	the entire thousand.	8.001519098980625
17121. and when you get back from grandma's cathy	will be here to play with you.	7.436077916051048
17122. nice?	19.804021762487697
17123.    no susan	said grappling with her outsized armload of dolls with a scrooge-like	effect.	6.716105803734982
17124. and at this point lucy thought there should be	a lecture on little cousins' sharing dolls- but she could sympathize	with susan; there ought to be a limit to sharing too.	8.966895055504638
17125. that was one more reason she didn't look forward to cathy's visit	short or long; the last one had been a lilliputian war.	7.353001608924499
17126. she suspected	that cathy had been competing with susan for attention that she	had never had.	8.171394947443085
17127. well jim said out of the silence let's	get going dolls and all.	7.687918857765682
17128. when the car with susan's	hands waving wildly from the rear window disappeared down the	driveway lucy stood looking after its pale dust.	7.772389272189366
17129. the day was brilliant	around her- flower-scented crisp with breeze- yet her inner turmoil	darkened it.	7.322558899011958
17130. she had let jim go with a chilly good-by a chillier	kiss.	10.38284173950151
17131. she was sorry and angry at herself because never in their	life together had she done that.	6.663669558562791
17132. she turned and began to walk toward	the house.	13.444073056755334
17133. at the feeding station the raffish group of cowbirds	again bobbed and gobbled over the ground but now gorgeous among	them was a beautiful red cardinal radiant in its feathered vestments.	5.668324243626168
17134. the handsome bird was solitary; its mate must be at home silently	guarding their nest.	8.086542342015262
17135. she had better stay there lucy thought; the	sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels.	6.5343679463363715
17136. well lucy?	22.682241119862002
17137.  she said to herself abandoning the cardinals	and the cowbirds.	9.4058555100984
17138. she had a day of things to do; among them she	had to prepare the guest room.	10.730673603427377
17139. how long would it be occupied?	11.10320013158952
17140.  she	wondered with a baffled feeling of helplessness.	9.060328853487057
17141. as long as the unscrupulous	myra chose?	19.06745287836458
17142.  for a moment her mind returned again to the	strange flying world of birds and she said to herself.	9.350131171448735
17143. it isn't	only birds that dump their children in other people's nests h.	8.132629406549228
17144. in the sunshine of late afternoon lucy stood looking at the ready	guest room.	11.031621916588294
17145. there were new yellow curtains bright as a child's	life ought to be a new bedspread lively with hopping rabbits and hanging	from the ceiling was an airy mother goose mobile spinning slowly	in the breeze.	6.422930533210372
17146. a row of little hangers waited for a child's clothes	in the neatly empty closet; since myra had always put most of	greg's money on her own back lucy suspected that no more than a	few of that long row would be needed.	5.937255106143827
17147. the closet was faintly fragrant	with lavender and as lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into	her mind like a lavender ghost: greg's house on the day he	was buried and the child pale silent baffled watching the funeral	guests with panicky eyes.	4.760132271476245
17148. many times since his death that memory had	worried and troubled her.	8.898940894184594
17149. out in the hall the upstairs phone	shrilled and the small ghost vanished.	8.959501446240017
17150. when she picked up the receiver	her mother's cheerful voice was there.	12.939804232471447
17151. websterville	junction calling she said.	9.118533821976325
17152. i just thought i'd let you know.	14.51280320979358
17153. myra dropped cathy this morning and jim picked cathy up and left	susan a few hours ago.	5.978659012997842
17154. i'd have phoned sooner but i've been	busy.	6.387716491741345
17155. i can imagine! susan was an active character;	for mother to be able to call susan must be napping now surrounded	by her multitude of dolls.	6.838894254163777
17156. lucy drew out the chair and sat down;	she relaxed a little and some of the tension went out of her.	10.027156574830302
17157. you	could think yourself as grown up as methuselah yet the maternal voice	still kept its comforting magic.	5.326519577128725
17158. but myra was the merriest widow i ever saw.	11.077418040299065
17159. on	her way to the airport on her way to paris- you bet lucy said	to herself.	6.352402166275158
17160. i've been fixing up the guest room for cathy.	5.255920864658871
17161. there was a momentary pause and then her mother said how long	is she supposed to stay?	8.95784170098684
17162.    just for a couple of weeks	till myra finds a place for them.	12.432788566905796
17163. well- this time	there was a long silence while the telephone hummed faintly with	a voiceless life.	6.015664698407893
17164. puzzled lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper;	her mother was forthright; she was not usually given to mysterious	silences.	6.946266737654473
17165. was she thinking along the same lines lucy was- that	it was quite possible cathy might be left with her for good?	5.3711728626979625
17166.  you	mean once myra gets to paris?	9.670406878971576
17167.  once the soft pretty moth	found the bright light she had always wanted?	7.709272298701606
17168.    suddenly seekingly	lucy asked mother do you know something i don't know?	8.769081829770185
17169. 	again there was that curious pause and then her mother	said i guess i do.	5.542917982132687
17170. just before myra left- she was saying good-by	to cathy and she didn't realize i was near.	8.40183351169311
17171. she hesitated	as though hunting over words and ways of putting them.	7.622976253277199
17172. cathy was	in tears of course and i heard myra say 'now be good and at	christmastime i'll send you a wonderful present from paris'.	6.157942065974489
17173. shocked speechless lucy sat there.	8.254441635698543
17174. then she jumped to her	feet the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake.	8.715828113299075
17175. christmastime!	then it was no bogey she had dreamed up; it was	only too true.	5.918583952151286
17176. myra had no intention whatever of sending for cathy in	two weeks.	8.207038953518303
17177. for a moment anger darkened the hallway about her	and when she found her voice anger thickened it.	7.6137480823503845
17178. that does it!	she said.	17.150845923962493
17179. i'll keep cathy for two weeks.	4.8393280814891115
17180. then if myra	does nothing about fetching her i'll pack her right back to her mother-	if i have to take her myself! her hand tightened on the	receiver.	8.146397646337789
17181. and that's what i'm going to tell jim.	5.957732529075614
17182. for	lucy the day's nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end.	8.518975250796936
17183. as she hung up she saw through the hall's open window the purple-black	flying of the cowbirds' wings and heard their grotesque singing.	5.978111298919799
17184. cowbird myra! she's not going to get away with it.	11.039754578190696
17185. cathy is tired lucy thought watching them come slowly up the	path.	6.002446559592496
17186. the child's thin legs were plodding.	12.435529358277208
17187. she trudged along slowly	both hands clutching a tired teddy bear.	7.533469760296565
17188. she was at the moment just	a small walking package being delivered to her aunt's and uncle's	house.	10.817107610048062
17189. unlike susan she was traveling light; the worn teddy	bear a tiny suitcase that jim carried and the clothes she wore were	all she had.	5.034820959678682
17190. lucy glancing at the miniature case knew there would	not be enough in it for the shortest of stays; they would have	to buy things for her.	7.0800362529838035
17191. unimpressed the dog plopped on the sand.	7.14162538120728
17192. quint couldn't blame	maggie for disbelieving.	10.472119682746735
17193. for eleven days they'd done the same	thing leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast before esperanza	beach got jammed with tourists and beach balls and show-offy lifeguards.	5.299281454132446
17194. the swirling sand made quint's limp more pronounced.	10.582206877639416
17195. they walked	slowly past the sherbet-colored cottages- eleven lemon nine mint	seven orange- around the curve to a deserted stand with an eats	sign jiggling in the wind.	5.296400689620221
17196. now they were in friendly territory.	21.44452749430452
17197. nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping	jaggedly to the water's edge.	6.18936217805711
17198. his rock was to the right of a	v-shaped inlet a big brown lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers.	9.016781834077488
17199. his rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here.	6.63678588733321
17200. here he was enclosed and safe.	14.111161948418587
17201. along didn't he have a red swiss hunting knife on his belt- ten	here was a perfect place to lie	down and make believe.	5.488656300275507
17202. he was canute controlling the waves.	17.218119440805356
17203. he was	a knight of the round table sir quintus the brave slaying	evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses.	5.688487478421003
17204. he	was the first astronaut on the moon chosen because of his small size	and intrepid nature.	8.025697366803096
17205. he was six feet one like his father with big	hands and a hairy chest a man the weak and persecuted would turn to.	6.088837098129518
17206. every night when he wanted a drink of water didn't he practice	being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light?	6.681762940203835
17207.  a dark	bathroom can be pretty scary and he'd creep back to bed proud of	himself thinking: tomorrow for sure i'll go down to the rock	and keep my promise to dad.	5.219618456030456
17208. he hadn't intended to make the	promise.	13.671139498061125
17209. it happened two weeks ago the night before his father left	on a business trip to south america.	8.317635764706727
17210. every piece of the nightmare was	clear in place; and when he woke up his father was saying stop	screaming quint.	7.446543256209536
17211. he	could remember the feel of his father's big hands the thump of his	father's heart sending out signals- regular like radar.	5.410428361733103
17212. let's	talk about the beach.	11.568363037656766
17213. while i'm gone you get brown and	fat as a pig hear?	6.690361575131689
17214.  look i can put two fingers between the cords	in the back of your neck.	10.274956723480337
17215. dr fortman says swimming would help your	leg.	8.368929611987813
17216. he says you're limping more than you need to.	17.230864589606583
17217. how	does he know?	10.363724110347151
17218.  big dumb nut.	13.148092146312546
17219. in	the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the	promise spilled out.	5.708486897250457
17220. when you get back i'll	probly be swimming better than victoria.	12.237791293612464
17221. victoria was fourteen months younger than quint a head taller	and could lick any boy or girl on the beach.	5.16779369904362
17222. she called him stuck-up- that's why nobody plays with	you mister stuck-up.	9.118601195872367
17223. or what was worse she prayed for him out	loud at bedtime: please lord gord please give my brother the	strength to go swimming like he promised.	5.076202226443464
17224. quint said now to the clouds.	10.615487304810483
17225. strength began to zip	up and down his chest.	6.764147616291221
17226. he felt strong as a giant.	15.761231234058247
17227. he unlaced his high	brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg.	7.256372103253096
17228. he wadded his	sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks.	8.819487411186232
17229. goolick goooolick creaked a sea gull.	7.622507342753323
17230. aw shut	up he said.	11.568363037656766
17231. he stood on the rock a skinny dignified boy	surrounded by the ocean.	8.975607205665444
17232. the wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades	and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing	each other he could see his head down there bleeding wedged between	the rocks and the waves.	6.3204354633079065
17233. i'm scared	of the nightmare.	4.113546812337769
17234. shivering he put on his clothes.	10.718850325513241
17235. and shivering	with shame he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat	into the water.	6.919664373311319
17236. watch it big shot a hoarse voice yelled	back.	9.555741032581421
17237. she was holding on to his rock with one hand.	8.552824482390005
17238. she wore a bathing suit like his mother's no straps	on the shouders.	10.20681109446276
17239. why didn't you duck?	12.299552866609114
17240.  he snapped.	27.770505909397876
17241. is.	15.610129252044759

17248.    i said quint.	22.150701097072105
17249. quintus in latin means-   i can speak both	kinds of latin smart aleck.	5.825820622377272
17250. her cough sounded like cloth ripping.	11.190090126764806
17251. you shouldn't smoke so much he said unconsciously	imitating victoria's holier-than-thou voice.	8.821949062257234
17252. she was horrified.	24.933130579944567
17253. not having said hell before he stumbled a bit before gathering	momentum.	7.197996988212524
17254. sometimes eleven fourteen a day.	12.388847385676296
17255. if i	was your mama i'd wop your tail off.	8.847147922174463
17256. my mother never	wops me.	14.81826163601321
17257. i've got this leg brace.	4.830320705807231
17258. she seemed so unimpressed	that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see	his brace.	7.720129820082413
17259. dingy-looking was what she said.	8.254441635698543
17260. why don't	you paint it red and white like a barber pole?	8.596725039113435
17261.    because	maybe i won't have to wear it always.	7.008241843048604
17262. dr fortman says if	i exercise my leg more maybe i can use a cane when i'm big.	7.218626433544212
17263. she spouted a mouthful of water into the air.	7.953336273174813
17264. someone's walking past you want to stop him zoooop	snag him around the neck with the crook in your cane.	8.093347803586537

17299. artfully	as the days went by he found occasion to tell her that his father had	won the navy cross in the korean war; that his baby sister could	spit up through her nose when she felt like it; that he personally	had an iq of 141 and was currently reading the mushr to ozon	volume of the encyclopedia.	4.23408077896144

17309.    he hadn't.	21.889553134177078
17310. but it	was such a nice thought that he nodded his head.	10.013069068738902
17311. either that or	a veterinarian.	11.408005278127304
17312. better make up your mind son sabella	said.	10.692886452583213
17313. you can't serve cod and salmon.	6.855509851267169
17314. she said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward.	11.168308606614596
17315. his	encylopedia agreed with sabella.	9.118533821976325
17316. next morning he tied a bunch of	sea daisies with string and threw them across the v-shaped inlet to	the rock where she was swimming around.	6.642237957233456
17317. boy could she catch! like	willie mays in the outfield.	6.460370037324521
17318. nobody gave me flowers before.	12.824363553681563
17319. her face turned pink with pleasure and a	smothered cough.	7.227998241277275
17320. you can always tell a real gentleman- they got	a certain je ne say quok.	10.227163129646067
17321. sometimes they didn't talk	at all.	10.778242481272796
17322. he daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around.	10.520890708513011
17323. once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered don't	feel like it he was tempted to tell her about being scared.	5.740823337836594
17324. but victoria began yodeling just then and he went home carrying	sabella in the back of his head not thinking about her just knowing	she was there smiling smelling of peppermints.	8.228124856534718
17325. as for his promise-	oh he had plenty of time buckets of time.	9.24153888929746
17326. they were eating breakfast.	20.21684821830791
17327. we beseech thee lord	gord to bless this food- that was victoria saying grace while	the baby sprayed raisin toast on her plastic bib.	5.590409876268566
17328. same old breakfast	till the phone rang making his mother's voice shake with excitement.	7.198778874655976
17329. your daddy's in san francisco she told	them.	9.252578846337226
17330. he says he'll be here on the one-o'clock plane.	15.657309201052776
17331. fifteen	days early- isn't that wonderful?	8.254441635698543
17332.    yeah keen.	15.594944937291627
17333. a cave seemed to be opening in quint's stomach.	8.996892744512474
17334. children	we'll have to get organized.	14.196620102412831
17335. the baby can have an early nap.	8.976097203071156
17336. victoria	i want you to h   quint closed the screen door	quietly so maggie wouldn't	be scared.	7.422387021669865
17337. hurry up we're late he	said noticing with a chill how gray the sky was this morning the fog	like a rope along the horizon the choppy waves sending off sheets of	blue and kool-aid green.	4.574127654067155
17338. the cave in his stomach hurt.	12.435529358277208
17339. he	had to go into the water.	8.470174847651478
17340. he'd tell sabella about the nightmare.	9.670406878971576
17341. it	had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung.	11.251739370258289
17342. what caused	it he didn't know.	14.705292966559352
17343. the metal collar gagging his neck?	9.802060557618772
17344.  sweating	so much?	15.594944937291627
17345.  the unbearable weight on his chest?	9.802060557618772
17346.  all of it together	meant drowning.	29.299044487657717
17347. the first time the nurse took him out of the lung she	said if he got frightened she'd put him back for a second.	8.0553888618149
17348. when bobbie evans smashed up his car the jaguar his wife linda	had given him for his last birthday and himself quite thoroughly	with it driving back from an afternoon's golf at oakmont it seemed	to mark the end of a long miswritten chapter in the social life of	the community.	6.7993678787651115
17349. linda looked remote yet lovely in black and everyone	held his or her breath.	5.878387974542516
17350. not that linda was heartless not that	she would do anything prematurely or in bad taste any more than john	cooper would.	8.524060940793232
17351. hadn't linda been a perfect wife to bobbie who	was the least bit of a disappointment all these years?	5.15576524365156
17352.    wasn't	john cooper even more attractive at forty-seven than he had been	twenty-five years earlier?	7.198778874655976
17353.  and wasn't john's wife edythe	even more appalling if possible?	8.108856755126041
17354.  didn't john cooper after all	this time deserve something better of life?	7.615092762846159
17355.  wasn't it adult and	realistic to look at it that way?	8.009357736034532
17356.  and romantic?	25.51753309664205
17357.    everybody	knew that john cooper had married edythe on the rebound.	6.210871206873012
17358. it was	the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life and it was a tribute	to john's strength of character and very real business ability that	it hadn't ruined his.	8.352503640757066
17359. of course there was nothing you could	do but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen	mousie chandler said to linda stuart.	7.09160503428937
17360. poor john! linda	accepted the reproach which was something she did rarely in all	her life and most rarely in that summer of 1936 when she was by all odds	the prettiest and brightest young woman west of the allegheny mountains	and john was surely one of the handsomer and brighter young	men around pittsburgh.	6.326578128008235
17361. for it had been john and linda ever	since she had come out two seasons before at the golf club to the goggle-eyed	admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow	debs.	5.996040990427804
17362. john had claimed her from the stag line a young man a year out	of dartmouth with skiing crinkles still around his eyes.	7.418987695602054
17363. you	saw them always together those years.	7.622507342753323
17364. you talked about john-and-linda	as an entity.	15.000064054538505
17365. john-and-linda were at longue vue last night;	john-and-linda drove to conneaut in three and a half hours.	6.475768214884213
17366. then there	was a spat over something as there had been lovers' spats before;	only this one didn't heal.	8.005298684988253
17367. you still said john-and-linda	but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such	as the depression or dillinger.	6.387750609618937
17368. it got worse instead of better.	17.14115455215059
17369. first	it came out after mr cooper's will was settled- he had died	the year before- that john and his mother weren't rich any more.	4.853876284793092
17370. and then there was linda's engagement to bobbie evans.	15.634861138796419
17371. there was no connection between the two events because bobbie wasn't	rich either though he was more aggressive than john.	8.881820816551434
17372. he was	a bright and handsome young man from new york who worked for the same	steel company as john did.	8.259196719464562
17373. some people said linda had just	announced the engagement to jolt john into some action but when john	came home from a business trip to cleveland with edythe with edythe	his bride it could no longer be john-and-linda even to sentimental	wishful thinkers.	5.252317140368718
17374. it wasn't even john and edythe.	16.49084636425047
17375. it was simply	poor john.	24.470021671401657
17376. there was nothing specifically wrong with edythe	but there was absolutely nothing right about her either.	11.409391836053057
17377. mousie	chandler had been to school with her someplace near baltimore and	tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at horne's.	5.423200438743683
17378. well you shouldn't underestimate edythe	mousie said.	12.107821717729271
17379. i know she gives the impression of being shallow and	frivolous and scatterbrained.	9.264550548487307
17380. she is frivolous and scatterbrained but	she really isn't shallowh.	12.125130315572168
17381. bobbie and linda looked	magnificent at their wedding.	7.14162538120728
17382. john was at the church with edythe.	18.862074677034368
17383. she	giggled during the ceremony and mousie chandler who was one of	linda's bridesmaids said john glared black as death at her.	5.265014257282416
17384. as	if he were choking she said.	9.670406878971576
17385. poor john!   edythe	settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example.	6.614337193451302
17386. her hair	never seemed to be in place and her skirts were never quite the correct	length.	9.928837082570277
17387. she didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the	pool at longue vue but her bathing suits were far from smart.	4.735186012382186
17388. and	you didn't see her much at longue vue or anywhere for john had drifted	away from the gang.	6.643215071337043
17389. mousie said it was because he was too proud	to stand pity.	7.8974109311507386
17390. others thought he couldn't stand seeing linda mrs	bobbie evans still so beautiful so much in command of everything.	7.392419388654074
17391. there were less-dramatic reasons too.	19.22736494415148
17392. john's mother	died not long after his marriage and there was even less cooper money	left.	8.63362243339883
17393. john sold the big old place in sewickley and bought a smaller	house in fox chapel.	5.813137145238302
17394. he was not reduced to poverty but his job	at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing	the day.	9.418185031048122
17395. john was good at his job.	8.682999937193333
17396. it probably wasn't hard	for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing but edythe	to come home to.	9.401394831618845
17397. though that may be unfair since ben cooper john's	first son came along early in 1938 the cutest baby you ever saw	and a blessing that he looked all cooper from fontanel to pink toes	nary a trace of edythe.	4.946162714454803
17398. but the continuing charm of the other	children- sally in 1940 and jack in 1944- and all john's success	at his work only made edythe's dizziness and general uselessness	more glaring.	7.286720553524535
17399. she never could fit into a crowd which had known which	still knew and admired linda.	6.443516098323249
17400. when there was bridge at edythe's	house the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food	probably was wet graham crackers.	8.07086143835309
17401. she managed a missionary drive	for the church once and got the books so confused that old mr	webber the eldest elder who'd never donated more than five dollars	to anything had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal	in what edythe called the bosoms of the church.	5.072981774522021
17402. john did find	the missing checks and money afterward and the drive was actually	oversubscribed	which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries.	6.867063288232372
17403. being an intelligent man john must have guessed what everyone thought	about edythe but he never let on by so much as a brave smile.	5.844045589499417
17404. poor	john was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering	and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one.	7.106125913808397
17405. he was an attentive	and generous husband overgenerous a lot of people felt because they	knew that money must be a problem to him.	8.256647421327132
17406. but he got ahead in business:	on leave from his job to an important washington assignment	during the war; after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel	company.	8.541570909762434
17407. the coopers saw bobbie and linda socially but	no more than was necessary.	6.817408452020724
17408. bobbie had been successful too though he	didn't match john's pace and after all he didn't need to with	all the stuart money.	6.290129093830134
17409. he and linda settled down to being social	leaders and linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year.	7.18370571642585
17410. and then came the hairpin turn the smashed jaguar and linda	mourning alone and lovely.	9.402105372657616
17411. everyone held his or her breath.	9.13191999944639
17412. don't think linda couldn't have got john back any time	if she'd tried mousie gordon who had been mousie chandler	said between bites of a chicken sandwich at a luncheon table at le	mont.	4.976040033109436
17413. now you know she could've but she isn't that kind of	girl.	7.659369886910187
17414. but now- well it would be a blessing i think.	13.433283398076581
17415. linda evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed	bobbie's death could move her to feeling.	5.326519577128725
17416. what she felt was a bone-deep	loss with a sense of waste to it not so much sorrow for handsome	ambitious bobbie but for the lost years that had been brought into	high relief by his death.	8.218753224535936
17417. she knew what people were thinking;	it was what she had been thinking herself.	7.230155065663667
17418. it was up to her to save	poor john dear john to undo the wrong she had done but she trembled	at the decision as at the brink of a cold stream.	7.809793703943046
17419. there	was no one who would blame her or john; she could be sure of that.	7.003877977110556
17420. it might be rough on edythe at first but linda and john between	them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her to send her	back to cleveland or anywhere.	8.136072806475493
17421. and linda felt capable of capturing	the affection of the children anxious even since she and bobbie	had had none of their own.	6.122530829619739
17422. it would be good for them to have a mother	they need not be ashamed of.	17.979322522664187
17423. linda would have to wait she knew.	10.400142648781694
17424. but what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty	years gone by?	11.213327209719381
17425.  years of watching while poor john struggled without	the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get	ahead.	6.9230169265240775
17426. of course he had done wonders h.	16.715570389689407
17427. alloy steels and	regular steels had different sales departments at smith + macisaacs	where john and bobbie both worked.	5.236383152695367
17428. bobbie had been head of the	alloy division while john was just another good salesman in the regular	branch.	7.339825651011452
17429. so when old mr lovejoy the company president talked	about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the	head of the regular steels had gone with carnegie-illinois it looked	like the perfect chance for bobbie.	4.911187751080247
17430. for linda knew how to help her	husband not just the stuart-family contacts but also the little dinners	for reuben lovejoy.	8.204157206369054
17431. she was almost sick when bobbie	came home with the news that poor john had won the job.	7.089114136270735
17432. what did	you do?	20.3435750720723
17433.  she asked bobbie.	23.0547882925987
17434. you must have done something something	wrong.	18.10596542702654
17435. lord knows i had everything set for you.	6.764147616291221
17436. bobbie	said something about damned pittsburghers sticking together and	linda got angry at him.	7.391013650626644
17437. they had their first real fight and bobbie	went off to get drunk.	8.037235810279766
17438. linda dragooned her uncle donald murkland	into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened.	10.352735587807167
17439. he	was a director of s + m and must have been in on the decision.	7.5977160740288845
17440. but jolly old uncle donald would tell her no more than that bobbie	had certainly been considered for the job but there were factors in	a large company which outsiders and even some insiders couldn't understand.	8.165167372420544
17441. he didn't tell her of the long board meeting where	bobbie and john were weighed one against the other.	5.40279408178442
17442. i'm	behind john cooper mr lovejoy said finally.	9.060328853487057
17443. i think we're	agreed that he and evans are equal in ability so we have to look	at the thing in terms of incentive.	7.5240650500488995
17444. now i believe poor	john'll work just a little harder.	10.25020956383039
17445. with that wife of his i think	he feels every chance he gets is his big chance.	6.769782582135979
17446. bobbie with linda	behind him will have plenty of other opportunities.	8.392032887190927
17447. and also the	money can't mean as much to bobbie.	9.55705674680083
17448. bobbie will take the	job as his just reward and work hard at it; poor john will take	it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting	up nights worrying about us.	5.762497154626007
17449. most of the directors nodded.	23.12330172206288
17450. uncle donald murkland found himself nodding agreement too.	10.03824795902721
17451. after the surprise was over linda was almost as pleased as anyone	with john's good luck though she agreed with bobbie's decision	some months later to move to funk furnaces.	5.589400311014037
17452. the job at funk wasn't	particularly better but it got him away from being subordinate to	john and assured him steady advancement since funk was owned to a	large degree by various branches of linda's family.	6.488837204329327
17453. poor john's	rise continued to be meteoric.	9.325090889926027
17454. when he was made a vice president	only a year after the new sales job a leading business magazine ran	his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business	leaders of the future.	8.383205477682472
17455. she called then to say she had a baby-sitter for that night.	7.242113557397471
17456. shirley	appreciated the chance to make some money.	11.495395327634762
17457. such a nice little thing-	lives right in the building.	10.30121484855742
17458. that's swell i	said sweetly.	5.189262973849371
17459. i could get along without that three dollars.	11.715657417052107
17460. in some	ways it was worth being out the money- just knowing i was no longer	obligated to nadine!   it was past midnight and we were in	bed when the phone rang.	6.879048612281881
17461. i stumbled through the hall wondering who would	be calling at this hour.	7.319167417194751
17462. i answered to find nadine at the other	end.	11.830577004608054
17463. you scared me half to death i said shakily.	9.055448890993684
17464. what's	wrong?	19.804021762487697
17465.    janice nobody answers at the apartment!	her voice came shrill.	6.460370037324521
17466. i'm absolutely frantic! that stupid girl	might have gone off and left francie!   oh she wouldn't	do that i said.	4.896974283486748
17467. she's probably fallen asleep and doesn't	hear the phone.	5.199450184176683
17468. but if you're worried you can go home and check-	i can't leave the party! we're at ken thom's	apartment and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat!	old mr thom is already down on wally and we simply can't	afford to get ken mad at us-   i was all set for what	came next.	6.152396849097998
17469. janice could you possibly go over and make sure everything's	all right?	6.415468355087985
17470.  i'll call you there in ten minutes-	i can't make it in ten minutes- wondering as i said it	why i should make it at all.	5.18619578137508
17471. why should i go over at midnight to	check on francie when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party?	6.469338403271855
17472. 	fifteen minutes then! please janice.	10.472119682746735
17473. i'll	be glad to pay you-   so sure that money could do anything!	all right i said.	5.427950274147271
17474. not for the dollar or so	nadine would give me.	11.648754778032233
17475. but because there was the chance that something	had gone wrong at the apartment and if i didn't go over who would?	7.6247051729019715
17476. 	chris was sound asleep and i didn't see any	sense in waking him.	7.391013650626644
17477. i dressed in the kitchen then left a note on the	table telling him what had happened.	6.942454971535347
17478. i drove off through the cool	darkness to nadine's apartment and rang the bell and in a few seconds	a young girl opened the door.	8.024574634019446
17479. her face was flushed from sleep.	8.820367666516145
17480. it's	all right i said as she started to look scared.	7.879513779734377
17481. mrs	roberts had called and couldn't wake you.	7.14162538120728
17482. i just came over to	make sure everything was all right.	11.844314920673773
17483. i'm- hard to wake	up she faltered.	7.622507342753323
17484. she didn't look over thirteen.	9.82466777404044
17485. and nadine	insisted that her sitters be reliable! i have to get up early	for church tomorrow she went on.	7.78166993713371
17486. i didn't know it was going	to be this late!   the phone started ringing.	7.078862845359374
17487. that's	mrs roberts again i said.	8.254441635698543
17488. i crossed	the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone.	11.055482970001897
17489. i told	nadine everything was fine and that i'd be getting on home.	7.319167417194751
17490. janice would you mind staying?	10.472119682746735
17491.  there was a ragged edge	to her voice now as if she'd been crying.	10.45952032493186
17492. wally's drunk-	i'll get him out of here as soon as i possibly can but i don't	want shirley to see him like this.	7.840174320429657
17493. you know how gossip of that sort	spreads through an apartment building-   not a word of thanks	for what i'd already done.	7.449779715343103
17494. the receiver clicked in my ear.	12.435529358277208
17495. she	didn't even give me a chance to refuse.	8.488541179710262
17496. well there wasn't any	law that said i had to stay! but then i looked at shirley and thought	that i might as well- the child needed her sleep and heaven	knew what kind of a mess it would be with wally coming home drunk.	7.042501754009068
17497. so i told her mrs roberts would pay her in the morning and she	scooted off to her own apartment.	7.878578610941888
17498. after i looked in at francie	i went into the living room and waited.	10.795459912892081
17499. i must have dozed off	because i came to with a start at the sound of voices.	9.4001363535477
17500. nadine's shrill	with anger- wally's loud and thick- as i went to the door	i heard the clock strike two.	7.491373624736424
17501. i opened the door and wally stumbled	in- fast- as if nadine had pushed him.	6.789400154986115
17502. i had always thought	she was so beautiful.	15.194901253950778
17503. but now she looked ugly.	15.024580417649798
17504. her skin was stretched	so tight that her cheekbones stuck out and if looks could kill	wally would have been dead.	7.3207383838212
17505. pack your clothes she hissed.	8.254441635698543
17506. pack- and get out!   you're crazy wally said	thickly.	8.581436094141479
17507. he lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on	it and was instantly asleep.	6.512874137333827
17508. nadine strode over to him and her pointed	nails raked across his face.	8.302927158263225
17509. i grabbed her arm and she turned on	me and for a scared second i thought that maybe wally was right and	she was crazy.	5.941837843639923
17510. you stay out of this she spat at me.	16.129299891999754
17511. he's ruined us- do you hear me- he's ruined us! he insulted	ken thom! her eyes were wild.	3.9073319185288464
17512. he told ken to his face	that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman! and the other	people there were listening! we're ruined and he's going to	get out if i have to throw him down the stairs-	you'd	better simmer down i said nervously.	7.098859681013789
17513. in the state she was in she could actually kill him! now	you just take it easy and i'll make you some tea-   tea	nadine screeched.	7.22081878483761
17514. how can you be so damn stupid?	17.600991277905738
17515. 	wally's lost his job! ken will never forgive him- never! and	we	don't have any money- we don't have a dime! all we own is francie's	bedroom set and the televison-record player and we even owe	on them.	4.319657710113772
17516. and we'll be poor and have to live in a grubby little house	like yours- and all because of that-   i clamped my hand	over her mouth to stop the stream of filth.	7.615957797498564
17517. stop that! you'll	wake up the whole building.	9.019385823163804
17518. wally can't go any place at this hour-	well then i'll get out- but she looked	uncertain.	6.886249538313906
17519. she was coming to her senses enough to realize that you don't	go traipsing off anywhere at two in the morning.	6.972341006932173
17520. you	go to bed i said curtly.	9.670406878971576
17521. in the morning you and wally can talk	things out-   she collapsed against me as if everything	inside her snapped.	7.540268055075078
17522. i got her into bed and sat with her until she had	sobbed herself out.	8.613473101510026
17523. it was three o'clock before i figured it was	all right to go.	9.543590119202564
17524. i left her a limp bundle of self-pity shivering	with terror because her bubble had burst around her.	7.9047212310212736
17525. wally was snoring	on the davenport.	8.254441635698543
17526. i had done all i could.	17.078670524292253
17527. i had done all i was going	to do.	10.865611456511958
17528. whether or not wally lost his job was no concern of mine.	10.975374363092428
17529. i drove home found chris still asleep.	9.95288923829895
17530. i snuggled up close to him-	loving him- thankful for a man like him.	11.319790410759657
17531. i kept on being thankful.	12.384361145835424
17532. in the afternoon nadine and	wally came over with francie.	14.905865517289762
17533. wally sat in our big chair his hands	between his knees looking ready to cry.	5.542917982132687
17534. i'd had all this trouble	with the old man that's why i drank so much.	5.679625534332775
17535. i- got fired	yesterday for not attending to business-   old mr thom	himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job wally	confessed and couldn't get one because there were cars on the pits	waiting to be repaired.	4.549247498068394
17536. seems that the kid wally had hired had a repair	business of his own going on the side.	7.41460447310778
17537. mr thom had gotten wally	on the phone and fired him.	7.2145133336552725
17538. i thought i'd smooth things over	through ken wally said miserably.	10.9139775682409
17539. but ken got coy and wouldn't	make any promises.	9.374544754266388
17540. and i was plastered and i blew my stack-	and told him right to his face he'd never slept with	a woman! i tried to quiet nadine because the children were there.	7.382578196099366
17541. but she was beyond caring what she said.	10.663567680672758
17542. things may	smooth over yet chris said his nice lean face grave with honest	concern.	7.815882109593322
17543. but i couldn't help thinking that nadine and wally were	getting just what they deserved.	7.918006249628549
17544. now maybe they'd realize that life	can be tough.	10.368578803405029
17545. when a bubble breaks there's nothing.	12.929198695578592
17546. little by little during the week chris and i discovered the crazy	unbelievable way nadine and wally had lived.	7.045567369063586
17547. they had not only	spent every cent- they were in debt up to their necks owing on everything	they owned.	7.574703463234913
17548. on top of everything else they were two months	behind on their apartment rent and the day wally received written	notice that he was fired they were evicted.	9.623245268546569
17549. worst of all	wally had no training for any kind of work.	6.784071257234468
17550. he had fallen into a soft	job and now the job was gone and he was stranded.	11.573658967217728
17551. i wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide	them over.	9.0878186480308
17552. i said i wished we were too.	14.09703525864984
17553. it was easy enough	to say it because of course we couldn't spare a cent.	9.077870169851655
17554. but chris	brightened up like a candle.	14.306364280244424
17555. i'm glad you feel that way honey.	3.7561014555225434
17556. there is one big way we can help them.	23.6435506133928
17557. we can let them move in	with us-   something i had simply never thought of.	7.585798118642999
17558. something	so incredible-   i just stared at him.	9.060328853487057
17559. it was incredible-	he gave me an embarrassed pleading look.	11.859831723497784
17560. i know we'd be	pretty crowded.	19.53967019564306
17561. but it would only be for a couple of weeks- until they	get straightened out.	13.041095544949645
17562. straightened out- they'd had	years of making all that money! i won't do it i said flatly.	6.757567981697296
17563. nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this!	well now she can sleep in the street for all i care!	that isn't like you janice chris said uncomfortably.	5.751193186667168
17564. then i felt uncomfortable too.	17.103474989621958
17565. i didn't want to be like that mean	and bitter.	8.142110213506248
17566. but darn it all why should we help a couple of spoiled	snobs who had looked down their noses at us?	8.220363016466244
17567.    but in	the end we did.	13.036658898681127
17568. it just seemed as if there was nothing else to do.	12.463321849769464
17569. the finance company took all their furniture- and they didn't	have a cent to their name.	6.196120048044738
17570. to my way of	thinking he was scared sick.	11.823445273844255
17571. his luck had failed him and it was easier	to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world.	6.556117431620236
17572. chris made trip after trip in our old car moving the clothes and dishes	and the stock of groceries nadine had bought on special.	6.257537285696144
17573. at least	we'll eat i thought grimly as i put all the food away.	7.067989463905285
17574. while i worked nadine sat and cried.	11.435329938441214
17575. when she wasn't crying she	was in our bedroom fighting with wally.	8.439793096585671
17576. virus infection nothing	she'd	scream at him.	10.472119682746735
17577. you're too lazy to go out and look for	another job.	7.459312180456436
17578. you're just a no-good bum!   it was a mess	all right.	7.729246099822045
17579. but it couldn't go on forever- a couple of weeks	chris had said.	10.852165702454927
17580. i figured i could stand practically anything for a	couple of weeks.	9.812384578167253
17581. but the two weeks dragged into three and they	were still with us.	8.324822006799968
17582. nadine's constant nagging had finally gotten	wally out of bed.	8.196044167676531
17583. he set out every morning looking for work and come	home around noon full of alibis and excuses.	7.455201778831352
17584. wendell thom had black-balled	him.	11.94288351290035
17585. nobody would even take his application.	9.147427017633976
17586. you	can get something nadine would snap.	12.529640803072772
17587. you can get a job working	in a grocery store if nothing else.	11.81063493927217
17588. the high school	kids have got everything sewed up he said a whine in his voice.	9.051668232660505
17589. those damn punks- taking work away from men who need it.	7.012877753432631
17590. by fall they'll be back in school i'd say	trying to sound encouraging.	9.134815060030421
17591. but this was only the middle of july h.	13.165818050965296
17592. and i couldn't take six more weeks of this.	12.33461022388823
17593. i mentioned	it to chris one stifling hot night when i had slipped outside for	a breath of fresh air.	6.217952046658703
17594. i don't really believe in intuition.	6.9964157625729735
17595. but i swear to	you from the moment i opened my eyes i knew it was going to be a	bad day.	9.559956758895535
17596. part of it was the weather so foggy it would take me twice	as long to get to the hospital.	17.42997529148026
17597. part of it was being so tired- i'd	not only had my usual full day yesterday but a dinner meeting as well	that kept me up late.	8.293160923932536
17598. but the rest of it the main part wasn't	based on logic at all.	13.97400313065019
17599. it was just going to be one of those days.	21.104111713690568
17600. for the thousandth time i wished i'd chosen some nice nine-to-five	five-days-a-week profession.	10.260657800663019
17601. and for the thousandth time i	answered myself.	13.754763744890315
17602. i hadn't chosen medicine- it had chosen me.	11.633205579815934
17603. actually i shouldn't complain i told myself in the shaving	mirror.	7.042432407464575
17604. i had a lot to be thankful for.	15.706622089957264
17605. a profession that brought	me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at.	6.046198409504693
17606. maybe i	didn't see as much of gladdy as i'd like but how much worse it	would have been if i'd had to board her out somewhere after alice	went- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home.	5.972804159839659
17607. at least	we were together and we had mrs hodges bless her to look after	us- no mother could be fonder of gladdy than mrs hodges was.	5.789114474463283
17608. i	was lucky in lots of ways no doubt about it.	8.849748296114601
17609. especially in the	way gladdy had turned out.	8.042312307198674
17610. growing up without a mother from the time	she was three- it wasn't a good thing for a child even knowing	the kind of mother alice had been.	6.855939537751569
17611. but i mustn't start on alice.	14.483620915616667
17612. she is a closed book a picture i keep on my bureau but never look	at.	9.985338388060926
17613. if she'd kept on as she'd been going the story i'd told	gladdy would probably have been true by now anyhow h   as usual	gladdy's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table.	5.391391018402269
17614. her	first class wasn't until ten but she always got up to have breakfast	with me.	7.032105024464237
17615. it made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided all	on her own to go to college right here in town made me feel good too.	7.516005362226808
17616. oh i knew that i couldn't give myself all the credit for her	decision.	9.985470208556963
17617. i had a feeling that young pete michelson the most promising	intern at fairview had something to do with it too.	8.054306807390562
17618. she'd	been out with pete the night before and her gay chatter about	their date lightened my mood a little.	7.31721310179654
17619. but once i was alone again	driving	to the hospital the heaviness returned.	8.1836398577547
17620. if she and pete were	really getting serious i'd have to do some hard thinking.	12.447336394274936
17621. should	i tell him the truth about alice?	7.240698345721332
17622.  did he have a right to know the	secret i'd kept from gladdy all these years?	9.328921001086536
17623.    the boys were	already waiting in the corridor outside my office when i got to fairview.	7.1014319628718034
17624. two interns and dick ishii the other resident.	9.85829515947488
17625. i'm chief	of medicine here and this morning would start like all others with	me taking the boys on the rounds.	4.120009240391504
17626. pete was down on seven dick	told me and he'd meet us there.	7.80063608173729
17627. there wasn't anything of	special interest that morning no one sicker than they should have been.	6.647123092534057
17628. pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on seven-	he'd had a case of post-operative shock but it was all taken care	of now.	7.906567139218194
17629. seven is a women's floor and as it happened not very busy	right then.	7.207276509191768
17630. when we'd finished our regular rounds pete pointed	me toward the small ward at the end of the floor.	10.783449935239952
17631. got a new	one in last night he said.	6.764147616291221
17632. i haven't seen her yet but i	hear she's a lulu!   i wasn't surprised.	8.278768802315167
17633. the ward was	a small one four beds kept reserved for female alcoholics.	6.817408452020724
17634. we didn't	get many at fairview and they were never pretty sights.	10.463115467880524
17635. it was	thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular	charity ward.	8.246475594204645
17636. the moment i walked in the whole miserable feeling	of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed.	8.120086297692296
17637. they'd cleaned	her up some of course and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk.	5.9385640295867885
17638. but there was something about her- and i felt my lips forming	a name.	14.602404447300664
17639. alice h but this woman's name was rose bancroft!	i looked at the chart for reassurance.	5.716688447118552
17640. yes rose bancroft	diagnosis: acute alcoholism.	13.110616200649021
17641. she looked about sixty though i recalled	that the chart gave her age as forty-four.	6.440940776014829
17642. an ugly scar disfigured	the somewhat familiar puffy face already marred by the tell-tale	network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry.	6.705539101318056
17643. her coarse hair	was two-colored- bleached blonde and its real dirty gray.	6.6158785931347355
17644. oh could it be?	13.980946987867025
17645.  no no h it was an unfortunate resemblance	that was all it was and i turned to dick forcing myself to put my	disquiet out of my mind.	5.977984272122407
17646. in a low voice dick filled us in	h	she'd been picked up downtown passed out	in the doorway.	9.039207186855426
17647. although quiet when they brought her in she'd suddenly	turned violent and had to be knocked out.	7.427570112492865
17648. it was the old story.	31.431065131255714
17649. we'd keep her a day or two and the aa people would talk to her.	5.255979100796317
17650. but if she wasn't interested she'd just go back to the same life	she'd left.	13.73333456294067
17651. turning toward the patient again i- i can't	describe what happened to me then except to say that i felt sick.	6.55597364820236
17652. i tell you it took every ounce of control i had to be able to	speak.	15.4426260887291
17653. now miss- or is it mrs bancroft?	9.765930310601922
17654. 	i never	liked going straight into an examination with patients- it relaxes	them i've always thought to chat first.	6.643215071337043
17655. this was one time i'd	have gladly broken my own rule but habit was too strong.	7.103006651977239
17656. hey! her voice was flat and dull.	9.060328853487057
17657. but those penetrating eyes-	i had to turn my head away.	10.146310247505896
17658. it was then that i saw what the drawn-back	covers revealed.	15.452330875043582
17659. there were bloodspots on the sheet.	16.315737630500042
17660. your period?	18.793651446732213
17661.    she	shook	her head.	12.292407525564322
17662. i been spotting a little now and then she said quietly	no emotion in her voice.	9.131559381411014
17663. have you spoken to a doctor	about it?	12.991167193476459
17664.    once again there was a negative shake.	15.619865491510124
17665. i told	miss groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining	table.	7.332957758629687
17666. better do a papanicolaou i told pete.	10.170610251482085
17667. it was only a	few moments before miss groggins had her in the proper position for	a vaginal but i couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination.	6.9823203783453
17668. pete stood by with a slide and took the smear sent it down to the lab	with a request for the test.	8.601075849317343
17669. that done i told miss groggins to	take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind.	6.283568750166843
17670. i was busy the rest of the day.	20.439892703139428
17671. late in the afternoon i was up on	seven again.	8.780717001597935
17672. one of my private patients was being admitted and i went	in to see her settled.	11.228212448809913
17673. on my way to the elevator i ran into pete.	11.269803831387712
17674. i've got the results on the bancroft smear test he said.	5.521386603555391
17675. there's something there all right.	4.675983334456371
17676. do you want to talk to her doctor?	25.951205538112035
17677.    well- i didn't-	i didn't ever want to see that woman again.	7.403889136941088
17678. but that was	ridiculous of course.	21.387997073060106
17679. we'll do a d and c and	get her permission for a hysterectomy.	4.309796436573057
17680. maybe it's nothing maybe	it's intraepithelial or in situ- can't take any chances.	6.724204827071649
17681. if you can keep her here that long pete said wryly.	12.848826657828814
17682. groggins	tells me she's started badgering already wants to get out.	7.879513779734377
17683. wants to get to her booze i guess.	8.481206103376906
17684. well better see what i can do.	11.114516385928301
17685. we'd been standing	right outside miss bancroft's door and as i went to turn the	knob to enter i was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar.	4.7939709498783944
17686. but she seemed to be dozing and in any case we'd been talking in	low tones.	12.576625271489867
17687. her eyes opened as soon as she heard me though	and once again i felt an inward shiver.	6.291850588050451
17688. i sure can't complain	about the service in this place she said.	9.713745980661573
17689. i just got through seeing	one of you guys.	10.41765113989062
17690. what do you want?	32.209380504046656
17691.  there was something	almost insulting in her tone but i disregarded it.	10.74114804890189
17692. i've	just been talking to dr michelson i said.	8.581436094141479
17693. we'd like	you to have a dilatation and curettage.	6.989227025969057
17694. that's quite minor nothing	to worry about.	5.092274000697261
17695. but we would like your permission to do- that is	to go further if it proves necessary.	8.898445803840774
17696. suppose you let me explain.	12.793248192935202
17697. actually i rather	doubt that we'll have to do this.	9.412014591107095
17698. even if we do you'll be out	of here in a week probably.	15.609751527831824
17699. i was sure that was the difficulty-	she just didn't want to stay here where she couldn't get	to the liquor.	7.003821224528446
17700. i looked at her in amazement.	16.398516126131685
17701. i'd had patients who'd refused surgery before of course but	never one who didn't show in one way or another the reason why.	4.874590330471477
17702. mostly it was fear but this woman's voice didn't tremble and	her hands were still on the coverlet.	6.643215071337043
17703. will you tell me why?	11.371309518294675
17704. 	i asked.	15.594944937291627
17705. she smiled a smile without humor.	9.987973641461945
17706. you shouldn't	tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door	she said.	11.773024459365168
17707. i've got cancer haven't i?	4.830320705807231
17708.  she went on disregarding	my protests.	14.140224473190667
17709. i'm not going to be one of your guinea pigs.	7.6286624491692505
17710. let your pupils learn on someone else doctor.	12.737209949188106
17711. just let me die in	peace.	11.664678099686371
17712. i stared at her almost speechless.	13.93195501835056
17713. her little	speech was totally out of character with the sort of person i thought	she was.	6.597743235151104
17714. even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone.	9.686402124987813
17715. this	was someone who'd come down in the world i thought.	9.366921697751529
17716. a long	long way down.	14.946256396843756
17717. again there was something familiar about her something	h   you haven't got cancer i said as strongly	as i could.	5.438541781619698
17718. i don't know what you heard that would make you	think so but i assure you i don't even know myself so how can	you be so sure?	5.4763822734639165
17719.  and even if-   don't give me a lot	of talk joe.	9.183900460861985
17720. she could have found out	my first name of course- that wouldn't be difficult.	9.289225517352772
17721. but there	was that something some echo in the way she spoke h   she was	watching me intently a funny little half-smile on her lips.	6.465749365770404
17722. surprised	baby?	19.804021762487697
17723.  guess i've changed haven't i?	8.254441635698543
17724.  but you haven't	changed much joe.	20.041715074398393
17725. i knew then knew with a heart-stopping	shock.	11.478369277590689
17726. alice- i stammered through dry lips.	9.670406878971576
17727. alice	for goodness sake-   alice she echoed mockingly.	7.14162538120728
17728. what's	the matter joe you scared of me?	9.060328853487057
17729.  think i'm going	to make you introduce a drunk as your wife?	6.771127846432057
17730.  well don't worry.	18.126823107132473
17731. just	let me outta here-   but why did you come back?	6.6920336456407865
17732. 	i'd found my voice.	11.568363037656766
17733. where have you been all these years?	8.716510727165542
17734. 	she shrugged.	15.594944937291627
17735. as for coming back here-	well i'll tell you the truth i didn't even know where i was when	i came to.	6.8027834073047115
17736. the last thing i remember is a bar in san diego-	the way she spoke her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout	made me shudder.	7.336882402940375
17737. and this was gladdy's mother!   i	never asked you for any favors joe she went on but i'm	asking one now.	6.917644541082539
17738. let me outta here! you doctors are all alike-	all you want is to cut up people and what's the good?	7.640622097254872
17739.  no i want	out joe!   i looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before	me.	7.211471997118294
17740. let her out let her out- that would be the solution wouldn't	it?	11.480514555494336
17741.  what she'd said was true- in all these years she'd	never asked for anything from me.	6.374930091531647
17742. if i let her go she'd disappear	once more.	14.783495810265471
17743. and gladdy would be safe!	i was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea.	9.447167606242754
17744. her dark cool caresses were sweeter than any woman's;	the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one-	the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me	but the air i breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic.	5.9604142550402965
17745. yielding-mediterranean-woman-flesh-of-water	she soothed me and drew me deeper into her.	6.460370037324521
17746. i no longer knew how deep i was somewhere under 230 feet	getting drunker happier and more contented by the second.	7.41169861775994
17747. the reasons	for this dive seemed foolish now.	9.454794748865085
17748. only the dive itself had any meaning.	13.314912320072697
17749. the metal-tasting nitrogen made me wonder if i should remove	the mouthpiece	and suck in the sweet water.	6.374177419473055
17750. perhaps if i took off the	aqua-lung i could swim better love my woman better.	8.085051849983051
17751. i chuckled aloud	and the mouthpiece fell out.	9.95288923829895
17752. while a hazy part of my mind	concentrated on swimming down a clear part sorted over recent events	among them my only positive act in a long time.	7.183378528152052
17753. it was when i packed	up what duds i had and went to paris.	10.114227199600231
17754. it was no vacation just me	getting out after a bellyfull.	14.578228310276964
17755. i knew it wouldn't be the same.	13.398514068525884
17756. wild	kicks never are but i hoped to dig up a better frame of mind.	7.468712200669318
17757. once before i had been to paris long before i married valery.	7.668513122689851
17758. that first time was good and it stuck with me.	10.504145099490504
17759. i was twenty-one back	then in the army and fog put our plane down at orly instead of	rhine-main.	7.6270957276481175
17760. it was a saturday evening in april with a mist-like rain	and i was a little high on the good taste of life.	10.862184975453024
17761. i had a pocketful	of money which was unusual when i was in the army and the plane	would be grounded all night.	8.58098053613431
17762. in less than an hour i had gotten a	hotel showered shaved and was out on the champs elysees in a fresh	uniform.	8.82196709015072
17763. i felt like a hun in rome.	9.95288923829895
17764. all the women were	beautiful	and the men were equal to them; everything was glamorous to	my dazzled eyes.	8.960243031991713
17765. there were some sweet machines other than women:	an old bugatti a lean farina coachwork on an american chassis a swallow	a type 540-k mercedes and lots more.	6.16382987370922
17766. there was the arc	de triomphe and the tour d'eiffel- i was no yokel but i was	young and this was paris!   i had champagne at maxim's	then went into a cafe called the jour et nuit to ask the way to montmartre.	7.906319556475118
17767. i met claire which was better.	10.981588546931944
17768. she was	eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could and washing	it down with red wine.	7.5718671376870725
17769. i didn't know a human could feed	so fast and still be beautiful.	5.999126263590009
17770. she was blonde and young and nice	and round in a tight white dress.	9.36901727689114
17771. maybe her ravenous eating wasn't	grotesque because she was so positive about it.	6.509287682983672
17772. when she had	drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill she came directly	to my table and said:   handsome soldier i have assuaged	one hunger with food.	7.8286115926059665
17773. i feel another of terrible urgency.	12.499679017771939
17774. is your evening	free?	24.313294156955255
17775.    madame i said with noblesse oblige because	of the handsome- yeah.	6.210871206873012
17776. and so off we went	to her apartment.	14.174557109683544
17777. she was a nymphomaniac of course the poor girl.	11.841982239786933
17778. toward	the break of day i waxed philosophical and drew analogies about	her way of eating bread and cheese.	6.643215071337043
17779. now it was nine years later	and it wasn't spring but winter when i returned.	7.113771001725556
17780. i got	there on a saturday evening.	13.93195501835056
17781. i made the mistake of going to the jour	et nuit.	9.62818934030181
17782. the place was busy but i didn't feel like a hun.	9.607933015335522
17783. i	sat waiting for life to come along and sweep me up.	6.002446559592496
17784. i had part of a	bottle of french beer called panther pils then switched	to tuborg.	9.645233468707287
17785. after a few hours life hadn't showed and i was crocked.	11.9535399284431
17786. i went to my hotel and slept.	13.884008182142141
17787. the next morning a little cognac	made me feel better- but what can you do in paris on sunday morning?	6.110694482666515
17788. 	so i drank more cognac.	10.472119682746735
17789. all that day and monday i	drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space.	6.812999093335208
17790. i read the tropic	of capricorn and the tropic of cancer.	10.227318669010717
17791. that's what was on my mind.	4.3033852220845334
17792. i was turning over the idea of a good	debauchery when i dozed off.	12.417390804400794
17793. i felt better tuesday evening	when i woke up.	9.169644675936961
17794. my head was clear my thinking sober and i was reconciled	to this paris idea as a flop on top of all my others.	7.729850282319437
17795. a good	binge has that kind of therapeutic value.	8.023923068000494
17796. sometime earlier	the weather had turned cold and it was snowing.	9.20884049815771
17797. i went out into it.	12.384361145835424
17798. i walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until i found a park	and i sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came	from the sky.	7.34935192810821
17799. there was dignity and beauty in the little white flakes	falling through the blue night.	9.002029935930091
17800. i had on only a topcoat but i wasn't	cold.	12.694378815185166
17801. pretty soon a woman came along	carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick.	5.746472650554231
17802. she saw me and sat	down beside me three feet away.	9.557448030765887
17803. suddenly i understood why she had	the umbrella.	8.656836902049417
17804. it gave her poise and posture.	16.49084636425047
17805. without it she would have	been drab and limp.	7.454173545246305
17806. it gave her the right	to sit down beside me back straight one hand out on the handle.	9.451561199049534
17807. i	couldn't imagine her without it.	8.254441635698543
17808. i knew all about her.	18.703116319546275
17809. she was another	human being and happened to be a hustler.	10.322407872716928
17810. i didn't much care if	she were there or not.	8.017966470243751
17811. after a while she said with sort of an	unuttered laugh you have snow in your hair and ears.	7.321885100700919
17812. hardly glancing at her i smiled a bleak	one which said thanks baby but i'd rather be alone.	7.322457929711272
17813. she	was silent for a while then said why are you so unhappy?	6.691326278414752
17814. 	i'm not unhappy i lied staring at the snow.	8.196044167676531
17815. she was	trying to make a hole in my armor and i didn't want it.	6.7914996009666195
17816. is it a woman?	25.28301775737043
17817.  she asked gently.	23.0547882925987
17818. she must have seen the ring	on my left hand.	12.088822304343054
17819. well- women and unhappiness go together	i observed profoundly adding you can wager your derriere on	that.	5.427950274147271
17820. ah monsieur it is not my business to wager it	h   this took me so funny i had to look at her.	8.305979594899352
17821. i felt my	frozen sad face crumble and i grinned a silly one i couldn't have	helped.	6.5779768796623195
17822. i even snorted a chuckle.	15.711603260075847
17823. she smiled at me but it	was an awfully sad smile.	7.533469760296565
17824. she was even more miserable than me.	13.614395752791543
17825. her eyes	were smiling too but so sadly and there was tiredness and infinite	wisdom in them.	6.781245698092385
17826. now isn't it better to smile?	12.13489043233157
17827.  she asked.	19.287214484918096
17828. because i liked this sad person so much i said will	you have a drink with me?	8.398564335291097
17829.    i could see the ancient cynicism	reinforce itself in her eyes and i wondered how many men she had picked	up with this same gambit.	6.850009843561704
17830. anyway i pulled a bottle of	remy martin out of my topcoat drew the cork and passed it to her.	6.82634608532905
17831. i could see she was shocked.	16.207843770215003
17832. i'm sorry i haven't	got a glass i said.	5.047630932330972
17833. non non she said taking the	bottle not for that be sorry.	6.002446559592496
17834. she tilted up and drank	and then i drank.	10.749202706058774
17835. it's really rotten to drink good cognac like	that but i hadn't cared before.	3.0598239485149787
17836. i wasn't going to lug around a	glass.	10.586057419987155
17837. there wasn't much light in the blue dark but i could	see her well.	7.879734401926454
17838. no child this tart she must have been thirty-five or	even forty.	10.579595154424238
17839. somehow she was attractive.	10.239544317116264
17840. not	good looking but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive.	9.472797605583995
17841. i liked her and all at once i was glad she was there.	7.918702782505681
17842. we	finished the bottle- i hadn't had a lot out of it earlier- not	speaking much to each other and we stayed sober.	8.427997634276359
17843. i suppose	we were cold but we didn't feel it.	8.555241096529764
17844. we seemed to be drowsing sadly	soberly in the cold cold air while the snow fell.	11.493087317650293
17845. then she said	allons and we got up and went to my hotel without another word.	7.234928804571701
17846. i sensed no stranger in her.	13.93195501835056
17847. we undressed and made love with	the comfortable acceptance i had once known with valery.	6.6981788258569415
17848. i decided	thirty-five was the best estimate of her age.	12.244429301527019
17849. she had a funny little	scar on her stomach on the left side.	9.331428309164144
17850. i think we were very	tired for we awoke at the same moment deeply rested surprised to	see the late morning sun on the windows which were wet where the rime	had melted.	8.281994663586115
17851. i felt wonderful the absolute opposite of last night's	melancholy.	8.555241096529764
17852. i was hungry as a wolf and	my body felt lean and vital.	10.501183772838814
17853. bon jour i said brightly	sitting up which pulled the covers to her hips.	5.674295354649883
17854. she looked good with	her short tousled hair and no make-up.	9.557448030765887
17855. maybe closer to thirty i	thought.	10.053899942483259
17856. bon jour! she exclaimed smiling.	10.472119682746735
17857. j'ai	faim! yeah but breakfast first.	8.254441635698543
17858. with a laugh she	beat me to the bathroom.	14.980741010587566
17859. i called downstairs for food and a toothbrush	for her.	8.555241096529764
17860. she came out pink from a hot bath and i gave her my robe.	8.171394947443085
17861. i had brushed my teeth showered shaved and dressed by the time a	waiter wheeled in breakfast.	8.061664567255491
17862. the toothbrush monsieur he	said presenting it.	12.435529358277208
17863. i gave it to the woman.	13.333729310558223
17864. what is this	for?	28.376061098518285
17865.  she asked innocently.	23.0547882925987
17866. why to brush your teeth.	13.663388853342104
17867. but i already have! i used yours.	12.800672623818418
17868. oh?	19.804021762487697
17869. 	i said with round eyes.	8.254441635698543
17870. i wondered if i ought to go use the new	one myself.	11.134403246290539
17871. but i smelled the coffee and thinking what the hell	live dangerously i decided i would scald my worries away.	6.843569561789576
17872. the coffee	wasn't very hot though made in a filter pot but it was good.	9.088484996163114
17873. we sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham hot	hard-boiled eggs and hot garlic bread.	5.8950234212887205
17874. as we ate we talked.	20.10376627987504
17875. her name	was suzanne and mine stephen.	8.820367666516145
17876. we sat back comfortably on	the bed with our last cups of coffee.	9.14533409550713
17877. you are very tactful	do you know stephen she remarked.	10.329468918909992
17878. yes because you didn't run off to use that	new toothbrush.	9.10405532370228
17879. i raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror.	10.383105420908851
17880. i didn't really use yours she went on.	8.379631367495245
17881. i carry	one in my purse.	12.384361145835424
17882. i know men never kiss les putains.	15.092987263869851
17883. to	my immense relief she changed the subject in the next sentence:	shall we go to the louvre today?	6.404802967747637
17884.    all right.	23.646246456907814
17885. i	said with enthusiasm at the idea.	7.622507342753323
17886. i put	aside my empty cup.	15.711603260075847
17887. she smiled all the way to her wise sad eyes and	drained her own.	9.661914035152233
17888. what is this	from?	28.376061098518285
17889.  i asked touching the scar on her stomach.	11.095814722239387
17890. it was like a	long thin line drawn through a pink circle.	13.603200809190614
17891. the cynicism was back in her eyes a bitter wisdom and i	wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all.	5.693020623709879
17892. she understood sex	anyway and played at it well.	10.749202706058774
17893. we went to the louvre for a	few hours then by metro to a cabaret in montmartre.	7.332525037175403
17894. it was	a nice place not filled with smoke.	13.839416015349261
17895. we had champagne and steamed mussels.	12.74379530505044
17896. the sommelier brought the wine first a magnum instead of	the bottle i had ordered.	8.086542342015262
17897. he must have thought i was a tourist.	11.871028308611661
17898. i fixed him with a steely eye and said what's this for?	9.774418692065755
17899. 	i didn't ask for a jeroboam of champagne.	6.764147616291221
17900. i thought that	was pretty humorous but i didn't laugh.	11.640490595726106
17901. two letters had arrived for miss theresa stubblefield: she	put them in her bag.	6.2580004841712125
17902. she would not stop to read them in american	express as many were doing sitting on benches or leaning against the	walls but pushed her way out into the street.	7.436065183957549
17903. this was her first	day in rome and it was june.	10.45637074739187
17904. an enormous sky of the most delicate	blue arched overhead.	10.49051482913221
17905. in her mind's eye- her imagination responding	fully almost exhaustingly to these shores' peculiar powers	of stimulation- she saw the city as from above telescoped on its	great bare plains that the ruins marked aqueducts and tombs here a cypress	there a pine and all around the low blue hills.	4.754341450052732
17906. pictures in	old latin books returned to her: the appian way today the colosseum	the arch of constantine.	7.291099421959573
17907. she would see them looking just as	they had in the books and this would make up a part of her delight.	7.964962858035207
17908. moreover nursing various stubblefields- her aunt then her mother	then her father- through their lengthy illnesses	theresa had had a chance	to read quite a lot.	7.142268564515471
17909. england france germany switzerland and	italy had all been rendered for her time and again and between the	prescribed hours of pills and tonics she had conceived a dreamy passion	by lamplight to see all these places with her own eyes.	4.842247685959731
17910. the very	night after her father's funeral she had thought though never admitted	to a soul: now i can go.	6.501492541244375
17911. there's nothing to stop me now.	4.570509116585362
17912. so here it was here was italy anyway and terribly noisy.	9.285343480793545
17913. in the street the traffic was really frightening.	12.80467176105073
17914. cars taxis buses	and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length	of it or swerving perilously around a fountain.	6.365727389270327
17915. shoals of tourists went	by her in national groups- english school girls in blue uniforms	german boys with cameras attached smartly dressed americans looking	in shop windows.	4.863464525326451
17916. glad to be alone theresa climbed the splendid outdoor	staircase that opened to her left.	7.032105024464237
17917. something special was going on here just now- the annual display of	azalea plants.	6.1644733468853214
17918. she had heard about it the night before at her hotel.	12.955155275214087
17919. it was not yet complete: workmen were unloading the potted plants	from	a truck and placing them in banked rows on the steps above.	7.467895353797475
17920. the azaleas	were as large as shrubs and their myriad blooms many still tight	in the bud ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to	the palest pink along with many white ones too.	6.447576825203205
17921. marvelous thought	theresa climbing in her portly well-bred way for she was someone	who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to	notice everything.	5.0508150870404735
17922. in rome all over europe she intended to move very	slowly indeed.	9.850579500826207
17923. halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat	down.	6.764147616291221
17924. other people were doing it too sitting all along the wide banisters	and leaning over the parapets above watching the azaleas mass	or just enjoying the sun.	6.306690031503224
17925. theresa sat with her letters in her lap	breathing mediterranean air.	6.210871206873012
17926. the sun warmed her as it seemed to be	warming everything perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill	insides of churches.	8.318217961524011
17927. she loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette.	7.953336273174813
17928. content h excited; how could you be both at once?	7.879513779734377
17929.  strange	but she was.	10.363724110347151
17930. presently she picked up the first of the letters.	17.816005376719083
17931. a few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted	with anxiety and dismay.	7.227779525644711
17932. of course one of them would have	to go and do this! poor cousin elec she thought tears rising	to sting in the sun but why couldn't he have arranged to live	through the summer?	7.523255725338832
17933.  and how on earth did i ever get this letter anyway?	8.289399698198068
17934. 	she had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had	managed to find her.	7.198778874655976
17935. her cousin emma carraway had written it in her	loose high old lady's script- t's carefully crossed but	l's inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope.	4.8739623240901935
17936. cousin	emma had simply put miss theresa stubblefield rome italy	on the envelope had walked up to the post office in tuxapoka alabama	and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday	card to her next-door neighbor.	7.949908206832585
17937. somebody	had scrawled american express piazza di spagna?	7.14162538120728
17938.  across the	envelope and now theresa had it all as easily as if she had been	the	president of the republic or the pope.	7.41770405132448
17939. inside were all the things	they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness death	and	burial of cousin alexander carraway.	5.459112586289215
17940. cousin emma and cousin	elec brother and sister- unmarried devoted aging- had lived	next door to the stubblefields in tuxapoka from time immemorial until	the stubblefields had moved to montgomery fifteen years ago.	5.830388127029086
17941. two days before he was taken sick cousin elec was out worrying about	what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas and cousin elec had	always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a mother-of-pearl	paper	knife which theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised	she could have when he died.	5.55113798742145
17942. i'm supposed to care as much now	as then as much here as there she realized with a sigh.	4.896974283486748
17943. this letter	would have got to me if she hadn't even put rome italy on	it.	6.89773816862575
17944. she refolded the letter replaced it in its envelope	and turned with relief to one from her brother george.	7.39595678659273
17945. but alas	george when he had written had only just returned from going	to tuxapoka to cousin elec's funeral.	7.542434650481444
17946. he was full of heavy family	reminiscence.	18.80617950098996
17947. all the fine old stock was dying out look at the world	today.	9.086161282611428
17948. his own children had suffered from the weakening of those	values which he and theresa had always taken for granted and as for	his grandchildren he shuddered	to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them	at all.	6.587248663586344
17949. a life of gentility and principle such as cousin elec had lived	had to be known at first hand h.	5.970688311006836
17950. poor george! the only	boy the family darling.	9.97432918100716
17951. together with her mother both of them tense	with worry lest things should somehow go wrong.	6.176700683472421
17952. theresa had seen	him through the right college into the right fraternity and though	pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls safely married to	the right sort however much in the early years of that match his wife	anne had not seemed to understand poor george.	6.387437545020524
17953. could it just be	theresa wondered that anne had understood only too well and that	george all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was	dull?	6.4708785014390156
17954.    as for cousin alexander carraway the only thing	theresa could remember at the moment about him	was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night	about one o'clock in the morning the whole stubblefield family had	been aroused to go next door at cousin emma's call- first papa	then mother then theresa and george.	6.826668584673604
17955. there they all did their	uttermost to help cousin elec get a cramp out of his foot.	7.817453481157195
17956. he had	hobbled downstairs into the parlor in his agony and was sitting wrapped	in his bathrobe on a footstool.	7.6557099336907095
17957. he held his long clenched foot	in both hands and this and his contorted face- he was trying heroically	not to cry out- made him look like a large skinny old monkey.	5.652541073381565
17958. they	all surrounded him the family circle theresa and george as solemn	as if they were watching the cat have kittens and cousin emma	running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming	into a white enamelled pan.	6.02604291340905
17959. can you think of anything to do?	11.135381336842514
17960. 	she kept repeating.	13.148092146312546
17961. i hate to call the doctor but if this keeps	up i'll just have to! can you think of anything to do?	6.609740764416828
17962. 	you might treat it like the hiccups said papa.	8.196044167676531
17963. drop a cold	key down his back.	7.9201928392397045
17964. i just hope this happens to you someday	said cousin elec who was not at his best.	8.756377237271671
17965. poor cousin elec	george said.	10.406798609293578
17966. he was younger than theresa: she remembered looking	down and seeing his great round eyes while at the same time she was	dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused.	8.628702464087151
17967. now here they both were still the same george	full of round-eyed woe and cousin emma in despair.	6.232310596790208
17968. theresa shifted	to a new page.	10.472119682746735
17969. of course	there are practical problems to be considered.	9.151589149381694
17970. cousin emma is alone	in that big old house and won't hear to parting from it.	6.886249538313906
17971. robbie	and beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them	and anne and i have told her she's more than welcome here but	i think she feels that she might be an imposition especially as long	as our rosie is still in high school.	4.7963334497740115
17972. the other possibility is to	make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher	of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that tuxapoka	is populated with- miss edna whittaker for example.	7.689886694039849
17973. but there	is more in this than meets the eye.	9.681549986083473
17974. a new bathroom would certainly	have to be put in.	11.589599136657617
17975. the wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling	off h.	9.266243733094392
17976. i hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write	me about them.	10.539646375560388
17977. i may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer	and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together	the best h.	6.496610726879694
17978. i really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette	so early in the day thought theresa it always makes me sick.	9.849693565155286
17979. i'll	start sneezing in a minute sitting on these cold steps.	6.210871206873012
17980. she got	up standing uncertainly for a moment then moving aside to let go past	her talking a group of young men.	8.936384852721408
17981. they wore shoes with pointed toes	odd to american eyes and narrow trousers and their hair looked	unnaturally black and slick.	5.806893583481489
17982. yet here they were obviously thought to	be handsome and felt themselves to be so.	7.92047027235636
17983. just then a man approached	her with a tray of cheap cameos parker fountain pens rosaries papal	portraits.	6.117777704163886
17984. no no! she said.	15.374207938596363
17985. the	man did not wish to leave.	8.527741659616877
17986. he knew how to spread himself against the	borders of the space that had to separate them.	9.408884026538093
17987. carrozza rides in	the park the colosseum by moonlight he specialized h.	6.002446559592496
17988. theresa turned	away to escape and climbed to a higher landing where the steps	divided in two.	7.138440969068146
17989. there she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant	section of banister while the vendor picked himself another well-dressed	american lady carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag	ascending the steps alone.	5.72396583719482
17990. was he ever successful theresa wondered.	11.812339332972835
17991. the lady with the alligator bag registered interest doubt then indignation;	at last alarm.	6.578982329721101
17992. she cast about as though looking for a policeman:	this really shouldn't be allowed! finally she scurried	away up the steps.	7.536772308535118
17993. theresa stubblefield still holding the	family letters in one hand realized that her whole trip to europe was	viewed in family circles as an interlude between cousin elec's	death and doing something about cousin emma.	4.86107206478141
17994. they were even	anne and george probably thinking themselves very considerate in not	hinting that she really should cut out one or two countries	and come home in august to get cousin emma's house ready before the	teachers came to tuxapoka in september.	6.425820823481441
17995. of course it wasn't anne	and george's fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another	and weren't they always emphasizing that they really didn't	know what they would do without theresa?	5.913800708786282
17996.  the trouble is theresa	thought that while everything that happens there is supposed to	matter supremely nothing here is supposed even to exist.	7.51456289543665
17997. they would	not care if all of europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow.	7.007741476838073
17998. it	never registered with them that i had time to real all of balzac dickens	and stendhal while papa was dying not to mention everything	in the city library after mother's operation.	7.188503959237691
17999. it would have been	exactly the same to them if i had read through all twenty-six volumes	of elsie dinsmore.	9.580636081949372
18000. she arranged the letters carefully one	on top of the other.	11.209642837078773
18001. then with a motion so suddenly violent that she	amazed herself she tore them in two.	6.415988274754477
18002. signora?	19.804021762487697
18003. 	she became aware that two italian workmen carrying a large azalea	pot were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could	begin arranging a new row of the display.	4.982118926136814
18004. mi diapiace	signora ma h insomma h.	9.670406878971576
18005. oh h put it there!	she indicated a spot a little distance away.	6.404562209326707
18006. i knew it as surely as everybody in westfield- that lucille	was a husband stealer.	11.399707322029785
18007. you can't keep that kind of information quiet	in a town of only 4000-plus.	5.929618084281545
18008. and i've been told that just about	every town no matter what its size has its lucille warren.	8.35296314010345
18009. just as it has its susan dolan though nobody'd ever bothered to	tell me that.	9.533515582452859
18010. they even talked about	lucille down at the young christians' league where i spent	a lot of time in bible classes and helping out with the office work	for our foreign mission.	6.859306152463605
18011. i never heard my folks talk about her though.	9.821732468923537
18012. they were good-living religious people and i can truthfully say	i never heard them spread any gossip about anybody.	8.013100521817549
18013. even if they ever	did say anything about people like lucille warren i know they wouldn't	have dreamed of saying it in front of me.	7.612565204605872
18014. my folks and my faith	protected me from things like that.	8.5969447579045
18015. and so i was really upset	the first time i discovered that my boy friend johnnie was seeing	mrs warren.	7.677297265180811
18016. i asked him about it one night while we were sitting	in his truck.	11.196385358381727
18017. i asked him if it was true.	17.814061229543956
18018. he gave me a straight	honest answer.	19.287009670718447
18019. look sue baby he'd said.	12.50213707625067
18020. much as i	love you- well a guy's a guy and lucille's willing to-	to come across.	8.22122337004559
18021. honest kitten that's all it is- i don't even	like lucille much.	6.002446559592496
18022. i guess it was at that moment that i	realized what i was up against in the person of lucille warren.	9.065006481749224
18023. but	it didn't seem fair.	11.59959732049716
18024. my love for johnnie was young and clean-	how could i possibly compete with a woman like that who didn't hesitate	to use her sex.	6.683870728523498
18025. johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber	outfit in a town about twenty miles away and he was also pretty good	at anything in the carpentry line.	6.176712769567081
18026. it was a vivid sharp february	morning that johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard bringing	some stuff dad had ordered.	9.244302527801475
18027. i wasn't in the habit of batting	my eyes at delivery men but the moment i saw johnnie i knew he was	different.	5.500198106370456
18028. he wasn't only different- he was it.	12.411802052220429
18029. he had an	easy masculine grace about him the kind that kids don't have but	that i had sometimes admired in other older men.	6.116572042707712
18030. his smile was quick	and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp.	7.242188230830913
18031. the most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he	seemed interested in me too.	7.888376441049139
18032. i could hardly believe such	good luck was mine.	13.487365811251081
18033. and now lucille warren had gotten a look	at him.	9.239731767266347
18034. i guess she was between affairs or something but anyway she	had set her sights on johnnie my johnnie.	7.721756160345477
18035. i didn't	like it one bit.	12.384361145835424
18036. but what could i do?	22.454724570423792
18037.  a man had to have his release-	at least that's what the boys used to say in high school- and	i wasn't providing it for johnnie.	6.449025335435814
18038. she	wouldn't have even if he'd asked her.	9.060328853487057
18039. but he wouldn't	ask her- he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit	to him against her will.	6.969289670820706
18040. and he wouldn't leave her either- he'd	told me that.	12.219567014295409
18041. he was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and	leave those helpless children without their daddy.	7.21832396059985
18042. johnnie	loved me and wanted me.	10.472119682746735
18043. but the only love i was giving him was the	pure kind.	9.310008802305518
18044. it was weeks before we even kissed for the first time.	15.137787097479183
18045. against my folks'	wishes we'd been seeing each other for short rides in the truck.	6.335090789657119
18046. the rides were tame enough- mostly we talked.	10.582206877639416
18047. but by the time the	first crackling of spring came around we both knew we were hopelessly	in love.	8.517624550477853
18048. yet even then we did nothing much but talk and maybe neck	a little.	9.81594016844098
18049. it's so crazy i told him once.	3.574989767277945
18050. i always	imagined i would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like	that.	8.923469128060672
18051. and you	fall for a lumber jockey.	10.242612813271945
18052. who drinks far too much.	13.914630479694948
18053. and i was ticking off	the items on my fingers swears too much and goes out with the boys	whoever they are too much and who never goes to church	and won't even listen when i try to persuade him to come back to the	fold.	5.482104079398595
18054. he examined his nails carefully.	15.385132030882776
18055. i could walk	out the door.	15.08379379512986
18056. and never	show my face or my truck around here again.	9.73086604464448
18057. he still wasn't looking	at me.	12.99784219403056
18058. or i could visit	lucille warren.	12.833041965406032
18059. he shrugged noncommittally.	16.99478977991575
18060. and	now he was seeing her.	10.73634014612502
18061. he'd just admitted it to me.	7.622507342753323
18062. i huddled	miserably beside him in the truck.	15.387374944414505
18063. it was all my doing- his	seeing her.	16.01311191492744
18064. johnnie and i had been innocent in our love and that was	the way i wanted to keep it.	7.359786578411542
18065. at first johnnie hadn't understood-	how could he not being a religious person like me?	7.4107014106524804
18066.  but then	he had said all right kid if that's how you want it that's	how it'll be.	8.80918415531882
18067. but what had i done trying to keep us pure?	10.133091185569643
18068. 	i had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman.	8.080354888363697
18069. i had just	the same as delivered him into the hands of the devil!   so	one week later i surrendered to him in the little motel on route	10.	8.597417441240692
18070. i was desperate to hold him to give him whatever	in this world he wanted or needed and to keep him from the clutches	of lucille warren.	8.294096164888652
18071. and though at the time i blushed	to admit it even to myself there was in me a growing desire a sexual	awareness that johnnie had set in motion an awareness that no other	man had ever triggered.	5.71431579981053
18072. i wanted him with a terrifying fierceness.	14.614236527667497
18073. astonishingly enough it was my own voice i heard there in the	darkness begging this man to make love to me.	5.265361593691451
18074. i will kitten!   outside in the	summertime	fields behind the motel a thousand crickets serenaded us.	9.502795934909852
18075. will	you always love me this way?	7.622507342753323
18076.    uh huh.	15.594944937291627
18077. and i snuggled closer to the man l loved.	14.140453682961244
18078. it was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced.	11.455245618923785
18079. i had had no wedding ceremony no witnesses no certificate of marriage	but i had all the joy that goes with them.	7.0853003197176445
18080. johnnie	h?	19.804021762487697
18081.    it can't be wrong can it?	12.998584141589314
18082.  not really.	24.557957404011628
18083. johnnie rose on one elbow.	8.254441635698543
18084. it's never wrong	if love is real.	3.7110521007927275
18085. i took great comfort from his words	and smiled to myself in the darkness.	7.033748404049442
18086. idiot's delight i later discovered.	10.472119682746735
18087. i felt no conflict	between what i was doing and my strict religious upbringing.	7.033748404049442
18088. i had	always resisted the passes made at me by other kids and many times	i had thought about my love for johnnie who being thirty brought a	maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about.	6.226393231944687
18089. i had also thought a lot about how god must look on true love and so	in a way i was keeping my promise to god my promise to remain pure	until i was married.	5.715313143521816
18090. i was practically a bride after all.	14.894590857967684
18091. there would have been a ceremony if it had been possible.	15.115733738279404
18092. of this i had no doubt.	19.233308868905468
18093. wouldn't johnnie do practically anything	in the world to insure my happiness?	5.719608753571625
18094.  of course he would.	26.85286408234465
18095. he'd	not only told me so he'd proved it.	6.764147616291221
18096. it wasn't johnnie's fault	that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did	her best to make his life unbearable.	8.17545691823206
18097. just because he was honorable	enough to want to continue supporting his two children as any decent	man would that was no reason he should be denied his own small share	of happiness too.	5.849354800583104
18098. and if i could contribute to that i'd do it.	14.67317734953822
18099. no price is too high when true love is at stake.	6.985638126001336
18100. and i had no doubts about how true this love was.	12.067976316560367
18101. i'd	never even petted with a boy and after i met johnnie he never touched	me for the longest while not until i all but threw myself at him.	4.6904158433825796
18102. he was plenty attentive all right but he behaved like a gentleman	and i figured that emotionally i was closer to his age than to	my own eighteen and a half.	7.403356913574332
18103. what could a mere twelve years matter?	10.221825396187453
18104. 	it wasn't i was sure a difference in age that came between people	but a difference in maturity.	8.023901015885288
18105. and hadn't i rescued him from	lucille warren?	9.342113951872065
18106.  she'd have gotten him if i hadn't stopped	her.	8.581436094141479
18107. after all lucille warren was a husband-stealer from way	back.	9.498088477107476
18108. but i'd been a good girl and now god was blessing	me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we	shared.	8.03878752724742
18109. it was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might	bring.	9.996759250554351
18110. always and always johnnie?	11.952165518888542
18111.    always.	15.610129252044759
18112. convention time in boston.	11.9058975878534
18113. a chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow.	8.562350509322087
18114. from	the entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming members	of the young christians' league and i'd been chosen to represent	our chapter.	8.322840996590806
18115. i had mixed emotions about going.	13.461924932958663
18116. i'd been	seeing johnnie almost a year now but i still didn't want to leave	him for five whole days.	5.8493448928655996
18117. but i had looked forward so much to being	with this church group.	8.701500906341561
18118. i hadn't been doing as much work as i used	to in westfield and i felt funny about that and wanted to work harder	than ever.	7.6522737165451895
18119. i wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this	fine group.	7.80233911057633
18120. so i went to boston.	22.330584629054524
18121. the first meeting was	held in faneuil hall a great big place where we were able to meet members	from all the other states.	7.113143947739919
18122. my cousin alma at whose home i was	staying during the convention introduced me to a group of young people	from rhode island.	7.738961053293599
18123. one of them was a very friendly lovely fellow	named ronald a boy about my age with slick blond hair and dancing	blue eyes.	8.103890594212462
18124. he looked very different from johnnie- in fact he looked	sort of like me.	10.418435513015963
18125. i thought so and he mentioned it and alma said	so too.	8.135414724433678
18126. after the meeting there was going to be a party at	someone's house.	14.752858607261347
18127. i assumed alma would get me there but in the confusion	of the meeting breaking up we were separated.	6.751236285530815
18128. outside the hall	i anxiously looked around for her then all at once there was a	hand on my elbow.	7.720575835317753
18129. hey there beautiful twin of mine ronald	said.	7.14162538120728
18130. need a pumpkin to get to the party?	13.024014854311561
18131.    i couldn't	help laughing with him.	12.384361145835424
18132. well i should find alma-	i began.	12.107821717729271
18133. by the time we arrived the party was already going strong.	10.716192942662552
18134. a couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and i realized	they were drinking.	10.757258453399926
18135. my folks wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the	house so my first taste	of it had been- of course- with johnnie.	5.279310736414392
18136. i hadn't liked it at first- it was bitter and burning.	9.713745980661573
18137. but when	johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale i enjoyed it.	7.793238909001978
18138. of course	i enjoyed 'most anything if i did it with johnnie.	11.653439749240151
18139. johnnie	h i suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening.	5.898161823557716
18140. but that was only natural i decided; surely he was still resting	snugly in my heart.	10.699589952780414
18141. i don't see alma anywhere	i said.	5.514786625900389
18142. c'mon let's find	out where they're keeping the glasses.	8.581436094141479
18143. i-	i don't think so ronald.	8.254441635698543
18144. aw come	on.	15.594944937291627
18145. but	at least come along while i get lubricated.	6.764147616291221
18146. strange faces most of them and i wasn't even sure	all of them had come from the league meeting.	9.94001133804793
18147. under normal circumstances he had a certain bright-eyed all-american-boy	charm	with great appeal for young ladies old ladies and dogs.	6.300230992619183
18148. today he looked like an astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on	the bureau and spent six months in space: hollow eyes hollow cheeks	hollow stomach.	6.896888396467524
18149. a shot of orange juice would	make everything seem better.	7.563545188002981
18150. he looked around his little eden:	bureau bed table chair two-burner stove.	9.592132658614503
18151. you share a refrigerator mrs kirby had said and somehow	at midnight after the long drive from new york in pelting rain	that had sounded reasonable.	6.621185110768666
18152. in the cold light of day it seemed a lunatic	arrangement.	14.647174191411514
18153. share bath maybe- but share refrigerator?	7.622507342753323
18154.  she	had explained it- something about summer people's eating out and	not enough space in the units.	7.2628435485607765
18155. and where was the thing?	12.693774132123336
18156.  he remembered	seeing it last night when he put away his small store of bachelor-type	eatables.	8.52351370118872
18157. ah yes- his half of a refrigerator stood outside	on the curving veranda between unit number three and unit number	four.	5.272292847138255
18158. it was still raining and mrs kirby's cottages	bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore vivid blue	and green and magenta.	9.317055647266033
18159. charlie downed his orange juice and one of	the long skinny green pills his spirits as damp as the day.	5.083242045036259
18160. this	vacation had seemed like a good idea last week when his doctor had	prescribed it.	8.59443225167528
18161. take a full month the doctor had said.	8.403407694771781
18162. lots	of sun lots of rest.	10.472119682746735
18163. the red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound.	8.976097203071156
18164. this is a sleeping capsule.	27.555925243887035
18165. the others will make you a little more	comfortable until you get it licked.	7.2135768416778685
18166. you young men get to be my age	you won't take flu so lightly.	9.860522734837105
18167. charlie had accepted the	diagnosis without comment.	7.622507342753323
18168. the doctor could call it anything from flu	to beriberi; but charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew	too that there was no pill to cure it.	7.865949447729285
18169. he had loved and lost vivian	wayne to somebody else had watched her marry the somebody else and	had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever which	was really piling it on.	5.22861109463404
18170. he had caught too like an ailment a confirmed	distrust of women.	11.16988868306799
18171. once burned- scalded really because vivian	had given him every encouragement- forever shy.	6.919108887321692
18172. from now on	his was going to be a man's world: the north woods duck blinds	at dawning beer and poker and male secretaries.	8.749346638127436
18173. meanwhile he	had this miserable cold and as he leaned against the refrigerator watching	the rain make sandy puddles at his feet the doctor's prescription	for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery.	5.090355500105485
18174. in these damp circumstances	he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia.	10.715374875612495
18175. he looked	up to see mrs kirby awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted	slicker bearing down on him.	6.884446573441091
18176. three-day blow! she bellowed	triumphantly.	11.568363037656766
18177. he had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard	really filthy weather as a kind of pyhrric victory over the tourists.	8.331783887545436
18178. fine day after tomorrow she added.	9.670406878971576
18179. i hope so	he said.	16.05383250239435
18180. thought i'd bake it out in	the sun.	9.060328853487057
18181. you've got	a peaked look.	5.539895886183769
18182. better get in out of the wet.	14.077825454787035
18183. charlie forbore	to mention that the wet was somewhat universal peony being less	than weatherproof.	5.674295354649883
18184. as for its being fine day after tomorrow he had	the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again with vivian	lost to him forever.	8.263875900162324
18185. he could imagine her at this minute honeymooning	in nassau with what's-his-name lounging on golden sands looking	forward to a life of unalloyed bliss.	6.012784696310228
18186. all charlie could look forward	to was a yellow pill at noon a salami sandwich for lunch and a	lonely old age- if he lived that long.	6.705103621354813
18187. he leafed through the	light reading provided by mrs kirby for her guests: four separate	adventures of the bobbsey twins	and several agricultural	bulletins	on the treatment of hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle hideously	illustrated.	5.55391438101163
18188. he dozed only to dream of vivian and woke only to	crash into the night table bruising his other shin.	7.496552459822804
18189. he took a yellow	pill only to choke on it and went for the salami only to find something	alive in the refrigerator- something pink and fuzzy.	6.128050522925441
18190. his first thought was that mrs kirby in her mania for color had	dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator	door and climb in; but on further investigation the thing proved to	be a sweater of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men's jackets-	pale pale pink and according to the label size thirty-four.	5.9852718261802
18191. he	thought about it for a minute could find no reasonable explanation	for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator got the salami bread	and a bermuda onion and put the whole thing out of his mind.	5.315205345526763
18192. next morning he found a note in the refrigerator.	9.533518726891069
18193. would you	mind wrapping your onion?	11.004706853480066
18194.  said this note.	17.7108913990712
18195. the smell permeates	everything! everything being the sweater a lipstick case and	a squirt bottle of kissin' kare pink hand lotion.	5.961506444001977
18196. the note paper	was pink too and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine.	8.086542342015262
18197. not that he had supposed considering the evidence that he was	sharing this refrigerator with a member of the beach patrol.	9.878482173434339
18198. he scrawled	sorry across the bottom of the note and then against his	better judgment added: don't you eat?	9.823480406145869
18199.  he didn't want	to encourage anything here; but on the other hand he didn't want	her swiping his salami.	6.389099735105381
18200. not onions came the answer the	following day.	13.16572876288734
18201. must have really smelled up her	sweater he thought and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen.	5.549619948983278
18202. but then as he well knew women are not guided by logic	or common sense.	9.476937300310858
18203. now if this were vivian next door to him and if for some obscure	female reason she kept her clothes in the refrigerator they would	not be pink.	5.816465357739164
18204. they would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid chic	and splashy like vivian herself.	11.163681756638251
18205. pink vivian once had told	him	was for baby girls and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously	clinging to their infancy.	5.083242045036259
18206. why does this girl keep a sweater	in the refrigerator?	10.290191559228484
18207.  he mused aloud.	16.99478977991575
18208. eh?	19.804021762487697
18209.  it was	mrs kirby making her toilsome way along the veranda laden with	a clattery collection of mops brushes and pails.	7.164771281185504
18210. what's that	you say?	9.488114765205632
18211.    oh nothing.	15.82425196957161
18212. just glad the rain's stopped.	14.00840206751307
18213. just look at that sky.	11.04184642448208
18214. be a scorcher by afternoon.	16.469374782788545
18215. i've got this cold.	4.990273077554887
18216. she scrutinized him.	19.344067135409958
18217. you want	to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash first sunny day.	6.838755953429809
18218. i must remember to warn the girl next to you in larkspur.	10.591897686932567
18219. that pale	kind's the worst.	13.51881576711259
18220. that pale kind charlie thought.	14.860954966088402
18221. but then neither was peaked.	14.99177374306145
18222. he could	hear mrs kirby now warning her pale guest against sunburn.	9.592132658614503
18223. i	spoke to the fellow next door too she might say.	6.210871206873012
18224. surely there was a better word.	12.553033618835462
18225. charlie looked	in the mirror.	9.118533821976325
18226. frail	feeble- peaked.	15.594944937291627
18227. clearly two damp days with the bobbsey twins	had done him no good.	6.261864188559015
18228. the sun blazing hot as prophesied was	far from kind to mrs kirby's varicolored properties.	8.750840608424541
18229. when charlie	came up from the beach for his four-o'clock pill the whole establishment	looked like a	floodlit modern painting- great blocks of dizzy color punctuated at	regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators.	5.216441306835459
18230. this weekend he thought he would look around for some more subdued	retreat with cape roses maybe at the door.	7.636206967030689
18231. he could not imagine	a flower's being brave enough to grow beside peony larkspur and	the rest.	7.8967518591202825
18232. the sweater was gone from the refrigerator and in	its place was a large plastic bag full of wet pink clothes.	7.068970569960655
18233. no wonder	she was so pale wearing all those cold clothes.	7.306945388861245
18234. he got a	red pill and a beer and then on impulse transferred the rest of his	salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled be my guest	on the wrapping.	8.676470920683538
18235. it gave him a good feeling.	14.040554417444826
18236. thanks	was her answer the next day.	9.670406878971576
18237. the note was propped against his	pill bottles and bore a postscript: you're not at all well are	you?	7.0519299194784555
18238.    i've got this cold he wrote.	5.970410411927927
18239. not that it	was any of her business.	10.960533574133022
18240. it's none of my business said	the next note but my aunt elsie used to take lemon juice and honey	in hot water for a cold and she lived to be ninety-six.	4.453758789440153
18241. i mean	she's still living and she's ninety-six.	9.95288923829895
18242. why don't you try that?	13.663388853342104
18243. 	i don't have a lemon.	8.254441635698543
18244. he had to write very small	to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper.	15.013589982311851
18245. by the next	morning she had turned the paper over.	8.973123714146022
18246. she didn't sound like a pale girl.	8.599370125360913
18247. she	sounded a little like a redhead.	7.622507342753323
18248. but then redheads are often pale.	16.546019564226082
18249. he stuck his head in mrs kirby's little rental office.	7.953394054598466
18250. i guess that redhead next to me took your advice.	11.04847926446256
18251. i haven't seen	her on the beach.	9.667175810690399
18252. you won't if you're looking for	a redhead.	13.503944917508555
18253. he spent that afternoon	on the beach looking for a pale browny-haired girl in a pink bathing	suit.	6.618904412933556
18254. there were pink bathing suits on blondes and browny-haired	girls in red or black or green bathing suits.	10.891872070206185
18255. there were a sprinkling	of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits.	10.250129959543052
18256. up on	a dune he saw a girl all by herself sitting on a camp stool before	an easel and absorbed in her painting.	7.307110379787894
18257. he paid little attention to her	because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white- one	of those bulky turtle-neck sweaters.	6.087389548120484
18258. on the beach there were pale girls	and not-so-pale girls.	14.020126418616051
18259. and he saw them all as he walked up and down.	9.499236639283918
18260. at two that morning he was still walking- up and down	peony up and down the veranda up and down the silent moonlit beach.	9.723976027711611
18261. finally in desperation he opened the refrigerator filched her hand	lotion and left a note.	6.027225964428403
18262. i've got this sunburn said the note	and i used some of your hand lotion.	5.76331652397025
18263. of course i don't mind she answered.	15.23700759592899
18264. you're	having a miserable time aren't you?	9.670406878971576
18265.  use all the lotion you want	and for goodness' sake stay in out of the sun for a couple of days.	7.903675057560728
18266. this was a very warm sympathetic girl he decided.	14.552062194618355
18267. sympathy	is a fine quality in a woman.	7.14162538120728
18268. now vivian for instance was not	too long on sympathy.	9.759860430032251
18269. she felt and said that sympathy only made people	feel sorry for themselves; it was a tough world and you had to	be tough to hold your own.	5.6728437405755265
18270. he didn't know what was so tough about	vivian's world slopping around nassau with what's-his-name.	6.250528725610024
18271. suppose	what's-his-name got a sunburn?	9.118533821976325
18272.  charlie couldn't see vivian	offering any hand lotion.	9.060328853487057
18273. she might peel him once the worst of the	agony was over.	7.435424790635955
18274. charlie spent the next two days in his pajama	bottoms waiting for the fire in his back to subside and used generous	quantities of the hand lotion.	7.148340273478534
18275. correspondence passed back	and forth.	9.118533821976325
18276. how's your sunburn now?	11.568363037656766
18277.  the only thing this	lotion has glycerin in it and that whitens the skin so if you're	so anxious to get a tan you may not want to use it.	7.130541533452475
18278. i'm	not that anxious but maybe that's why you're so fair.	7.879513779734377
18279. that mrs kirby! i'll bet she told you i was puny too.	7.09355477563453
18280. how's your cold?	13.148092146312546
18281.    broiled out.	12.292407525564322
18282. she didn't say	you were puny.	9.82466777404044
18283. are you?	21.325090088442064
18284.  what's puny?	10.658282670269122
18285.    puny goes	with pale and peaked.	8.254441635698543
18286. do you have anything to read while you're shut	up?	15.285993954488212
18287.  there are two things here about surviving in the wilderness	and a book called 'tom swift and his speedy canoe'; but the	picture of tom swift is pretty sinister.	6.529137136090429
18288. there was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot.	17.76551666989247
18289. the	new riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that	took a hop.	7.440713570591949
18290. for a few innings the anniston team couldn't figure him	out.	12.934683776465631
18291. then in the fifth anniston's kid catcher caught onto a curve	and smacked the ball into left center field.	6.802186920913236
18292. eddie lee riverside's	redheaded playing manager ran after the ball but it rolled	past him.	7.198778874655976
18293. phil rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the	relay.	5.825820622377272
18294. eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to	phil.	8.338773623381888
18295. third! third base! eddie shouted.	8.254441635698543
18296. phil	spun around and made an accurate throw into mike deegan's hands on	third base.	7.198778874655976
18297. mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag.	6.537904474381324
18298. but the anniston boy had begun his slide too late.	11.848480941707242
18299. he came into	the bag with his body and mike deegan brought the ball down full in	his face.	6.446660706320529
18300. you bastard! the anniston catcher screamed.	15.000064054538505
18301. he	jumped to his feet and started to throw punches.	8.304077597384941
18302. mike deegan tossed	his glove away and began to swing at the catcher.	8.351007277100697
18303. this brought in everybody	from both sides while the spectators stood up and added to the	uproar.	6.602047908462229
18304. the fighters were separated in a few minutes.	12.209240842927233
18305. but mike deegan was boiling mad now.	10.19575443707157
18306. when the inning	was over he cursed the anniston catcher all the way into the dugout.	12.04036471716993
18307. phil rossoff coming in from left field stopped at the water	fountain for a drink.	5.86141111402436
18308. mike deegan was standing beside it facing the	field.	8.581436094141479
18309. he was eyeing the anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before	the inning began.	7.966892886463579
18310. keep your eyes open sonny! mike	yelled to the catcher.	9.349635902175994
18311. the anniston	catcher did not reply with words.	8.976097203071156
18312. he simply turned to mike and smiled.	12.411802052220429
18313. this so infuriated deegan that he spun around and said: i'll	get that little bastard.	6.488180278828181
18314. so help me god i'll get him.	11.353952865167347
18315. phil rossoff said: why don't you leave him alone?	6.460370037324521
18316. 	mind your own goddamn business mike deegan said.	8.581436094141479
18317. he stepped into the dugout wondering why deegan	was always looking for trouble.	7.64676287920333
18318. maybe the answer was in his eyes.	12.475030471941214
18319. when	deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips.	6.5186904035548565
18320. in the	last of the sixth inning mike deegan got up to bat and hit a fast	ball over the left fielder's head.	8.950843620014851
18321. by the time the fielder got his	hands on the ball deegan was rounding third base and heading for home.	7.903616866623694
18322. the left fielder threw and it was a good one.	16.017606782895076
18323. but mike had no chance	of being tagged.	10.19575443707157
18324. the anniston catcher was straddling home plate.	11.387658710676023
18325. all deegan had to do was slide fall away but instead he rammed into	the catcher.	7.457345721062782
18326. both fell heavily to the ground.	11.309027686668804
18327. only	mike got to his feet.	8.254441635698543
18328. he went back to touch home plate turned and	walked to the dugout without looking back.	9.768552345939245
18329. the anniston players	and their manager ran out on the field.	8.615573438394106
18330. they poured water over their	catcher's face.	13.133843158043385
18331. then the manager called for a	doctor.	11.471005335590355
18332. the riverside physician came down to look over the injured	ballplayer.	11.354909542278204
18333. then quickly and a little nervously the doctor ordered	a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room.	6.099340514961754
18334. mike deegan was sitting on the bench watching.	10.194454075657898
18335. when the ballplayers	started to carry the catcher off the field he said: that	ought to teach the sonofabitch.	7.997296117526202
18336. phil rossoff seated next	to deegan got up and moved to the other end of the bench.	10.33321092788045
18337. the	anniston manager was coming over to the riverside dugout.	7.588501175397519
18338. he was	followed by four of his men.	13.595844656648401
18339. it began to look as if something was going	to happen.	12.657286249202263
18340. mike sat quitely watching the manager come nearer.	8.581436094141479
18341. eddie	lee moved over to mike deegan's side.	7.14162538120728
18342. no one said a word.	16.941975467163637
18343. the anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of mike.	8.750094238313348
18344. deegan the manager said his	voice pitched low quivering.	8.581436094141479
18345. that was a rotten thing to do.	13.169772580744088
18346. for god's sake mike said waving the manager away.	10.38479854363946
18347. stop it will you?	10.843825299487202
18348.  tell your guys not to block the plate.	9.074972767345402
18349. you didn't have to ram him.	11.823504411807077
18350. the anniston manager looked at eddie lee.	11.387658710676023
18351. it	was a cold and calculated look.	8.37636672701769
18352. he turned and went back across the field	to his dugout.	11.201414030446568
18353. he called in the pitcher who had been pitching and	a big heavy powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound	for anniston.	7.036823693109364
18354. the game started again and in the eighth inning	mike deegan came up to bat.	12.55416991866762
18355. everyone in the ball park seemed to be	standing and shouting.	7.680560062855634
18356. the first ball the hefty pitcher threw	came in for mike's head.	10.31465583485308
18357. deegan fell into the dirt the ball going	over him.	7.567533789706685
18358. he arose slowly and brushed himself off.	12.411802052220429
18359. he got back	into the batter's box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again.	8.019965142109386
18360. hit the bum! somebody yelled from the anniston	bench.	8.581436094141479
18361. in the riverside dugout frankie ricco shortstop whispered	into phil's ear: there's gonna be a fight.	7.5508178076162284
18362. look at those bastards! charlie haydon a pitcher said.	14.613191418375093
18363. mike was slow getting into	the box this time.	6.764147616291221

18407. is this because of what happened out there?	10.105809759967789
18408.    no	eddie said.	15.594944937291627
18409. but it does confirm what i've suspected all along.	11.710974206036632
18410. listen! this is the second time	h   sit down sit down eddie said.	8.751094808679689
18411. i'm not saying	you're yellow.	3.69637106966972
18412. i am saying you're not a professional ballplayer.	13.964033913058554
18413. eddie lee leaned forward over the desk.	7.14162538120728
18414. now listen	to me phil.	15.364229980974233
18415. i'm not steering you wrong.	3.699222138671167

18417. phil shook his head and eddie frowned.	8.677321360753487
18418. suddenly his voice grew hard.	13.248482554738986
18419. what the hell do you think baseball	is?	12.028601476537517
18420.  you're not in the big leagues but if you can't give	and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there?	6.136219794915333
18421. 	phil started to say something but eddie cut him short.	6.531276281853482
18422. now don't tell me what a good ball player you are.	8.859365232996492
18423. i know you've	got talent.	18.393652376116847
18424. but what you haven't got is the heart to back up	that talent with.	9.75885328664092
18425. you just haven't got the heart	for pro-ball and that's it.	8.498258318368384
18426. dazed phil said: i	don't get it.	9.670406878971576
18427. my batting average h   eddie stood up abruptly	then sat down just as abruptly.	6.455031676096331
18428. what difference does your	batting average make?	13.126227377958582
18429.  or your fielding average.	11.46190772864265
18430. or even the way you	run bases.	13.901054241537196
18431. i tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win-	you won't do it.	7.538662819281561
18432. that's what i mean by no heart for the	game.	5.567502951982717
18433. deegan had no business ramming into that	kid out there.	6.460370037324521
18434. he did it because he knows for each guy he puts out	of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on.	8.522148304044958
18435. what the hell do you think baseball is?	10.908448241307822
18436.  a sport?	21.944778634142413
18437.  it's a way of	life goddamit! and you've got	to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody	who want to take your way of life away from you!   he's	wrong! phil thought.	3.7059560077841414
18438. there were	other clubs in this league.	17.252764190159947
18439. he was a little pale	and shaky.	17.239698497176036
18440. his lips felt glued together.	12.214555706636531
18441. i think you're	wrong eddie he said finally.	13.234928082206727
18442. you'll	get your pay in the morning.	9.670406878971576
18443. phil turned and left	the room hearing eddie say: someday you'll see i was right.	5.542917982132687
18444. phil shut the door behind him.	9.670406878971576
18445. outside in the dressing room	frankie	ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes.	6.069352188143241
18446. phil said: i	got my release.	10.472119682746735
18447. what for?	20.454815948573874
18448.    phil sighed.	15.594944937291627
18449. i don't get it.	6.084341628539399
18450. i don't know phil	said.	6.40353114943052
18451. they were silent for a few moments.	12.704666064952725
18452. then frankie said:	what are you gonna do?	11.185419424362621
18453.    phil started to take his clothes	off and frankie sat down on the bench again.	6.21738536436707
18454. phil took off one	shoe and stared at it.	8.581436094141479
18455. don't take it like this frankie	said.	3.3326417997438393
18456. hell plenty of guys get let out and come back later.	7.615092762846159
18457. the	leagues are full of guys like that.	7.738000562449461
18458. what are you gonna do phil?	19.147156018699693
18459.    phil did not answer.	9.118533821976325
18460. why not try another club?	16.50522406137714
18461.    phil looked up.	10.363724110347151
18462. what the hell right did eddie have saying a thing like that?	9.447230487107626
18463. 	springfield's in tomorrow frankie said.	8.254441635698543
18464. he just didn't know what he was talking about	saying a thing like that.	11.024864854286045
18465. will you do it phil?	11.371309518294675
18466. 	do what?	15.594944937291627
18467.    ask whitey for a job.	9.452469300701186
18468. springfield come in tomorrow?	11.568363037656766
18469. 	frankie nodded.	12.292407525564322
18470. i'll talk to him all right.	7.052416632819533
18471. you'll get a job there.	4.434816407143831
18472. i'm not worried about it	phil said.	4.695968624969399
18473. that's the way to talk.	4.5521556521024245
18474. what else did eddie	have to say?	13.126227377958582
18475.    nothing phil said.	12.798393476486735
18476. richard's next interest seemed the product of his insularity.	9.552580660614426
18477. his broad reading took him into certain by-ways of religion and the	subject of religion began to fascinate him.	5.702822383859554
18478. when he was twelve he took	to reading st augustine and aquinas then lao-tse confucius	mencius suzuki hindu tomes by endless krishnaists and numerous	socio-archaeological papers.	8.40886389378838
18479. for his birthday because richard had	seen them in a store and asked for them his mother bought him the zend-avesta	and a little image of the indian god acala.	6.485090509647295
18480. and one	day on her own his mother came home with a present entitled the	book of the dead which she suspected richard would enjoy.	7.587654776625781
18481. he was	enormously happy with her gift and smiled then went to his room to	read.	7.644175402875733
18482. at dinner one night when he was fourteen richard announced	there is only one god.	10.930302944433684
18483. did you think there were	two?	11.726643105254862
18484.  grinned his father.	13.148092146312546
18485. you don't understand	richard said gloomily.	7.132401713521564
18486. through quiet laughter his mother said	don't speak to your father like that richard.	8.132103251395721
18487. richard	seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about	religion again.	4.366709415741732
18488. his interest in the formal study of religion waned	when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in asian	affairs.	8.89554174344502
18489. although he still didn't speak to anyone he grew fond	of saying the future lies in asia when the opportunity arose	and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to new	york to give him a foundation they said for his life in asian studies.	5.275214311400777
18490. richard was a solitary student in new york and acquired	in his remoteness a thorough if bookish knowledge of asian lore	literature life politics and history.	7.307426758709952
18491. he was awarded a fellowship to	continue his studies in tokyo and he packed up his clothes the biwa	upon which he had been practicing and his image of acala and left	to spend a week at home before leaving the country.	5.577159584277038
18492. the week at	home was not comfortable.	15.712826245464647
18493. his mother who had seen little of him for	four years appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an	orient which she herself having slight knowledge of it had to be distrusted.	5.161850294109484
18494. she seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days	he spent at home talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments	of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things	in which he alone was interested.	7.53874194150532
18495. do you still have the	book of the dead?	11.92589899509228
18496.  she asked him and laughing she added i	was nervous about buying a book with a title like that but i knew	you'd like it.	7.576387114400823
18497. yes he lied to shorten the conversation	i still have it.	7.455191079527877
18498. he was no longer able to relax in the	presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation	with his mother or father no matter the subject.	9.137267508339761
18499. as for the	book of the dead it along with his other books on religion had been	incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which	he had lived in new york.	5.787208181602326
18500. he had dusted each of the books carefully	and carried them all to the basement and trembling at having to open	the big furnace given them up to the flames.	8.19797521024672
18501. then he sped from the	dark basement and returned to his room and cried.	7.843407926201672
18502. richard left	america with his clothes his biwa and his image of acala and on the	freighter which took him to japan he plucked at the biwa trying	to make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient japanese tune he had	once heard.	6.019726956946484
18503. during his second week at sea he brought the curious melody	out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain	at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure.	5.787905883621993
18504. he stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty	north pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water.	7.000426104312035
18505. it was so dark	that he didn't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean	kept him from hearing it.	7.649573033948713
18506. it was as though the biwa had been eaten	up	by the wind.	14.504640723493376
18507. in tokyo richard took up a life similar to	that which he had lived in new york except that he had replaced his	biwa with a friend.	7.5228521185048285
18508. an american student named charlotte adams had	refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at	last succeeded in getting him to talk to her.	6.673129828829881
18509. he had nothing much to	say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied	her on some of her unusually searching tours of tokyo.	6.582548448311685
18510. in charlotte	richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which	after a fashion he envied.	8.196536179722322
18511. in time he grew to depend upon her occasional	company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate	in more social activity.	6.645336283902528
18512. she convinced him that he ought to be a member	of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms	and in the end he complied with her wishes although it was only rarely	that he added anything to the random conversations.	8.675149498044787
18513. at one such	gathering charlotte announced i was at ryusenji today.	10.172548632890837
18514. have	you ever been to ryusenji?	10.472119682746735
18515.  no one had.	19.237092080109804
18516. well it's at fudomae	and there was a tan young man quite naked taking a shower in	the pool.	8.00493884178879
18517. richard thought it a	more promising remark than any made during the last conversation but	charlotte's manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial	than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would	lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded	it.	5.500273971112471
18518. three of the four persons present all foreign students in	tokyo had been playing a game of judging popular japanese foods by	the in and out system an equation in which zen philosophy was used	as the modifier.	7.756111229739222
18519. soba udon and tea were in because they could be	taken noisily.	6.002446559592496
18520. sushi was out because it was pretentious.	12.23008923895811
18521. sashimi was	in samuel burns had suggested because it was too far out to	stay	out even if it was a little pretentious.	7.714848877068914
18522. richard had kept his eyes	down throughout the game the very sound of the chatter nearly painful	to his ears.	7.21344205763055
18523. he wasn't the least bit disturbed by my	watching him said charlotte.	7.560809233574742
18524. did you watch him?	17.171912493159287
18525.  asked	a red-haired girl named ceecee witter.	7.622507342753323
18526. i shouldn't have been	able to do that.	13.269528653714232
18527. well i was able to do it charlotte	said with no sign of irritation.	0.0
18528. i'm	surprised no one has been there.	10.570015425988428
18529. i've been there a number of times.	5.042141567298523
18530. sam i thought you knew everything about tokyo.	9.933401610082138
18531. you've never	been to ryusenji?	5.539895886183769
18532.    i've heard about it samuel	burns said.	5.566796116027718
18533. there's a little place there called lovers mound	dedicated to gompachi and komurasaki.	3.708899010225001
18534. yes a little parkish	place charlotte said and concluded anyhow it's all	very nice.	8.386824198939589
18535. and the man who brought sweet potatoes into kanto is buried	there next to a beautiful seated statue of fudo.	6.863969561061585
18536. oh that's what	i meant to tell you.	10.398550832016166
18537. this is the interesting part richard	she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking.	8.841460129160703
18538. there	was that fellow out there in the bitter cold-   my	god it was cold today said samuel burns.	7.884581855449982
18539. and the water would be still colder	ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it.	8.287178381605464
18540. and your golden	god said samuel burns probably went right home and poured	himself into a boiling bath.	7.833338170698159
18541. it would kill one of us.	18.63105190399245
18542. but	the point is charlotte said there he was freezing naked	in a little stream of water at ryusenji all in worship of fudo	the god of fire.	6.228860520068616
18543. richard's dark eyes came up and seemed for	the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light.	5.542917982132687
18544. it was true; fudo	the	god of wisdom was also thought of as the japanese version of acala.	10.99618047383709
18545. the conversation went on but richard stopped listening.	9.338719997675419
18546. he found	himself trying to remember something but he couldn't decide even the	nature of what it was he worked to recall.	8.574866940035962
18547. he had almost given up	when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of	the black pacific was the memory for which he had been searching.	6.563847466428849
18548. perhaps	he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter	and the ascetic at ryusenji he was unable to put it together.	8.318774694875552
18549. that night after leaving charlotte's apartment richard walked	about for a time before returning to his room.	7.047637994573878
18550. when he at last did go	to his room he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before	his little image of acala thinking first of charlotte's tale of	the man at ryusenji then of his biwa and the invisible pacific waters.	6.762315483948501
18551. and the next morning not sure of why he went he took the train	to fudomae and walked to ryusenji.	6.7881245862708655
18552. he was surprised by the sharp	sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which charlotte	had mentioned.	9.52931477531394
18553. he went through a gate to stand at the edge of the	water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots	high at the back of the pool.	7.996992376907792
18554. on the hillside above was caged what might	have been an incarnation of fudo or perhaps a demon.	8.880135014497203
18555. the strange	creature housed in wire made him shudder.	8.341215694113531
18556. the sensation he so overwhelmingly	realized was one which told him he had been there before	but he knew he had not and could not recall any place he had visited	to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls	or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach.	6.828227599909937
18557. he left the pool	and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple and the sense of	familiarity with the place would not leave him.	6.278187761345974
18558. into a little well before	the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he had an urge	to sound the bell before the temple to take hold of the rope and crash	it against the circle of bronze; but the spirit he wished to call	out would not he knew come in the person of the temple priest.	6.69886557739583
18559. instead	he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of	stairs and stood before the seated fudo at their head.	5.206969395667132
18560. the black fudo	seemed to stare rigidly back at him and richard's eyes were caught	by the fudo's in fascination and then richard was shocked as	all at once flames shot out from the sharp features of fudo's face	and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound as if the large statue	were about to burst from some pressure within it.	6.060876804996218
18561. then the flames	were gone the stillness fell upon the severe black face and richard	began to tremble violently.	6.361462262301334
18562. suddenly he emptied his pockets of all his	coins and dropped them into the box before the seated fudo and hurried	back down both stairways and away from the temple never looking	back.	6.719380366577789
18563. he walked all the miles back to his room.	9.37476583863188
18564. he seemed to	have picked up a virus that day because the next morning he had a small	cough and felt a bit hot.	8.566411931777575
18565. he stayed home reading and refusing to	think about his frightening experience at ryusenji.	6.955990454870539
18566. but the process	of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he	couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day.	7.783722900487885
18567. the	cold lingered making sleep difficult that night and he remained	in bed still the next morning now unable to keep from thinking about	the inexplicable sight of burning metal the wretched sound the unbearable	feeling of having been to a remote tokyo temple at some earlier	time in his life.	4.39244491018772
18568. all of the elements of the experience were impossible	and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never	again to visit the temple at fudomae.	12.204586212750339
18569. i was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when i was plowing	the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings.	6.496989835935114
18570. it	had grown hot early that day and i hoped that the boy my brother's	son would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground	carrying the jar of cool water.	6.127821545355727
18571. the boy usually was sent out at about	that time with the water and he always dragged an old snow-fence lath	or a stick along to play with.	5.967931257283562
18572. he pretended that the lath was a tractor	and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing tractor	sounds with his lips.	7.56949139879573
18573. i almost ran over the snake before i could	stop the tractor in time.	7.033748404049442
18574. i had turned at the corner of the field	and i had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into	the earth and i was thinking of the boy and the water anyway and	when i looked again down the furrow the snake was there.	7.606086120642392
18575. it lay half	in the furrow and half out and the front wheels had rolled nearly	up to it when i put in the clutch.	6.957982912084095
18576. the tractor was heavily loaded with	the weight of the plow turning the earth and the tractor stopped	instantly.	8.65926883882496
18577. the snake slid slowly and with great care from the	new ridge the plow had made into the furrow and did not go any further.	5.587517462815743
18578. i had never liked snakes much i still had that kind of quick panic	that i'd had as a child whenever i saw one but this snake was	clean and bright and very beautiful.	7.521603781906447
18579. he was multi-colored and graceful	and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only	so slightly.	6.826121669474411
18580. go out of the furrow snake i said but it did not move	at all.	11.10887719028275
18581. i pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out hoping to	frighten him with the noise but the snake only flicked its black forked	tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel without fright or concern.	6.097509146821502
18582. i let the engine idle then and i got down and went around	the wheel and stood beside it.	7.721756160345477
18583. my movement did frighten the snake and	it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped	again and its tongue was working very rapidly.	5.436336172996785
18584. i followed it looking	at the brilliant colors on its tubular back the colors clear and	sharp and perfect in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of	a baby's fist down its back and the diamonds were set one within the	other and interlaced with glistening jet-black.	5.954337190664868
18585. the colors were astonishing	clear and bright and it was as if the body held a fire of	its own and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin	vivid and alive and warm.	5.442260693132294
18586. the eyes were clear and black and the slender	body was arched slightly.	9.247919163025907
18587. his flat and gracefully tapered head lifted	as i looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that	solemn mouth.	6.8606758646903225
18588. you beauty i said i couldn't kill you.	13.686088808773588
18589. you	are much too beautiful.	9.118533821976325
18590. i had killed snakes before when i was younger	but there had been no animal like this one and i knew it was	unthinkable that an animal such as that should die.	8.369000929561034
18591. i picked him up	and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a	little wildly and i could feel the coolness of that radiant fire-colored	body like splendid ice and i knew that he had eaten only recently	because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart	of him like fieldmice swallowed whole might make.	5.000535753132551
18592. the body	caressed through my hands like cool satin and my hands usually tanned	and dark were pale beside it and i asked it where the fire colors	could come from the coolness of that body.	6.599958184525616
18593. i lowered him so he would	not fall and his body slid out onto the cool newly-plowed earth from	between my pale hands.	5.737723150024694
18594. the snake worked away very slowly and delicately	and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty and he carried	his head a little above the rolled clods.	6.687431067188754
18595. the sharp burning colors of	his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil like a target.	5.902564164932943
18596. i felt good and satisfied looking at the snake.	11.707830514603762
18597. it shone	in its bright diamond color against the sun-burned stubble and the	crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself.	6.457976418109641
18598. the	color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien too	in that dry and dusty and uncolored field.	6.622895098640549
18599. i got on the tractor	again and i had to watch the plow closely because the field was	drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a	danger of rocks.	6.651328812237935
18600. i had my back to the corner of the triangular field	that pointed towards the house.	12.939789058690298
18601. the earth was a little heavy and i	had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring	properly and i did not look back towards the place until i had turned	the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field	a long way from where i had stopped because of the snake.	5.388800835993898
18602. i saw it all at a glance.	14.425967366896408
18603. the boy was there at the lower corner of	the field and he was in the plowed earth stamping with ferocity and	a kind of frenzied impatience.	6.975756388666339
18604. even at that distance with no sound but	the sound of the tractor i could tell the fierce mark of brutality	on the boy.	7.678933223624066
18605. i could see the hunched-up shoulders the savage determination	the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels	and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick.	5.880402142312107
18606. stop it i shouted but the lumbering and mighty tractor roared on	above anything i could say.	7.242582034068102
18607. i stopped the tractor and i shouted	down to the boy and i knew he could hear me for the morning was clear	and still but he did not even hesitate in that brutal murdering	dance.	5.948337474879814
18608. i felt myself tremble thinking of the diamond	light of that beauty i had held a few moments before and i wanted	to run down there and halt if i could that frenetic pirouette catch	the boy in the moment of his savagery and save a glimmer a remnant	of that which i remembered but i knew it was already too late.	6.9396696108445735
18609. i	drove the tractor on not looking down there; i was afraid to look	for fear the evil might still be going on.	5.11000427288293
18610. my head began to ache and	the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes and i hated the job	suddenly and i thought there are only moments when one sees beautiful	things and these are soon crushed or they vanish.	6.282058878585513
18611. i felt the	anger mount within me.	10.981588546931944
18612. the boy waited at the corner with the	jar of water held up to me in his hands and the water had grown bubbly	in the heat of the morning.	0.0
18613. i knew the boy well.	16.20325629893319
18614. he was eleven and	we had done many things together.	12.77403531117276
18615. he was a beautiful boy really with	finely-spun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face and	his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike and his eyes were blue.	6.227640272567339
18616. he waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up as he would	smile on any other day.	7.870327753598411
18617. he was my nephew my brother's son handsome	and warm and newly-scrubbed with happiness upon his face and his face	resembled my brother's and mine as well.	5.814742013112522
18618. i saw then too	the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil through something	there where i had been not long before.	8.060711021428666
18619. i stopped the tractor	and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me.	7.142160925683225
18620. can i	ride around with you?	13.608656069977235
18621.  he asked as he often did and i had as often	let him be on the tractor beside me.	7.172433933306394
18622. i looked closely at his eyes	and he was already innocent; the killing was already forgotten in	that clear mind of his.	7.630048847340438
18623. no you cannot i said pushing	aside the water jar he offered to me.	6.486932703071203
18624. i pointed to the splintered upright	stake.	15.293512825203821
18625. did you do that?	13.535421074458899
18626.  i asked.	28.659110453221246
18627. yes he	said eagerly beginning a kind of dance of excitement.	8.181772205841687
18628. i killed	a snake; it was a big one.	14.015985320651005
18629. he tried to take my hand to show	me.	11.637504177391046
18630. why did you kill it?	17.61159709651902
18631.    snakes are ugly and	bad.	9.118533821976325
18632. this snake was very beautiful.	14.348401121477856
18633. didn't you see	how beautiful it was?	7.622507342753323
18634.    snakes are ugly he said again.	9.670406878971576
18635. you saw the colors of it didn't you?	9.751843329843403
18636.  have you ever	seen anything like it around here?	14.851038384543116
18637.    snakes are ugly and	bad and it might have bitten somebody and they would have died.	7.166809956905349
18638. you know there are no poisonous snakes in this area.	13.64376351739659
18639. this	snake could not harm anything.	8.254441635698543
18640. they eat chickens sometimes	the boy said.	13.133843158043385
18641. they are ugly and they eat chickens and i	hate snakes.	8.768190208095389
18642. you are talking foolishly i said.	17.799652589239614
18643. you	killed it because you wanted to kill it for no other reason.	5.825820622377272
18644. they're ugly and i hate them the boy insisted.	5.254919823845219
18645. it was beautiful i said half to	myself.	14.641503533571957
18646. the boy skipped along beside me and he was contented	with what he had done.	9.465597166959574
18647. the fire of the colors was gone; there	was a contorted ugliness now; the colors of its back were dull and	gray-looking torn and smashed in and dirty from the boy's shoes.	5.489343218527561
18648. the beautifully-tapered head so delicate and so cool had been flattened	as if in a vise and the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted	torn mouth.	7.328031460226586
18649. the snake was hideous and i remembered even then the	cool bright fire of it only a little while before and i thought	perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that and had	not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life.	5.06773775356135
18650. i wrenched	the stake out that the boy had driven through it in the thickest	part of its body between the colored diamond crystals.	8.61357679925586
18651. i touched it	and the coolness the ice-feeling was gone and even then it moved a	little perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles and i hoped that it	was truly dead so that i would not have to kill it.	6.21470828635337
18652. and then it moved	a little more and i knew the snake was dying and i would have	to kill it there.	8.611517974349141
18653. the boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again	and he was racing innocently in circles making the buzzing tractor	sound with his lips.	6.096224199898925
18654. i'm sorry i thought to the snake	for you were beautiful.	5.344127361900167
18655. i took the broken length of it around the tractor	and i took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and i struck its	head not looking at it to kill it at last for it could never live.	5.138888064681943
18656. the boy came around behind me dragging the stake.	10.593949436390735
18657. it's	a big snake isn't it?	8.254441635698543
18658.  he said.	27.770505909397876
18659. i'm going to tell everybody	how big a snake i killed.	3.9409848884369008
18660. don't you see what you	have done?	4.2280053972043765
18661.  i said.	22.589978126100267
18662. don't you see the difference now?	4.608334340123241
18663. 	it's an ugly terrible snake he said.	7.14162538120728
18664. he came up and	was going to push at it with his heavy shoes.	10.097767844988342
18665. i could see the happiness	in the boy's eyes the gleeful brutality.	11.158679117392918
18666. i could have slapped the boy.	16.637395637547947
18667. he looked up at me puzzled	and he swayed his head from side to side.	6.718491433348979
18668. i thought you little brute	you nasty selfish little beast with brutality already developed	within that brain and in those eyes.	8.172476930621261
18669. i wanted to slap his face to	wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth and i decided	then very suddenly what i would do.	5.744033709630084
18670. cady didn't come unglued easily but this had not been a day	of glad tidings.	8.095329838603257
18671. tax worries production worries personnel worries	and the letter from hanford college his own alma mater a real snapper.	5.15576524365156
18672. hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago.	7.879513779734377
18673. yes the boy's credentials were in order- scholastic transcript	character references picture health record successful college boards.	6.425825565315495
18674. but due to the many applicants on file would he co-operate and write	a personal letter giving them his son's motivation interests and	his qualifications for leadership?	7.568986903451163
18675.    cady partlow lit his	pipe with no comfort.	7.14162538120728
18676. this was the letter which would	or would not enroll his son david in hanford.	10.382711787538664
18677. his son who had never	held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life.	6.345909249690577
18678. his son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor lawyer merchant	or chief.	11.154891164612224
18679. he wondered if he had played it wrong.	10.956138982259073
18680. maybe	he should have kept in touch.	9.670406878971576
18681. but he had been	busy building a business being a big man in his own town just as	he had been a big man at hanford class of 1935.	6.93847948602247
18682. besides cady partlow	knew he wasn't the old-grad-type.	10.284905525944948
18683. look at pete alcorn who hadn't missed a hanford ball game	in fifteen years.	8.830001386156479
18684. hanford college	little	ivy league had no room for football players with low grades.	7.816541020648697
18685. cady looked at his own son's scholastic record with pride.	6.210871206873012
18686. good	solid b average with a sprinkling of a's in math and science.	7.809995658144575
18687. imagine his son being that good in science! mr partlow could	still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered	what a near thing chemistry had been for him at hanford.	4.822285669775309
18688. but then	he hadn't studied very hard.	14.306364280244424
18689. getting elected president of the student	body took a lot of time and politicking.	9.213101248268575
18690. he put down his	pipe and started to type.	11.45143587764551
18691. in response to your letter i can in good	conscience recommend my son david in the field of leadership.	9.512277889407613
18692. he stopped and looked at the picture of his son the picture on	his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate	for hanford college.	6.907478354700837
18693. he didn't have to be told his son looked	like him.	6.655401930142109
18694. david had the same gray eyes high cheekbones dark hair	and a certain rugged ugliness.	7.032105024464237
18695. he turned back to the typewriter with a little more	confidence.	11.111158019383609
18696. his interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics	tennis and swimming.	8.351818438430747
18697. his chief motivation for enrolling at	hanford is the desire to-   mr partlow banged his fist	on the keyboard ruining the letter.	5.434268348490789
18698. he paced to the window and looked	at the city he had helped to build.	8.780253468194578
18699. how do you tell a college	president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do?	7.9676621329752
18700.  that	you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him	into a profession so you can say at the club of course david has	known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer- or a lawyer	or an editor?	7.6097270840619515
18701.    how do you tell a college like hanford that	your son has a vast potential that he will find himself?	7.388462602011699
18702.  just give	him time give him a chance.	11.495411112805801
18703. cady snapped the venetian blind	shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter rolled in a fresh	sheet and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed	on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head.	4.777896602575284
18704. what a production to make of a letter commending your own son!	his eyebrow went up in amusement at his soul-searching panic.	8.050177749469128
18705. he	told hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics.	7.492314771810789
18706. he	told hanford his son had participated in numerous high-school activities.	9.928116389115404
18707. he belonged to a social club a civic group little theater swimming	team and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer	of the science club.	6.40664079932965
18708. he finished with a flurry of good	wishes to hanford college and signed the letter.	9.326373578887134
18709. then he met the grave eyes of his wife anne from the photograph	next to david's.	7.825858022364431
18710. he shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket.	10.697093789223626
18711. better show it to anne and see if he had omitted anything.	7.294240329992203
18712. after all his wife had written most of his letters for him in those	first lean days of partlow products.	8.511179754676569
18713. anne had a way with words.	7.622507342753323
18714. half	of it was natural half was smith college.	8.774558972437266
18715. yet the whole	of anne was something she had never learned in any college.	7.125533558455503
18716. a woman	had it or she didn't.	11.87006678428286
18717. she said what she meant and let	it be.	10.161295031830592
18718. she never got on his back.	13.395846316838242
18719. he could take the advice or leave	it.	13.404632090050793
18720. he whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he	got on the elevator.	8.771944306967212
18721. you look like you just heard a real gasser	mr partlow.	8.498258318368384
18722. cady looked at tom who had taken	him	up and down for fifteen years.	7.391013650626644
18723. i was just thinking how things have	changed.	11.74036724649576
18724. when i went to college they begged you to come.	12.689211884923433
18725. be our	guest! it's our pleasure! now you have to be well rounded firm	in motivation and pre-packed with knowledge!   tom slid	open	the door to the lobby.	6.482872165102148
18726. that's a fact mr partlow.	4.764517592294243
18727. my john	applied to six colleges before he got in.	7.095994055561842
18728. he's president of the rocket club here	you know.	6.226827686383596
18729. always messing around with science stuff.	8.724060768995233
18730. real bright along	those lines you might say.	9.060328853487057
18731. he got a science scholarship to yale.	11.978715788829584
18732. oh	said mr partlow that's fine tom.	9.670406878971576
18733. as he drove home through the thinning traffic cady	felt the unease growing.	8.23315565584684
18734. he hadn't told anyone but he too had applied	to five colleges for david.	8.824820353737188
18735. they had all turned down his son.	12.30044024548134
18736. limited interests.	15.594944937291627
18737. he suddenly realized when he walked	into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the martini	anne had waiting for him.	5.891546773904067
18738. but tonight his drink tasted like branch	water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no	surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket.	6.81088806665634
18739. nor did looking at anne ease the tension as it usually did.	7.997453561679687
18740. he liked	looking at anne.	17.83289566254582
18741. he liked her blond hair and the	sprinkle of freckles across her nose.	9.035402972528193
18742. from those navy-blue eyes she	saw things as clearly and honestly as david did.	8.444448713982391
18743. she always could sense	the shag end of a woolly day.	8.509163976632314
18744. board meeting tonight cady?	12.391973375306865
18745. 	no i begged off.	9.118533821976325
18746. can	i have the car dad?	10.472119682746735
18747.    why not let him take it cady?	10.36236808368414
18748. 	i know it is midweek but it's only eight days before commencement.	7.937983718570805
18749. cady deep in thought neither	heard nor answered.	7.14162538120728
18750. carefully he put down his	steak knife and said loudly mr chairman!   cady	partlow's head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse.	7.404485708784127
18751. the car?	18.69259083039617
18752.  of course you can have it.	20.666599446493468
18753. dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else slowly methodically	and with interest.	6.027415029629315
18754. hear anything from hanford yet dad?	9.670406878971576
18755. 	cady begged the question.	9.118533821976325
18756. don't worry about it dave.	4.176400477476501
18757. your acceptance will come through.	9.347724754445679
18758. dave shrugged on his	sports coat and picked up the car keys.	8.58974999807994
18759. don't be too sure dad.	3.053035188604184
18760. charles burke got turned down by dartmouth and he is a straight-a	student.	10.360493699829528
18761. anne said it wasn't surprising because charles	was antisocial a lone wolf and completely one-sided.	5.542917982132687
18762. i can hardly	say the same about you dave!   dave kissed her lightly.	10.824506117511405
18763. girls my dear parent are here to stay! get my old man to	bed early.	5.542917982132687
18764. he looks a little bit frayed.	18.061324538843696
18765. anne waited until	the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot.	6.770700886966488
18766. let's go into	the library.	8.652758046626586
18767. you do seem somewhat tattered.	13.44371259307425
18768. cady trailed	her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable	book-lined room.	6.757567981697296
18769. i didn't know i looked so dilapidated!	wrong word darling.	6.320003807314731
18770. your fur has been rubbed the	wrong way and you show it.	8.205142482231215
18771. need any help?	13.33266277152813
18772.    in a way yes.	33.838274708982354
18773. hanford college hasn't decided on dave's application yet.	6.764147616291221
18774. they	want a letter from me on his motives interests and leadership.	8.497727219111919
18775. cady handed her the letter drank his	coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence.	5.60019589982758
18776. already he could feel anne's questioning eyes.	10.440318804367909
18777. i know you	wrote this in a hurry	but cady dave was only acting president	of the student forum for a few days.	7.261287234886356
18778. that was when half the school	was down with flu.	12.995112461539241
18779. and he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club.	9.667352269902846
18780. he just took over the week bill daley was in the state basketball play-off.	12.843759771688664
18781. cady stuck his jaw out.	8.254441635698543
18782. the fact remains he was	treasurer.	39.60790576527968
18783. no cady he	made second team.	10.628794361170721
18784. a team is a team insisted cady.	11.70189341780671
18785. anything	else?	15.610129252044759
18786.    yes she said quietly.	14.895633550238912
18787. i don't think	you've been quite honest cady.	5.321167624718023
18788. astronomy.	19.804021762487697
18789. he was mad about stars at the age of nine.	11.705417604447144
18790. geology	you and dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond	six years ago! those aren't his interests now.	7.75977692148908
18791. what	do you suggest?	10.363724110347151
18792.    just say he likes swimming tennis	chess and music.	10.673957607741787
18793. music! he hasn't been to a symphony	concert all season.	6.460370037324521
18794. but he plays bass	with chief crazy horse and his five colts!   you	mean that rock-and-roll combo?	9.757764267482612
18795.  even in that he never solos like jack	on guitar or rich on sax.	9.292516637237524
18796. he's- he's just there that's	all.	10.472119682746735
18797. he keeps the beat going.	13.328754055215526
18798. he	likes to play bass because he doesn't have to solo.	7.8248092711966075
18799. he doesn't	like to rise and shine.	10.776005861178222
18800. don't worry cady he'll be back in the	beethoven fold by next year.	4.693655786641076
18801. but i refuse to be brutally honest and mention	chief crazy horse and his five colts.	8.003471306077339
18802. anne laughed and	cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck.	9.329984262553964
18803. maybe	i am padding it a bit anne he said.	6.937054785357406
18804. but you know how hard	it is to get a boy into a good college.	13.263572776353175
18805. he has to have leadership	as well as grades.	15.212041085883303
18806. anne folded the worrisome document.	10.472119682746735
18807. did	you know he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale this	weekend?	7.599843929195408
18808.  he hasn't used it now for several years.	9.482216872931062
18809. can you really	say his motivation for college is electronics?	8.981649208345148
18810.    cady felt	the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel.	7.897235646792652
18811. and what	would you say he wants to do?	10.256582736926461
18812.  just what?	24.12764018878611
18813.    it's	dave who is applying to hanford college.	7.14162538120728
18814. why don't you ask him?	13.663388853342104
18815. 	for once cady partlow wished anne would yell at him so	he could yell back.	5.542917982132687
18816. i have talked to him but you know i've never	tried to push him into any profession.	9.722440102253898
18817. i won't be guilty of trying	to run his life.	7.011795747562975
18818. anne picked up the towel she was hemming	for the hospital guild.	8.58974999807994
18819. just because your father tried to make	a banker out of you you've leaned over backward to keep your hands	off.	6.18345631508541
18820. but subconsciously you've wanted him to conform to your mold.	11.144516821445718
18821. you want him to be a leader of men like you.	11.400287698266787
18822. cady put the	well-worn chip back on his shoulder.	9.068763847574985
18823. dave has qualities of leadership.	8.254441635698543
18824. he just hasn't developed them yet.	15.93329064165616
18825. he never will cady.	15.068059069186956
18826. not the kind of leadership you mean working	with lots of people.	10.358242199572793
18827. all your wishful thinking won't change	that.	9.785091048588368
18828. remember what you used to say in the army?	13.017283327234006
18829.  you can't run a war	with ninety-nine generals and one private!   cady walked	the block to the mailbox almost ashamed of himself for arguing with anne.	4.961624055085771
18830. martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist	at all.	8.571850877310746
18831. and once begun had grown to such monstrous proportions.	9.078296757283773
18832. the pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life.	10.153932004280875
18833. lying awake	at night he could see them laid out on the floor of his mind.	8.836201299035759
18834. when	he rose in the morning the image was still there.	9.248601565535601
18835. he had always	been a messy and negligent man.	10.918931351420587
18836. in his bachelor days his bedroom	had been strewn with clothes which his mother or later the hotel maid	generally saw fit to put in order.	8.164433496401529
18837. no doubt dolores resented following	in their footsteps.	10.724051427648279
18838. but it was fun those first days kidding	about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug.	10.470414911750577
18839. there	was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up.	6.573725984468509
18840. half	slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things.	8.372963641085187
18841. he	remembered the first time he saw her standing across the room at a party.	7.340211557527661
18842. the smooth curve of her neck very white against hair which curled	against it like petals.	7.860799503526907
18843. her hair was the color of those blooms which	in seed catalogues are referred to as black but since no flower	is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple	or blue- he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers	searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its	true shade beneath the darkness.	4.7900141444425755
18844. so he sought her out and spoke	to her and thought of his hand in her hair.	8.946285369641288
18845. or against her back	pressed on the column of vertebrae which held her so magnificently	straight and unyielding until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking	noises like the snapped stem of a tulip.	4.897569406520563
18846. but to put it	bluntly nothing snapped.	17.61249236409776
18847. yet that had not seriously troubled him	not then.	9.5605666824369
18848. more he could take at leisure.	12.89760508101065
18849. all martin	thought he needed was time: to what better use could time be put?	6.3679245317677085
18850. 	he saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly.	10.208466374747237
18851. there	was too little occasion beforehand for resistance the brave strong	delights of emotional clash and meeting.	5.8499816739908725
18852. they had left themselves	too much to discover.	14.46825350295397
18853. but at the start his new life felt invigorating.	16.724251554856554
18854. it was on the tenth day after the wedding	that he dropped the shorts on the floor.	13.250261829637637
18855. now i'm not going to pick up those shorts!	martin gave her a teasing pat.	8.721623440704747
18856. i think you'll get tired of	them there.	16.790687606295677
18857. in the morning the shorts were where he had left	them.	12.11272259625614
18858. he smiled to himself and decided not to mention them till	dolores did.	10.891839559707224
18859. it was almost too easy.	21.83093509210906
18860. for he had just remembered:	tonight they were having their first guests.	12.669651730336986
18861. the shorts would not be	on the floor when he came home that evening.	7.342113974448288
18862. the	rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness but in	the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts.	8.234992203261603
18863. they gave the room	a strange note of incongruity like a mole on a beautiful face.	6.376876511860498
18864. he saw that dolores intended to wait until the last minute thinking	he would get nervous.	12.613855219284895
18865. quietly he determined to foil her.	7.622507342753323
18866. i can	be as stubborn as she can he thought; my nerves are as strong.	8.613473101510026
18867. she'll	rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings.	7.399693948012309
18868. martin was standing a few feet from the front	door.	9.806455560957847
18869. he swung around eyes toward the bedroom some fifteen feet	away.	7.953394054598466
18870. dolores stood motionless in the doorway.	9.670406878971576
18871. he could not cross	the living room brush past her and bend down to retrieve the shorts.	7.605285587081398
18872. he strode to answer the bell.	16.253461520996265
18873. bill's hat was deposited in the hall closet.	8.108225911312923
18874. with the most casual	and relaxed manner in the world dolores led anthea to the bedroom.	11.760221489068845
18875. at first he could not be sure.	15.714104903279903
18876. then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there.	11.648855077952735
18877. a glissade of giggles slid over their voices.	8.023923068000494
18878. all evening anthea	favored him with odd coy looks.	10.566937912973131
18879. clearly she had been instructed	not to say a word.	8.270050172834136
18880. for some reason this ellipsis in the conversation	spread until it swallowed up every other topic.	8.845748025528591
18881. at last there	was a void no one could fill.	9.72700310275711
18882. the brainards went home early.	13.848082117783294
18883. martin realized later on that he should have had it out with	dolores that night.	6.157782125570901
18884. but he was so taken	aback he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in.	11.399306113189299
18885. on the contrary it would only weaken his position if he fumed while	she stayed calm and adamant.	7.824183542320377
18886. and if he surrendered after raving	at her.	16.937531543662352
18887. suppose he ran up the white flag altogether?	9.213166806925662
18888. 	at once.	15.594944937291627
18889. he considered the sober possibility.	12.127026643485452
18890. in	his head was the echo of those titters with anthea.	7.993963371949622
18891. there was	something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel	scabrous and unclean.	7.976318551181658
18892. he remembered his mother gossiping with her	neighborhood women friends	lowering her voice to a penetrating hoarseness	which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs where he	crouched listening.	7.663492800193362
18893. he could even recall the last time he sat there.	0.0
18894. she was talking about him that time because he had done some bad thing	something she disliked but afterwards martin said he was sorry.	9.052257956338808
18895. he apologized so sweetly i couldn't keep being annoyed with	him.	7.953394054598466
18896. it wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time;	he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened	which was as honest as he could put it.	7.24553549919109
18897. but his mother told the	story over and over till her martin said he was sorry was as	much a part of her as the shape of her thin pallid ears.	7.413482343312619
18898. the	battle had to be fought.	13.589290166239456
18899. let the best sex win.	16.938059354978364
18900. but his resolution	hardly seemed to help.	16.249673089949898
18901. if the situation had been bad it now got	worse.	10.994538306646076
18902. about this time people began dropping in considering	that the newly married had been left alone long enough.	8.017514092899379
18903. angrily martin	wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip- preferably	one that lasted months- instead of deciding not to postpone the date	until he could get away.	4.914571349332856
18904. here they were at the mercy of anyone who	chose to come by.	13.661930494423315
18905. these stray people nearly always insisted on dolores	showing them around the apartment.	6.487410277193333
18906. of course the tours of inspection	included the ever-present shorts.	14.646678723792014
18907. it was curious how the	different visitors took this.	13.062289472438172
18908. some tried to ignore the blot on the bedroom's	countenance.	9.584783452671674
18909. to them	all dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale.	7.945119355047572
18910. it's a little	contest martin and i have she would begin gaily carrying	the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course.	4.052613316838929
18911. while he waited	in the living room.	11.770135364812466
18912. they entered the	bedroom and dolores said nothing.	11.967541482367666
18913. then one of the guests showed his	merriment.	12.97449611012744
18914. you were in a hurry weren't you?	14.61704916710057
18915.  martin would	have liked to break the man's neck.	7.340243567790019
18916. dolores smiled; she let the	interpretation stand.	9.670406878971576
18917. now martin heard himself give a snort of mock	good nature.	7.304235152733095
18918. with her eyes dolores dared him for the truth ready to	begin: it's a little contest-   never again did he	enter into the ritual of showing the apartment.	6.75962265097091
18919. they kept up a	rigid pretense of speaking relations.	8.729760093721831
18920. but martin seldom felt the impulse	to talk about anything.	11.077418040299065
18921. what to talk about?	19.946752732958277
18922.    dolores kept	picking up any of his clothes which he left	about but he had been robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions.	7.649021478201203
18923. he fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets	so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers.	6.307865687113482
18924. in his moments of worst agony martin	imagined what his friends were saying.	10.301689440447241
18925. the sound of their amazement.	15.82973940139538
18926. bizarre: he could hear the word.	9.670406878971576
18927. we were up to visit them and h   he had thought her exactly	what he wanted.	6.939400130024042
18928. six weeks of marriage and i'm using the past tense	he told himself furiously.	8.352018501672953
18929. pursuing his idea he saw that it would	be impossible to leave her now.	5.725106139771221
18930. everyone would know why; he would	cut a supremely ridiculous figure.	8.588365263176025
18931. day	and night martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made	for himself.	5.427950274147271
18932. his mind scurried frantically seeking an exit.	10.276228481933904
18933. alternately	he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly	morosely to live out his life in this fashion.	5.869723508637666
18934. nothing would	change nothing would ever change.	11.20966096597004
18935. when the solution finally	came to him one night while he was in bed he was so shaken by its simplicity	that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before.	7.581357291985703
18936. in a frenzy of excitement he considered his plan.	12.822520260437535
18937. beside his shorts he would place something of hers.	6.460370037324521
18938. instantaneously	he would have won an immeasurable moral victory for if she picked	up say a pair of her panties she might just as well lift his	shorts lying alongside- the expenditure of energy was almost the same.	5.944299494118182
18939. he felt that it would be a particular humiliation to dolores to pick	up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor.	8.666035271806566
18940. furthermore	he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly: every time he went	in the bedroom he could drop a slip or a brassiere or maybe a girdle	next to his shorts.	5.867756097854561
18941. sooner or later dolores would crack.	8.842581037245965
18942. on the	other hand if she didn't remove her own things it would be difficult	to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the apartment.	8.422244438181218
18943. martin guessed that dolores would not be so eager to tell the	next installment of her story.	6.3591809137220165
18944. the tale he thought would become less	gay.	11.387658710676023
18945. she had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness	his lack of control his general male looseness while she	remained cool airy and untouched the charming teacher who disciplined	an unruly body.	5.1228410389078745
18946. to have her underclothes linked with his on the floor	would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd.	8.319279986639128
18947. something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence	of the plan lay in his faith that the idea would work because he believed	in it since his courage and virility were involved because it	was truly his.	5.83470013917517
18948. the knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death	and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted	fanaticism.	7.614116552419703
18949. the next morning while dolores was out of	the room he went to her bureau drawer took out a pair of nylon lace	pants and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts.	6.013299531219403
18950. he sat down on	the bed.	15.960151928300284
18951. in a surprisingly short time dolores appeared.	12.120094503603957
18952. to	his delight her eyes focused at once upon the two garments.	7.615092762846159
18953. slowly and	deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers	then hesitated for about a second.	5.4458023473964055
18954. ah he thought she's going through	the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well	pick up my shorts too.	6.290129093830134
18955. he saw that in a moment she had grasped all the	implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him.	7.084635849180763
18956. extending	her fingers another inch she caught up the shorts and swiftly	left the room.	7.198778874655976
18957. she did not look at him but he noticed that her face	was flushed and her eyes unsteady.	6.481903503096435
18958. they breakfasted together	but martin did not refer to his triumph and dolores found a great	deal to do in the kitchen bobbing up and down from the table so that	talk was impossible.	8.538074191159637
18959. well martin thought that'll save.	10.59633742259972
18960. he left	for work in high spirits.	13.671139498061125
18961. as he relaxed that day martin realized	how tense he had been these past weeks.	8.155228827261835
18962. he found that he no longer	hated dolores and he was	surprised at a resurgence of an affectionate feeling.	8.151949504457676
18963. good old a-z cap said.	10.410605689434599
18964. you know i've got	one of your cars at home.	13.233406668603052
18965. as a prominent industrialist you ought to	be interested in his nibs' support group.	7.989411253772792
18966. isn't his racket down	your alley?	6.367299372027611
18967.    once it was william thought.	11.2066383623343
18968. a rush of memory swept him back and he forgot cap.	9.351014077090149
18969. how did he start on such a ride to brief glory?	8.992337125359954
18970.  simply enough	through the inadvertent agency of his brother-in-law.	9.524905125277852
18971. general hershey's	draft and doc eddyman and cap were responsible for his first	eminence but fearless freddy bryan could take credit if he cared	to for the second time.	5.044674052201168
18972. freddy needed a job having been	detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper	financing by gerry and it was up to arthur willis to provide him	with one.	6.268961638044719
18973. mr willis bought zenith plastic products a	skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and	whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on long	island engaged in working out government contracts and installed freddy	in an executive position.	5.01661753105826
18974. shortly after freddy had his usual	proliferation of bold ideas.	9.931413763656616
18975. willis listened patiently and once in a	while william was exposed to them at a family gathering; he generally	heard freddy's suggestions without interest being absorbed by	his own prospering concerns.	4.8499587422515935
18976. probably mr willis was influenced	toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for	his grandchildren.	7.588035117915336
18977. gerry began to aid freddy with her father prodded	no doubt by joan's open contempt for freddy and william's irritating	competency.	5.79563815281975
18978. another factor must have been the eventual disposal	of willis' fortune; she unquestionably assumed that the more	he was entwined with freddy the more likely he was to reward freddy	richly upon his death.	7.104506158967768
18979. whatever the reasons willis and bryan	started expanding zenith.	9.456020473336114
18980. they acquired another electronics factory	a specialized ceramics company an organization that built- very	experimentally- high-speed research calculators.	8.242099297541822
18981. since they were	hunting for national defense contracts adam herberet a man of surprising	resources entered the combination as a silent partner because	of his political connections.	5.58182260464924
18982. feeling his power freddy looked	for additional worlds to conquer.	8.196044167676531
18983. heavy industry slanted toward inexhaustible	government coffers attracted him.	6.764147616291221
18984. the allstates auto	company a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles	and other off-road equipment had recently constructed an over-large	modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism.	6.710608697204349
18985. cursed with a shaky	management and dissatisfied stockholders it was ripe for amalgamation	and freddy's instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and	small expenditure of cash and never mind inevitable consequences.	4.595688357851942
18986. with	herberet's blessing he was convinced that allstates' wisconsin	folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly tanks	missiles or ordnance of some kind.	6.6833716765517766
18987. at that point william	came into the picture.	12.41857140882899
18988. although not much desiring the account he had	been appointed advertising head of zenith.	8.512698764929276
18989. freed of routine by having	his own firm and a complaisant partner his work in new york had	given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate	structure; and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he	did he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities.	5.118871052853363
18990. mr willis eager to have him allied with the family wanted advice	beyond the confines of his field and william set out on a serious	study of the situation including trips to wisconsin and washington.	7.222283144549935
18991. in the end he said: i'm not enchanted by the proposition	sir.	11.729421881250186
18992. i know a guy named jack hamrick a very bright young	engineer who was with chrysler and i took him with me to allstates.	8.70141518623646
18993. it's his expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what	you have in mind.	3.6174268740364495
18994. the conversion will cost a fortune.	12.853058711798363
18995. besides that	i'm acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through	my contacts in the air force.	6.55627160730604
18996. i think adam herberet is guilty	of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than	on the technical side.	8.6621460042716
18997. missiles have thrown everything up for grabs	and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here.	6.691766929908631
18998. the future of manned	aircraft is in doubt which affects government procurement and jet	transports have revolutionized the airline trade- one jet can take	the place of three compound-engine planes.	7.011454926424072
18999. this means the aircraft companies	are going to tear into the government market looking for anything	they can get and making the competition tough.	6.906005735235709
19000. here are a few facts	and figures i've assembled.	14.627003550324309
19001. can't you stay with what you have	and wait till the dust settles?	5.825820622377272
19002.    willis glanced at the bound	pages given him and shrugged.	8.196044167676531
19003. well he said there is freddy	you know h.	9.030945858913908
19004. freddy is deeply committed to our	plans already.	9.060328853487057
19005. he assures me he has people to handle the money raising	and ham richert my lawyer says the legal aspects of the wedding	of zenith and allstates are no problem.	5.651261382167409
19006. i don't like to exhibit	the deadly dampening effect of an elderly man's caution.	6.190293077133409
19007. i wish you wouldn't tell freddy i'm	lukewarm; i've caused him trouble before and he's beginning	to resent me.	6.68540679172395
19008. if we don't take care the sisters will be entering the	fray on opposite sides brandishing their cudgels.	9.063991747395741
19009. which	is a frightful prospect bill.	8.254441635698543
19010. one shouldn't	mix commercial affairs with patriarchy but in this case i have	no choice h.	9.931802535629378
19011. let me think about it.	13.43083019910872
19012. i'm most grateful to you so	grateful i wish you were my principal aide instead of freddy.	5.049083833360712
19013. not to william's surprise freddy adam and hamilton richert	prevailed; allied to them was gerry devoting much time to swaying	her father and joan dismissed all thought of the project and william	was unwilling to interfere further.	5.969445969665654
19014. zenith absorbed allstates	stock transfers were arranged and freddy became president of the hyphenated	combination.	8.241443683106137
19015. through jack hamrick william fell into the	world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for shoals and	clay.	5.77950822940946
19016. he forgot about a-z till unhappily he and hamrick	were proved correct.	9.592132658614503
19017. freddy's backing dropped away from him	and mr willis was forced to make up the deficit.	6.983555175307961
19018. adam beset by	changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the	new corporation couldn't deliver from his end.	7.78555604276668
19019. the wisconsin plant	turned out to be a white elephant.	10.644263175871144
19020. stock willis held in abundance	fell sharply in value.	9.552851042728184
19021. confronted by a grim future freddy lost his	nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation.	5.7628367322363525
19022. once more willis	summoned william.	20.674543996545005
19023. you were right he said- you and your	engineer- and i'm in something of a bind.	7.48083443662663
19024. freddy's solution	doesn't appeal to me.	10.472119682746735
19025. in addition to other defects i'm a stubborn	man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment.	7.842920182835696
19026. will you see if you can help me?	14.346547047925885
19027.    william spent a long	week end closeted with hamrick.	7.586591253013378
19028. his recent experience in motor car advertising	a love for cars of themselves the existence of a-z's	useless wisconsin set-up exposure to exciting conceptions of hamrick's	that nobody would buy and the coincidental recent failure	of a respected but out-dated small-car manufacturer called ticonderoga	motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid	to broach it.	5.818901899771677
19029. initially hamrick's reaction to a-z going	into the passenger car market was discouraging.	5.881264192582968
19030. he thought the financing	the advertising the production of new models the founding of	a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult.	9.119901852919131
19031. if a-z could buy ticonderoga cheaply and use their	presses and dies and other equipment if william could hit precisely	the right promotion note if the money hurdle was not insurmountable	h.	5.398203233704124
19032. they took nearly a month to investigate marshal statistics	and put their arguments down in black and white.	7.685753391288286
19033. taking hamrick	with him william went to mr willis.	7.723550340294943
19034. he was surprised and dubious	but impressed by the engineer and the report.	12.501891128360972
19035. your alternative	is breathtaking he said and i'm frank in saying	a bit mad.	6.869251746994195
19036. i wish i was younger and less timid h.	11.667618571823109
19037. well i can't	resolve this myself.	10.59633742259972
19038. i'll have to call in the brain trust.	5.82911624479367
19039. are you	willing to run the gantlet?	11.662254194960347
19040.  i can't guarantee you a sympathetic	audience.	8.559756559110644
19041. we'll be in there swinging william said	but in a way sir you've got to decide it yourself.	4.697889190468415
19042. you have	the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours-	and besides nobody else is going to have the courage.	10.580532446348412
19043. if they follow	anyone it'll have to be you.	14.054192067553574
19044. i should explain:	there's more here for me than advocating my little dream there's	you.	10.703160810518108
19045. you mustn't take a fall or publicly back away.	9.304545433833852
19046. you're- you're arthur willis h.	10.472119682746735
19047. forgive the hearts and	flowers theme.	8.254441635698543
19048. i rather like the music willis replied	quietly.	14.267372632515064
19049. at the meeting attended by freddy	richert herberet and the a-z executive staff with	mr willis presiding william and hamrick did indeed run the gantlet.	6.310261982910245
19050. from shock and incredulity most of the listeners went on to open	resistance and animosity.	10.383834517518485
19051. oh my god ham richert	said a little child shall lead them.	6.640530841321485
19052. it's absurd bill freddy said from a pale face.	3.923236818204181
19053. you're leading dad down the garden path.	5.955381787546666
19054. your	garden	god damn it! william said.	10.472119682746735
19055. i don't enjoy family	quarrels adam said.	5.514786625900389
19056. we're here to	transact business.	7.804108577112044
19057. can't we put an end to this arthur?	8.893914245665705
19058. 	hear me out please william begged.	9.670406878971576
19059. i'm an advertising	hustler i admit but i have to get hot once in a larger sphere.	5.735418466249376
19060. sure ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the big	three.	7.849096141726878
19061. their cars weren't small enough they didn't have the	power they were old-fashioned.	6.236389120184688
19062. they tried to sell 'em on economy and	simple merit.	10.372209341984666
19063. we've arrived at an age for romance and snobbery.	4.95948277650544
19064. we've all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age.	5.8810454180138585
19065. look what those little european jobs are doing.	9.23497008919382
19066. we'll woo the	consumer with a product not bludgeon him with chromed excess length	and weight.	5.379346023429161
19067. let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and	a seduction at reasonable rates.	4.973530798176596
19068. ticonderoga folded a few minutes too	soon before the tide changed still honest and stupid- and the network	of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again-	waiting for us ready-made.	6.159743744036464
19069. we've got rid of the steam yachts	and georgian houses and the bloated too-expensive automobile is	next.	4.529748795365511
19070. why not come down smartly in the world in a chic fashion with	an allstates-zenith?	12.299198455716985
19071.    he swayed them somewhat but the	debate raged on.	9.026368296067464
19072. financing emerged as the main obstacle.	10.57735792491237
19073. mr willis	made it evident that he had contributed his maximum.	8.454004814742731
19074. nobody	will underwrite it i'm telling you freddy said.	8.581436094141479
19075. i know	what i'm talking about in that department.	9.0543483926592
19076. there's	plenty of risk money ham richert added but not for anything	this risky.	7.816541020648697
19077. we'll	try to swing the deal on that basis.	6.764147616291221
19078. if we can't raise the capital	we're through.	16.39679464841186
19079. you're up against it anyhow.	6.61103868373433
19080. why won't you give me a chance?	12.081122396183716
19081.    a silence fell.	13.888991817500228
19082. heads instinctively turned in willis' direction.	9.670406878971576
19083. he smiled at william	and slowly rubbed his hands together.	9.380612900150881
19084. i feel i must	answer the question he said since the onus later if any should	fall on me- i don't relish recriminations spread broadcast outside	my family h.	7.071409461798829
19085. i'm not giving you a chance bill but availing	myself of your generous offer of assistance.	3.711250782459371
19086. all the in-laws have got to have their day adam said and	glared at william and freddy in turn.	7.98292226510367
19087. sweat started out on	william's forehead whether from relief or disquietude he could not	tell.	5.674295354649883
19088. across the table hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled	thumb and forefinger.	8.87740477033209
19089. spike-haired	burly red-faced decked with horn-rimmed glasses and an ivy	league suit jack hamrick awaited william at the officers' club.	5.15576524365156
19090. hello boss he said and grinned.	11.25413376443662
19091. i suppose i can never	expect to call you 'general' after that washington episode.	7.617562178438066
19092. it was among these that hinkle identified a photograph of barco!	for it seems that barco fancying himself a ladies' man	had listed himself for mormon beard roles	at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said: with	your beard dear you ought to be in movies!   mills	secured barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge rushed to	the hollywood police station to report the theft and less than five	minutes later detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail	of cal barco.	6.357408436512545
19093. on their way they stopped at every gas station	along the main boulevards to question the attendants.	6.7519459689976005
19094. finally at ye	olde gasse filling station on avocado avenue they learned that	their man having paused to get oil for his car had asked about the	route to san diego.	6.192745772008729
19095. they headed in that direction and at san juan	capistrano by-the-sea came upon barco sitting in the quaint old	spanish mission drive-in eating a hot tamale.	5.972574630824442
19096. at the moment barco's	back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in	on his convertible which in their quest for the stolen lap rug they	proceeded to search.	8.059556987183361
19097. the robe however was missing for by that time	barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in glendale.	6.198484428488199
19098. the detectives	placed barco under arrest and without informing him of the	nature of the charge took him back to hollywood for questioning.	7.57906676832516
19099. thus it was that barco apprehended for mere larceny now began	to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered.	7.2017810978408665
19100. during	the return trip barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless	phrases such as: they're under sand dunes h they're better	off i tell you h i saved their souls.	6.129850041966821
19101. the detective commenting	on barco's behavior felt that he merely belonged among the myriad	citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged- that he was	a more or less harmless nut!   however while in his cell	awaiting trial for theft barco in a fit of apprehension made an	attempt to take his own life.	4.646913247742603
19102. the attempt had failed because when	endeavoring to cut his wrists this murderer of seven women had fainted	at the sight of blood.	7.35610325670687
19103. the jail authorities- attaching no particular	significance to the episode- offered barco whisky to revive him;	but the old fellow a lifelong teetotaler refused it and no more	was thought of the matter.	5.3383919875479915
19104. then it was that district attorney	welch entered the case.	13.535245937983477
19105. a man of vaulting ambition with one eye	on the mayorship of los angeles nothing ever escaped him which might	possibly lead to personal publicity.	6.509731934611904
19106. it was reported to welch's	office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide.	12.63354522773439
19107. welch	wanted to know why.	9.118533821976325
19108. now welch had a pet theory that	everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at.	7.338381476180471
19109. the suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory	to the test.	6.886786246715407
19110. so he paid a call on barco in his cell and began their	chat by stating bluntly:   barco we've got the goods	on you! it'll be a lot better if you come clean.	6.584579106954087
19111. at	first barco was evasive and shifty.	7.738906147426005
19112. but with welch's relentless pursuit	of the subject barco finally broke and started confessing	to one murder after another.	9.07881169272347
19113. by the time barco reached the count	of three the situation seemed to welch almost too good to be true.	7.145038710947693
19114. but	if true it was the case of which he had dreamed the case which would	throw him into headlines all over america as the hero of a great	murder trial.	8.477921855387107
19115. welch summoned jail officials to barco's cell.	7.14162538120728
19116. but to welch's chagrin the police captain pooh-poohed welch's	credulity in barco's confession.	10.750757072027339
19117. barco was clearly a nut.	8.254441635698543
19118. it required strength bravado daring to commit murder.	13.776920365054371
19119. that worm	a murderer?	16.25399040225975
19120.  ridiculous! then for the first time since his	arrest a glint of spirit lit barco's eyes.	9.620837220405054
19121. his manhood had been attacked.	9.627882438407596
19122. he stiffened and rose to his feet.	12.411802052220429
19123. he'd show them!	is that so?	8.254441635698543
19124.  he queried.	27.770505909397876
19125. well for ten years i've been	murdering women.	10.636285865583428
19126. i can lead you to every one of the bodies and there	ain't four nor five nor six of 'em- there's	seven!	the next day the police captain in derision organized what	he termed welch's wild goose chase.	7.771669507703554
19127. for indeed it seemed	incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and	not get caught at it even in hollywood.	5.991876708489284
19128. the searching party consisted	of the police captain welch barco policemen with shovels newspaper	reporters and cameramen.	7.860799503526907
19129. barco his state of apprehension	gone never to return had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained	his principal attitude from that time on.	5.7013572093274805
19130. he directed the cortege	of autos to the sand dunes near santa monica.	9.45987255013178
19131. stopping the cars at	a fork in the road he got out paced off a certain distance to a spot	between two shrub-covered sand hills and indicated a location.	4.904928016788942
19132. orders were given to dig.	10.472119682746735
19133. welch was worried.	10.363724110347151
19134. the newspaper boys cracked jokes and again	barco's pride was aroused.	9.430036403335416
19135. with greater precision he again paced	off a location this time a little more to the left.	7.879105412398512
19136. with	quibs and gibes the policemen again started digging.	8.581436094141479
19137. the captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when	finally one of the shovels struck an object.	7.689504147778353
19138. there's something	here! said the digger.	5.932255538785735
19139. joking stopped and everyone gathered	around.	8.254441635698543
19140. the digger thrusting about with his shovel now raised into	view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderer's hollywood	sport shirts.	9.171300410896574
19141. although it was a mere fragment of the victim's remains	it was enough.	9.404941668776756
19142. welch was wild with delight.	10.472119682746735
19143. his elation grew	as barco's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another.	6.156011880307865
19144. now did welch truly become the man of the hour and everything	that followed in the procedure of justice was a new triumph	for	him.	7.737807183415026
19145. it went to his head and his ambition increased.	11.391185334346941
19146. it was	apparent that welch was in cahoots with marshall and would use his power	as da to drag every possible sensation into the case.	7.503895602558694
19147. every	new scandal which would provide more copy for marshall's	pen would thus mean more publicity for welch.	5.326519577128725
19148. i knew that both	these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when	viola was called to the stand.	9.184445763390762
19149. once there the da with devilish	cleverness would provide marshall with headlines: viola's	multiple romancesh viola lake an addicth downfall	of another film idol! it would be fine publicity for the	man who was willing to walk to the mayor's throne over the broken	reputation of a helpless girl!   i studied welch closely as	the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how	he might be thwarted.	4.513951416276222
19150. it wasn't long before i sensed that there was	something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for	viola's destruction.	8.336294464796037
19151. he was bitter and resentful toward her personally	resentful.	10.939493574783542
19152. a dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps	he had entertained aspirations toward viola's favors- or even	more serious perhaps that he had attained a share of them and had	then been superseded by some luckier chap.	6.937348072780394
19153. i did not rest until i had	tracked the mystery down.	9.149455423864344
19154. one day over a	year before there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown	hotel.	10.394595385489673
19155. viola had been urged to attend by telephone and not knowing	the host or the character of the party she had gone.	6.677667190983227
19156. she arrived	late and as she entered the party noted that gentlemen seemed to be	in the majority; the air was thick with smoke empty bottles were	in evidence and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor.	6.330220010639265
19157. naturally viola had no wish to remain but she felt she	couldn't leave so soon after her arrival in all politeness to her	host.	5.15494863161474
19158. and it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken	refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds;	while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which	as fate would have it belonged to district attorney welch.	6.82556138622693
19159. as viola sat there a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes	and socks from the unidentified feet and as a prank insert rosebuds	between the toes.	5.932499726422299
19160. a little later the district attorney woke	up emerged from under the couch looked at his watch and realized	he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the culture	forum on the civic spirit of the southland in the byzantine	room of the hotel where his wife as president of the forum was	to preside.	7.014351947877816
19161. he made his way to his host's bedroom where he carefully	brushed himself off neatly arranged his hair and painstakingly selected	his hat from the many on the bed.	6.9099918070031014
19162. then noting neither the absence	of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds he made his way	to the byzantine room and with his usual dignity mounted the rostrum.	7.246299233220413
19163. the effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined.	9.959665343819593
19164. the incident aside from reflecting on welch's political	career had all but wrecked his home life.	7.860799503526907
19165. he never rested until	he discovered who the culprit was and when he did he vowed vengeance	on viola lake if ever the chance came his way.	6.047824748185199
19166. and here it was!	by such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in	motion.	9.131336782114857
19167. during these first days of the trial i didn't have	as much time to commiserate with viola as i should have liked.	7.485144132812767
19168. in the	first place it was difficult for us to meet.	15.02337668085041
19169. we couldn't be seen	together for the tongue of scandal was ever ready to link our names	and the tongue of scandal finds but one thing to say of the association	of a man with a girl no matter how innocent.	5.70616157978054
19170. i couldn't invite	viola to our house for mother snobbishly refused to receive her.	8.923469128060672
19171. now the czarship had not affected my own sense of social values	but mother had attained a reflected glory through it which had	opened the doors of los angeles-pasadena society to her.	5.5118758856980765
19172. there mother	was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated	by the budweisers the chalmers	and the heinzes	.	9.270959371096739
19173. i hated being dragged into the salons of these	aristocrats.	8.555241096529764
19174. but mother insisted for it is seldom indeed that anyone	remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive	midsts.	8.756480883640897
19175. in fact it was not until the king of spain had visited	at pickfair that mary and doug were beckoned to cross the sacred	barriers which separate los angeles and pasadena from the hoi-polloi.	7.577680190247476
19176. mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial	opportunities with pasadena debs who had been educated abroad and	with those of the more lenient los angeles area where a debutante was	a girl who had been to high school.	7.113882933363209
19177. but at long last came a time when	i broke away from mother and her society chi-chi in order	to spend a cosy evening with viola and her chaperon at her home.	5.7617898534032195
19178. however such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial that	every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered	to the world society and even alas to my own mother.	7.331562261045572
19179. when i arrived at viola's	i was shown to my surprise into the kitchen.	8.761559929449987
19180. viola greeted me in checked apron ladle in hand and explained	it was the cook's night out and that she herself was preparing	dinner.	6.927694513405703
19181. i sat and watched proceedings.	12.384361145835424
19182. there was to be roast	chicken with dressing giblet gravy asparagus new peas with a sprig	of mint creamed onions and mashed potatoes- all chosen prepared	and cooked by viola herself.	8.591428711012098
19183. i realized that hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem	but his agony could have been no greater.	7.198614323420134
19184. the most that was accomplished	was adding mrs beige's tray to the dish pile and by means	of repeated threats on an ascending scale seeing that the girls dressed	themselves after a fashion.	6.750841111652553
19185. i was saved from making the	decision as the phone rang and the girls were upon me instantly.	7.184572428822624
19186. here's	a household hint: if you can't find your children and get tired	of calling them pick up the phone.	5.736365996880677
19187. no matter if your children are	at the movies in school visiting their grandmother or on a field	trip in some distant city they will be upon you magically within seconds	after you pick up the phone.	5.878666751875915
19188. jennie and miranda twined themselves	around me murmuring endearments.	8.581436094141479
19189. louise climbed onto a stool	and clutched the hand with which i was trying to hold the phone claiming	my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency.	5.058802861773554
19190. somehow	managing to get out a cool poised won't you hold on a second	please i covered up the mouthpiece and with more warmth and less	poise gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment mostly the latter	including devil's island and the remoter reaches of siberia.	6.027016555906735
19191. i promised to illustrate the lecture if they so much as breathed	till after the call was completed.	7.303254076591264
19192. speaking into the phone	again and recognizing the caller i resumed my everyday voice.	8.274297111385378
19193. soon	we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little	things like jennie's holding her breath and pretending to black	out miranda's dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table	and various screeches thuds and giggles.	4.562943298383371
19194. under the circumstances	i had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone but when	i hung up i was reasonably certain that francesca had wanted to	remind me of our town meeting the next evening and how important it	was that hank and i be there.	6.49007278552853
19195. i discovered that the girls had	shrewdly vacated the kitchen and were playing quietly in the living	room.	7.300989902590016
19196. it seemed that i would be the gainer if i accepted the peace	and quiet instead of carrying out my threats.	10.501707095441045
19197. resolving to get	something done i started in on the dishes.	7.198967928069535
19198. i'm not saying	it right.	4.689455924676617
19199. what i meant to say was that i started to start in on the	dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink.	6.493804664658852
19200. they looked	so formidable however so demanding that i found myself staring	at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again this time about	francesca and her husband.	7.445606743158808
19201. how about them i thought.	13.145373452967048
19202. francesca	and herbert were among the few people we knew in catatonia.	8.600090955103825
19203. we didn't even know them till about a month after we moved- at that	time they had called on us after i met fran at a pta meeting	and had taken us in hand socially.	5.015091576040739
19204. they had been kind to us and	we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners and for information	as to where to shop which dentist doctor plumber and sitter	to call	just a village; the yellow pages of the telephone book were amazingly	.	6.912401020701024
19205. herb an expert on narrow	ties thin lapels and swatches was men's fashion editor of parvenu	the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation.	5.070261131628255
19206. fran	and he had met about two years after she had arrived in manhattan from	nebraska or was it wyoming?	7.561977099974932
19207.  she was the daughter and sole heiress	of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and having arrived	in new york with a big bank roll became a dabbler in various fields.	5.614583269807762
19208. she patronized greenwich village artists for awhile then put some	money into a broadway show which was successful.	7.555676063005962
19209. it was during her writing period that she and herb	met and decided that they were in love.	9.534628668119897
19210. they were married at a lavish	ceremony which was duly recorded in parvenu and all other magazines	and newspapers and then they honeymooned in bermuda.	7.265577330708706
19211. bermuda was not in style that year.	9.108420581679205
19212. they had honeymooned in	rome; everyone was very high on rome that year.	10.196558294107424
19213. they had bought	their house in catatonia after investigating all the regions of	suburbia surrounding new york; they had chosen catatonia because	of its reputation for excellent schools beaches and abundance of names.	5.347060393047361
19214. you are bound to get involved with people when you have	children fran had told me at our first meeting so it is good	to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little	housewives and dull husbands but people who do things.	6.677977941395668
19215. i admired their easy way of doing things but i couldn't escape	an uneasiness at their way of always doing the right things.	5.866674405168432
19216. their house was a centuries-old colonial which they had had restored	and updated and added on to.	7.795831923523458
19217. it had	a gourmet's corner a breakfast room a luncheon	room a dining room a sitting room a room for standing up a	party room dressing rooms for everybody even a room for mud.	5.464101411471991
19218. it was	all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children	would color in the coloring room paint in the painting room play	with	blocks in the block house and do all the other things in the proper	rooms at exactly the right time.	7.158552090653024
19219. their two boys were well adjusted	and like their parents always did the right thing at the right	time and damn the consequences.	5.178945784868798
19220. francesca and herbert considered	themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were	by filling their colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings	and other art objects	.	6.09983039226678
19221. fran flaunted her independence by rebelling against	the catatonia uniform of bermuda shorts and knee-length socks by	wearing bermuda shorts and knee-length socks in color; bright	pinks and plaids and vivid stripes.	4.625142923266387
19222. sometimes she even wore the uniform	in solid unrelieved black and with her blonde hair cut so closely	wearing this uniform she strongly resembled a member of the	ss.	7.374371951336112
19223. no one could dislike them i thought.	10.586181696819105
19224. sometimes though they	did not seem quite human.	10.396046455432458
19225. it seemed indeed that their house was	not so much a home but rather a perfect stage set and that they were	actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play and had talent	enough to fill the roles competently with nice understatement.	5.861306454485636
19226. practically	the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing	names; even brand names.	7.492126167552013
19227. you should hear the reverence in	fran's voice when she said baccarat or steuben or madame	alexander.	7.96685073762709
19228. she always let it be known that there was wine	in the pot roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy and	that koussevitzky's second cousin was an intimate of theirs.	7.134006301335687
19229. i wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not	for my fear that all the other inhabitants of catatonia were equally	unreal.	6.445891576201018
19230. i couldn't feel at home among them.	13.996665110122732
19231. besides francesca	there was blanche.	10.854941532285832
19232. francesca was pleasant and charming but blanche	was sweet.	8.581436094141479
19233. yes blanche was very very sweet- being in her company	was like being drowned in warm melted marshmallows.	5.765740110986516
19234. i had once been	a witness when blanche had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness	oh my souffle has collapsed.	8.647441829108876
19235. anyone knows how a real	red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe! if blanche	had been honest she would have yelled slammed at least a couple of	doors and thrown a few little valueless things.	5.2477026646029135
19236. but dear me no;	not blanche.	16.181449055670814
19237. after five minutes with blanche one might welcome	the astringency	of grazie who was a sort of gwen cafritz to francesca's	perle mesta.	6.544569872857486
19238. francesca and grazie were habitual committee	chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen equal	bosses of whatever pta or civic project was being launched.	6.409437279332991
19239. they	were inseparable not because they were fond of each other but because	they wanted to keep an eye on each other as they were keen rivals	for social leadership.	5.900963707982449
19240. grazie was mean: quietly mean and bitterly	unfunnily sarcastic.	8.581436094141479
19241. she it was who had looked to see if i was	wearing shoes upon learning that i couldn't drive.	6.411363902680135
19242. grazie had a small	slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast.	7.48018841049393
19243. she lived in an ultra-modern house whose decoration appointments paint	and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring; the pets	were a couple of siamese cats.	5.647555393301805
19244. her uniform was of rich raw silk in	a shade which matched her hair skin housepaint and cats and since	she was so thin as to be almost shapeless she rather resembled a frozen	fish stick.	6.358078627346519
19245. the husbands of these women and others i had	met in catatonia were distinguished only in that they were to me at	least indistinguishable.	6.532458327243786
19246. i couldn't tell one from the other.	14.897427629737603
19247. like	herbert they were all in communications: radio television magazines	and advertising.	6.210871206873012
19248. one or two were writers of books; all were fellows	of finite charm.	10.840544169261781
19249. each had developed a hair-trigger chuckle and	the habit of saying zounds! in deference to country-squirehood.	6.201390403188048
19250. i never thought i'd live to hear people chuckle and say zounds!	in real life.	9.170789717176909
19251. i wouldn't have missed it for anything.	11.289686895026959
19252. they	were sincere- men of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent	smile.	9.835111170509752
19253. these boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently	pressing one of his hands in both of theirs while they gazed misty-eyed	with care into the eyes of the person they were meeting.	6.34352606743378
19254. could such	unadulterated love for a total stranger be credited?	9.271508088337736
19255.  they were	always leaping to light cigarettes open car doors fill plates or glasses	and i mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that	i mistrusted bake shops that called themselves sanitary bake shops.	5.627209349487366
19256. o pioneers! i thought and wondered what	kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban	frontier; pioneers who looked like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher	conferences and who never called the school principal mister.	6.578545097803348
19257. i sighed thinking that among other things people here seemed	to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $85000	yearly; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get	on person to person; people who thought it was nice to be important	but not important to be nice; who were more ingratiating than	gracious more personalities than persons.	6.10007739284887
19258. in my estimation they	were people who read daphne du maurier and discussed kafka; well	not discussed him exactly but said kafka! reverently	and raised their eyes as if they were at a loss to describe how they	felt about kafka which they were because they had no opinions about	kafka not having read kafka.	7.246484882316012
19259. they were i felt people invariably	trying to prove not who but what they were and trying to determine	what not who others were.	6.372452435424263
19260. becoming aware that it was nearly	lunchtime i brought myself back to the tasks at hand.	8.619920952623524
19261. i made plans	for the afternoon- doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at	once making the beds and then maybe painting the kitchen.	5.643008810714759
19262. then i	remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every day for the	last week.	8.503841853782715
19263. bananas! jennie had shouted each time.	7.622507342753323
19264. they're	not dessert! they're not even food.	9.670406878971576
19265. they're just something	you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast.	4.878916156371267
19266. i dug around	and found a mix and was able to surprise them with a devil's-food	cake with chocolate icing.	9.161946407698698
19267. rule for cooking: if you can't put garlic in it put chocolate in	the cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence	in itself of the dearth of taste thrills mama had been providing.	3.946695724018317
19268. then jennie closed her eyes stretched forth her arms and said:	take my hand louise; i'm a stranger in paradise.	7.132676557160586
19269. needless to say i was furious at this unparalleled intrusion	upon free enterprise.	6.927308332220706
19270. how dared they demand to snoop in private	financial records disbursements confidential contracts and agreements?	8.107808129179913
19271. 	it is as though i said on the historic three-hour coast-to-coast	radio broadcast which i bought	and pre-empting the eddie cantor manhattan merry-go-round and	that man in the white house like some despot	of yore insisted on reading my diary raiding my larder and ransacking	my lingerie! my impassioned plea for civil rights created	a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider	replacing the eddie cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis.	4.575667950467567
19272. but	what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator	who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great	nation?	6.625318139840396
19273.  the savage barbarian hordes of red russian communism descended	on the athens that was mighty metronome sacking and despoiling	with their bolshevistic battle cry of soak the rich'! after	an unspeakable siege lasting the better part of two months it was	announced that the studio owed the government a tax debt in excess	of eight million dollars while i who had always remained aloof from	such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary i had earned	and the little i legally inherited as morris' helpless relict	was stung with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions	as to wipe out all but a fraction of my poor hard-come-by savings.	4.346247886371244
19274. i was also publicly reprimanded dragged through the mud by the	radical press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications as	the new republic the new yorker time and the christian	science monitor.	7.576273511845733
19275. it was then that i availed myself of the	rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional.	7.607017170089634
19276. the	litigation was costly and seemingly endless.	9.670406878971576
19277. i fought like a tigress	but by the time i appealed my case to the supreme court	mr roosevelt and his henchmen had done their dirty work	all too well even going so far as to attempt to pack the highest	tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me.	5.787630689521417
19278. presidential	coercion had succeeded not only in poisoning the courtiers toadies	and sycophants of the bench against me but it had been so far-reaching	as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing	me! i was ready like portia to present my own brief.	7.062470119494177
19279. but the	supreme court wouldn't even hear my case! my plea was unanimously	voted down and thrown out.	6.478669021782826
19280. again my name was on all the	front pages.	10.119425810593382
19281. i was it seemed persona non grata in every quarter	but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers	and students of jurisprudence.	5.943492170619754
19282. as charles evans hughes said	miss poitrine's limitations as an actress are exceeded only by	her logic as a litigant.	7.684369881407816
19283. albert einstein was quoted as saying:	the workings of the woman's mind amaze me.	5.805211950485163
19284. henry ford spoke	of me as utterly astounding.	9.926316780164305
19285. heywood broun wrote: belle	poitrine is the most original thinker since caligula and even	fdr had to concede that if the rest of this nation showed	the foresight and patriotism of miss poitrine america would rapidly	resemble ancient babylon and nineveh.	5.5382848575785735
19286. not only were	the court costs prohibitive but i was subjected to crippling fines	in addition to usurious interest on the unpaid debts which the governmen	claimed that metronome and i owed- a severe financial blow.	7.478794353265256
19287. nor as manny said had the notoriety done my career any good.	6.564147755284795
19288. my enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges	as reactionary robber baroness and even traitor!	traitor indeed! i point now with pride to the fact that long ere	the committee on un-american activities the minute women the	economic council and other such notable watchdog organizations	were so much as heard of i was hollywood's leading bulwark against	communism fighting single-handedly creeping socialism against	such insuperable odds as the fascio-communist troops of the nra	pwa wpa ccc and an army of more than twenty-two	million mercenaries whom fdr employed secretly through	the transparent ruse of regular relief checks.	5.760998116633903
19289. needless	to say my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period.	6.210871206873012
19290. could	it do otherwise?	13.148092146312546
19291.  even though i have always had a genius for	throwing myself into every role and playing it for all it's	worth no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune	her reputation her livelihood her home and her nation itself are	all imperilled.	5.79362734241998
19292. such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to	oscar winning performances.	9.75273981960998
19293. i tried my hardest with little help	may i say from my husband and leading man but somehow the outside	pressures were too severe.	6.315021236581096
19294. having	achieved stardom a fortune and a world-renowned	wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote letch	proceeded to neglect them all.	6.09983039226678
19295. never a quick study he now	made no attempt to learn his lines and many a mile of film was	wasted many a scene- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow	thespians- was taken thirty forty fifty times because miss poitrine's	co-star and helpmate had never learned his part.	4.910910828382031
19296. each	time letch went up in his lines i was the one to	be patient helpful and apologetic while he indulged in outbursts	of temperament profanity and abuse blaming others going into sulks	and on more occasions than i care to count storming off the set	for the rest of the day.	6.097108192128355
19297. as for his finances i was never privileged	to know exactly how much money letch had salted away.	6.775927682418985
19298. it was i who paid for our little home the food the liquor the servants-	even letch's bills at his tailor and the los angeles athletic	club.	8.422430273156332
19299. never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third	anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw.	5.710770093248437
19300. as for his private monies they were rapidly dissipated in drinking	gaming and carousing.	9.897702087021852
19301. more than once i was confronted by professional	gamblers bookies loan sharks gangsters thugs	and finger men- people of a class i did not even know existed-	to repay my husband's staggering losses or else h i	shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with	such a sinister milieu.	5.550699504147348
19302. and at three different times during our	turbulent marriage strange girls with the commonest of accents telephoned	to announce to me that letch had sired their unborn children!	having the deepest of maternal instincts my heart fairly bled when	i thought of the darling pink and white bundles from heaven i	would have proudly given my husband.	6.270495493335138
19303. ah you're too old was	invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever i suggested starting	a family.	5.427950274147271
19304. letch had made it abundantly clear that he did	not care for the company of my own precious daughter.	9.470020287639278
19305. i now felt it wiser	to keep baby-dear in school and- during the summers- at a camp	run by the society of friends all year around.	5.998929200339038
19306. her presence only	made letch more distant and irritable and in the hurry of buying chateau	belletch i had neglected to consider a room for baby-dear	so there was no place to put her anyhow.	6.792440725941663
19307. in his infinite wisdom wants us to have these inexplicable little	yet i adored this man letch feeley why i cannot say.	6.418019658355245
19308. with	faint	heart and a brave smile i endured his long absences from chateau	belletch his coldness his indifference his slights and his abuse.	6.290129093830134
19309. the times i can recall when i was publicly humiliated by him- lovely	dinner parties in our trianon suite where the collation was postponed	and postponed and postponed only to be served dry and overcooked	at a table where the host's chair was vacant; a splash party	at the new pool which i had built in the hope of keeping letch	away from public beaches when letch and a certain aquacutie stayed	underwater together for the better part of an hour; a lovely epiphany	party at errol flynn's on which sacred occasion letch stole	away with an unknown starlet leaving me high and dry to	get home as best i could.	4.596882049309961
19310. these are but a sampling of the insults i	endured.	11.293767957711886
19311. as mrs letch feeley was it any wonder that i once	the social arbiter of filmdom was excluded from the smart entertainments	given by the astaires the coopers the gables the colmans	the rathbones the taylors the thalbergs and such devout closely	knit families as the barrymores and the crosbys?	4.7117022560359425
19312.  as letch's	antisocial conduct increased our invitations decreased and my heart	was in my mouth whenever i played hostess at a fashionable screenland	gathering.	7.248223922968896
19313. between 1935 and 1939 letch and i made ten	films together each less successful both artistically and commercially	than the one before it.	5.543369420547032
19314. our last joint venture sainted lady	a deeply religious film based on the life of mother cabrini and	timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification	of america's first saint in november 1938 was a fiasco from start	to finish.	6.506321863752341
19315. as i was playing mother cabrini the picture was actually	all mine with nearly every scene built around me.	7.009387500466057
19316. but in	order to keep letch in the public eye and out of trouble i wrote	in a part especially for him- that of a dashing ruffian who sees	the light and is saved by the inspiring example of mother cabrini.	7.311017997652885
19317. and did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf?	8.108856755126041
19318.  did he trouble to	memorize the very small part which i had tailor-made to his specifications	a role eventually cut down to three short speeches?	7.170842323406731
19319.  did	he show the rest of the cast- numbering four thousand- the consideration	of arriving at the studio punctually- or even at all?	6.285661113734411
19320.  he	did not! the shooting went on for eight months! most	of our working days were spent on the telephone calling bookies	illegal gambling dens a certain residential club for young actresses	more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the	athletic club.	5.678958771583765
19321. whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was hung	over uncooperative rude and insulting.	5.7087574544940205
19322. he made many tasteless	irreverent and unfunny remarks not only about me in the title	role but about religion in general.	8.285200098821907
19323. by the time the film was released	we were three million dollars over-spent war was imminent and the	public apparently had forgotten all about mother cabrini.	6.537242083966512
19324. thanks to	letch feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me the notices	were few and unfavorable.	7.665477250608259
19325. only george santayana seemed to understand	and appreciate the film when he wrote: miss poitrine has perpetrated	the most eloquent argument for the protestant faith yet unleashed	by hollywood.	5.127889590291103
19326. but it was small consolation.	31.23513031479454
19327. in a rare	fit of anger and spite i farmed out my own husband to a small	and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment.	6.622437485165248
19328. the film was called the	diet of worms which i felt was just what letch deserved.	8.939600961965482
19329. it	turned out to be a life of martin luther of all things! it was	a disaster! in clothes letch simply did not project.	5.852193125549647
19330. he was laughed	off the screen.	19.87986593677342
19331. at the same time however i availed myself of the	services of that great english actor and master of make-up sir gauntley	pratt to do a quickie called the mystery of the mad	marquess in which i played a young american girl who inherits	a haunted castle on the english moors which is filled with secret passages	and sliding panels and unbeknownst to anyone is still occupied	by an eccentric maniac.	5.208007479077455
19332. it was a potboiler made on a shoestring	and not the sort of film i like as all i had to do was look	blank and scream a great deal.	10.530658005117875
19333. my heart was not in it but oddly	enough it remains the most financially successful picture of my career.	6.154590206088857
19334. letch had	returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than	before.	7.615092762846159
19335. i really loved that boy and in a feverish attempt to preserve	our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful wonderful person	letch had once been i took my troubles to momma hoping that her earthy	advice would help me.	5.6143642671414735
19336. if i could only think of something	at the studio near me to absorb his boundless energy i said.	9.53935626867277
19337. what is letch interested in?	15.01533375785406
19338.    bookies booze and	babes momma said bluntly.	9.670406878971576
19339. her reply stung me but this	was too important to let my hurt make any difference.	5.861360135781466
19340. i can't turn	the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon i said.	6.700267883345693
19341. up to date however his garden was still more or less of a mess	he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond	in the neighborhood he hadn't found it.	6.530473262321718
19342. it wasn't his fault	that these things were so.	13.388290833654258
19343. the difficulty was that each day seemed	to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately.	6.007853018407575
19344. as a result life had become a kind of continuous make-ready.	16.871861477634866
19345. once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention	he could undertake the things which really counted.	5.977314293753545
19346. then at last	his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to	read or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon	accompanied by his dogs.	6.785146975700082
19347. his dogs?	15.48465615741959
19348.  he had almost forgotten	them although they had played such an important part in his early	dreams.	9.318164483676966
19349. then they had always been romping around him on these walks	yelping with delight dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting	expeditions returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws.	5.41755164487652
19350. dogs did something to one's ego.	9.670406878971576
19351. they were constantly assuring	you that you were one of the world's great guys.	5.948261103333084
19352. regardless of how	much of a slob you knew yourself to be you could be certain they would	never find out- and even if they did it would make no difference.	7.470328228853435
19353. now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs	in the picture.	9.075621273366302
19354. what in the world were you going to do with a lot	of dogs when you left for town on monday afternoons?	11.895357287498395
19355.  you certainly	couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm	them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused	that they would have nervous breakdowns.	6.706220142251961
19356. why in the world couldn't	he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to?	10.37038161583175
19357.    it	worried him this inability to get the simplest things done in the course	of a day.	6.698484500982414
19358. he would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about	it.	23.7628532865268
19359. how in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business	raise a family be on half a dozen boards work actively on committees	and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents	of a bulging brief case?	5.999096008872277
19360.    was it possible that as people grow	older the nature of time changed?	11.559347699463594
19361.  could it be that it speeded up for	the aged in some mysterious way as if a bored universe were skipping	through the end of the chapter just to get it over with?	6.7652584005644565
19362.  or was	the answer less metaphysical?	12.833041965406032
19363.  did older people work more slowly?	9.101841287559294
19364. 	did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter shave clean	out a barn read a newspaper than a man of thirty?	7.40886397660739
19365.  did men become	perfectionists as they grew older polishing polishing reluctant to	let go?	6.508812153274703
19366.    it might be that certain people were born with a compulsion	to complicate their lives while others could live blissfully	motionless almost indefinitely like lizards in the sun too indolent	to blink their eyes.	7.9995637501299255
19367. perhaps it was his misfortune or good fortune	whichever way one looked at it to belong to the former group and he	was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded	none which was positively antagonistic to it.	6.129233180793529
19368. and then	again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the	things he had planned to do after retirement: reading roaming gardening	lying on his back and watching the clouds go by was because	he didn't want to do them.	6.758268286859214
19369. there was no compulsion behind them.	21.162391408267943
19370. they	could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn.	7.391013650626644
19371. during	all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done.	6.573489619936492
19372. this	habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do	anything for which no one was waiting.	7.78636069741457
19373. he looked at the luminous	dial of his wrist watch.	9.09528235214471
19374. it was five minutes after four.	21.30159973117459
19375. on some	distant farm a rooster crowed and far down the valley an associate answered.	6.790110549430442
19376. he turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head	against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn.	8.398993914299554
19377. at least	he could buy the equipment for his workshop.	8.609744417540954
19378. thus committed action	might follow.	15.01162032058062
19379. he went down to mills and bradley's hardware store	and bought a full set of carpenter's tools including a rotary	power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that mr mills	said were essential for babbiting and doweling whatever they	were.	5.176673049248625
19380. he also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools	and lumber for his workbench sandpaper and glue and assorted nails	levels and t squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he	had	no idea how to use or what they were for.	6.676555483696293
19381. that'll get you started.	9.118533821976325
19382. best not to get everything	at once.	11.016779167296878
19383. add things as you find you need 'em.	7.545635307028388
19384. he didn't	even ask the cost of this collection.	13.381815731653955
19385. after all if you were going	to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that	was that.	7.539454942125973
19386. when he returned home the station wagon loaded with tools	jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village using	the recently purchased second car.	8.96766694295396
19387. it gave him a chance	to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage	of acid comments.	7.953372439549197
19388. he had made such a fuss about buying that second car	that he knew he was vulnerable.	12.956154070128362
19389. he piled everything neatly in	a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall.	6.652562848167078
19390. that was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand	tools.	9.316760146639162
19391. in front of it would be his workbench.	18.858265760206162
19392. the old nightmare	which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him	once more only this time he couldn't pacify it with a sleeping pill	and	send it away.	7.435895975189796
19393. how in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall?	8.565080225357299
19394. 	how did one attach anything to a stone wall for that matter?	7.391013650626644
19395. 	after the pegboard there would be the paneling.	9.569521122692661
19396. he sat down on an	old box and focused on the problem.	9.805655982032302
19397. perhaps one bored holes in the stone	with some kind of an electric gadget.	8.663307822393996
19398. but then when you stuck things	into the holes why didn't they come right out again?	9.13577248224943
19399.  it all	seemed rather hopeless.	17.769399900666357
19400. he turned his attention to the workbench.	16.912465877013535
19401. perhaps that was the first thing to do.	15.029471637605191
19402. a workbench had a heavy	top and sturdy legs but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top	so that the whole thing didn't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately	collapse when you leaned on it?	6.199889877490184
19403.    mr mills had done	some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of	boards and two-by-fours which properly handled would he had assured	him turn into a workbench.	4.888073467647503
19404. they lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly	pile.	12.109031473732562
19405. mr crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot.	7.591299128521778
19406. how could	anyone know what to do with an assortment like that?	12.372779165588877
19407.  perhaps he	had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench-	someone who knew what he was about.	5.794623648110094
19408. then at least he would	have a place to hang his tools and something to work on.	8.406544491019217
19409. after that	everything should be simpler.	11.41573523370109
19410. he went upstairs to phone crumb.	16.8624504155031
19411. to his amazement he reached him.	10.631988245435306
19412. mr crumb was laid up with a	bad cold.	10.220141507052027
19413. he didn't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone	wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable	equally lightly.	5.2386425386211135
19414. the only trouble was that he himself was tied	up on the school job.	13.508104919088563
19415. that was why he hadn't been able to finish	the porch.	10.361924875379506
19416. no he didn't know of any handyman-carpenter.	10.67656692536319
19417. there	wasn't any such thing any more.	8.498393850252723
19418. carpenters all wanted steady work and	at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could	hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school	job.	6.446934883945742
19419. there was a fellow named blatz over smithtown way.	14.374086352143031
19420. nobody	liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going	to be taken drunk.	7.561972602803971
19421. mr crumb would probably see him at lodge meeting	the next night.	6.903126807875096
19422. if he was sober which was doubtful he'd have	him get in touch with mr crombie.	13.037343159344667
19423. mr blatz had been	at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to	be the greatest boon that had come into mr crombie's life since	he moved to highfield in spite of the fact that he didn't work very	fast or very long at a time and he didn't like to work at all unless	mr crombie hung around and talked to him.	4.98185931425667
19424. he said he was the lonely	type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of	the cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you.	10.106997694571547
19425. so mr crombie	sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep mr blatz's	mind from funny things.	6.917344438555512
19426. at the same time he watched carefully to see	how one attached pegboards to stone walls but mr blatz was usually	standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he	didn't like to disclose his ignorance.	7.604836574238872
19427. while mr blatz	was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench mr crombie	told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar.	5.453027826386528
19428. mr blatz agreed that this would be pretty.	11.880864940205193
19429. without further discussion	he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over	the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling which he	then stained and waxed according to his taste.	5.0628557593094135
19430. now he said	we got to put in some outlets for them power tools; then a couple	of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an' i guess we're about	through down here.	7.15750276183135
19431. it all did look very efficient and	shipshape.	13.75025600984426
19432. there was no question of that.	28.86949411119246
19433. by the way said mr	blatz packing his tools into a battered carrier them power tools	needs extra voltage.	7.357291221124282
19434. i guess you know about that.	13.93195501835056
19435. before you use	'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need	a new fuse box for the extra circuits.	5.708419612584064
19436. that ain't too bad 'ceptin'	the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do	nothin'.	7.910353247503275
19437. instead of being depressed by this news mr	crombie was actually relieved.	9.044378543942939
19438. at least the moment was postponed when	he had to face the mystery of the power tools.	12.444221982408411
19439. he followed mr	blatz up the cellar stairs.	9.783357976961607
19440. as usual mrs crombie was standing	in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils.	10.454158909177716
19441. mr blatz sat down	in the only unoccupied kitchen chair.	7.591299128521778
19442. well he said got	your man fixed up nice down there.	9.25185671432612
19443. he oughta be able to build a	new house with all them contraptions.	8.266744210599004
19444. mr crombie watched his	wife with an anxious expression.	10.220141507052027
19445. i was just sayin' to him that i'm	all ready now for anything else you want done.	7.00132224148895
19446. mr crombie	couldn't remember his saying any such thing.	10.220141507052027
19447. oh that's	wonderful cried mrs crombie.	9.768139674856712
19448. i have a thousand things	for you to do.	16.783113355104557
19449. doors that won't open and doors that won't close	and shelves and broken h   but those are the things i built	the workshop for protested mr crombie.	5.096092997096229
19450. those are	the things i can do now that i'm set up.	10.243965423020933
19451. i've	been waiting to get these things done for months she said.	6.002446559592496
19452. we	won't live long enough if i wait for you besides which you don't	need to worry- there'll be plenty more.	6.44893033609597
19453. but the discussion was	academic.	18.619186817396866
19454. mr blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf	above the kitchen sink.	8.42610189558379
19455. nothing in english has been ridiculed as much as the	ambiguous use of words unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences.	5.915093060555031
19456. ben franklin said clearly spoken mr fogg.	9.060328853487057
19457. you explain english	by greek.	15.784668708114987
19458. richard brinsley sheridan said i think the	interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two.	7.157777113721879
19459. and a witty	american journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more	true today many a writer seems to think he is never profound except	when he can't understand his own meaning.	5.592369931353768
19460. there are many	types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians	under such names as amphibology parisology and other ologies.	11.68189260519661
19461. in common parlance they would be described as misses- misinterpreters	misunderstanders misdirectors and kindred misdeeds.	7.981328359550558
19462. one species	of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition.	10.57319808690024
19463. did	you or did you not say what i said you said because jane said you	never said what i said?	5.083242045036259
19464.    another woman addressing christmas	cards said to her husband: we sent them one last year but	they didn't send us one so they probably won't send us one this	year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't	last year don't you think or shall we?	5.590037233974633
19465.    such ambiguous	exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded and	they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours.	6.122832205973779
19466. ambiguity	of a non-repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself	in.	7.615092762846159
19467. i'm terribly upset she told a girl-friend.	4.0028807404405535
19468. i wrote	bill in my last letter to forget that i had told him that i didn't	mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind- and he	seems to have misunderstood me.	6.997880946806087
19469. evidently bill was another of those	men who simply don't understand women.	6.002446559592496
19470. another case involves	a newspaper reporter who tripped up a politician.	8.52336728372511
19471. mr jones	you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted	the contradiction of your original statement.	5.697828438619779
19472. now would you care	to have us say that you were misquoted in regard to it?	8.867210326094005
19473.    questions	like this framed in verbal fog are perhaps the only kind that	have ever stumped an experienced politician.	5.408478191406743
19474. they recall byron's	classic comment: i wish he would explain his explanation.	9.33913350279515
19475. similarly when a reporter once questioned lincoln in cryptic fashion	lincoln refused to make any further statement.	6.112992417817493
19476. i fear explanations	explanatory of things explained he said leaving the biter bit-	and bitter.	8.923469128060672
19477. the obscurity of politicians may not always be	as innocent as it looks.	7.037582431970946
19478. senator said an interviewer your	constituents can't understand from your speech last night just how	you stand on the question.	7.173450453721864
19479. it	took me five hours to write it that way.	6.460370037324521
19480. the misplaced	modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity	than in the breach.	7.860799503526907
19481. this creates an amusing effect because its	position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word.	6.673670248095648
19482. a verse	familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain: i saw a man once	beat	his wife when on a drunken spree.	7.547210006082454
19483. now can you tell me who was	drunk- the man his wife or me?	6.484951157836937
19484.    the wooden-leg	gag of vaudeville another standby of this sort had endless variations.	10.72194143441056
19485. there's a man outside with a wooden leg named smith.	3.707015557625905
19486. what's the name of his other leg?	8.864218641579154
19487.    another	stock vaudeville gag ran: mother is home sick in bed with the	doctor.	6.008107428980288
19488. when radio came in it continued the misplaced modifier	in its routines as a standard device.	8.519366032847305
19489. do you see that	pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on?	9.723374051932941
19490.  i see	the girl but i don't see the car with slacks on.	6.192131294145479
19491. in	recent years gagwriters have discovered this brand of blunder and thus	the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the gagline.	5.113378554988781
19492. in one cartoon a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the	family addressing the doorman: excuse me but when we came out	we found that we had left my daughter's handbag and my wife's behind.	7.313599061221745
19493. journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips.	6.210871206873012
19494. not long ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest	that snapshots must be of a person not larger than f inches.	8.109601258105691
19495. classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions.	6.764147616291221
19496. readers of the reader's digest are familiar with such	items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips like the ad in	a california paper that advertised house for rent.	5.867756097854561
19497. view takes in	five counties two bedrooms.	7.622507342753323
19498. since brevity is the soul of	ambiguity as well as wit newspaper headlines continually provide	us with amusing samples.	8.70726371189402
19499. many shapes	in bathtubs.	14.471323505260026
19500. son and daughter of local couple married.	9.060328853487057
19501. apart from misplaced modifiers and headlinese journalism contributes	a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising	matter.	7.034080569899596
19502. a weekly newspaper reported a local romance:	h and the couple were married last saturday thus ending a friendship	which began in their schooldays.	6.835132713310349
19503. an item in the letters	column of a newspaper renewed a subscription adding: i personally	enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband.	5.839733282449376
19504. then there	was the caterer's ad which read: are you getting married	or having an affair?	8.136017751844836
19505.  we have complete facilities to accommodate	200 people.	12.236278259376768
19506. the newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the	anatomical.	11.06449559232486
19507. this slip is so-called because its semi-ambiguous	english always seems to refer to a person's anatomy but never quite	means what it seems to say.	6.700971966426257
19508. samples: he walked in upon her invitation.	9.060328853487057
19509. she kissed him passionately upon his reappearance.	9.130734915764195
19510. not without good reason has the anatomical been called	jocular journalese.	9.57232209063082
19511. in news items a man is less often shot in the body	or head than in the suburbs.	8.678967784779616
19512. while henry morgan was escorting	miss vera green from the church social last saturday night a savage	dog attacked them and bit mr morgan on the public square.	6.703630124896692
19513. such items recall the california journalist who reported an	accident involving a movie star: the area in which miss n- was	injured is spectacularly scenic.	6.230041993708335
19514. the double meaning in the	anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device as in the gags of	weber and fields.	8.781506401474692
19515. when a witness at court was asked if he had been	kicked in the ensuing rumpus he replied no it was in the stomach.	8.14338446437555
19516. strangely enough this always brought the house down.	8.581436094141479
19517. apart	from journalese and vaudeville gags the anatomical is also found	in jocular literature.	5.825820622377272

19687.  forty years ago an english writer w l george	dealt with this subject in eddies of the day and said as an example	that 'saint george for merry england' would not start	a spirit half so quickly as 'strike frog-eating frenchmen dead'!	there was also gott strafe angleterre moreland	reminded me and carthago delenda est or if you will deus	strafe carthage.	5.109842999426771
19688. it isn't what the ideologist believes in	but what he hates that puts the world in jeopardy.	7.902315861080761
19689. this is the force	in our time and in every other time that urges the paranoiac and the	manic-depressive to become head of a state.	7.096456418224691
19690. complete power not only	corrupts but it also attracts the mad.	8.80582908212031
19691. there is a bitter satire for	a future writer in that.	14.310383236411669
19692. great satire has always been clearly	written and readily understandable i said.	8.532533381809712
19693. but we now	find writers obsessed by the nooks and crannies of their ivory towers	and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity and complexity of poetry	and non-poetry.	6.134114696307169
19694. i wrote a few years ago that one of the cardinal rules	of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of	what the story is about.	11.872238021504918
19695. one day the children had wanted to get up onto general burnside's	horse.	9.811489964017555
19696. they wanted to see what his back felt like- the general's.	12.19326748223089
19697. he looked so comfortable being straight.	10.776005861178222
19698. they wanted to touch	the mystery.	18.509937452849552
19699. arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came	by.	6.536123690965156
19700. arlene had a hard voice too this	time.	10.977489482667984
19701. the policeman's eyes rather popped for a second; but then	arlene got another tone in a hurry and she said if it wasn't	for these dear children-.	5.197552922963109
19702. the policeman got a confused	funny look on his face and he had answered kind of politely now	look here lady: i know you got to entertain these kids and all.	6.748856710691515
19703. but this is a public park and it's a city ordinance that the statues	cannot be crawled on.	8.964195017651134
19704. arlene was so ashamed that she hung	her head when she said yes sir.	7.709396596654081
19705. the policeman walked	on but he looked back once.	8.341215694113531
19706. that had happened on the day when	two	other unusual things had occurred.	11.82668431128898
19707. arlene had taught them a new way	to have fun in their little private area; and they had told their	mother about the tumbles.	4.932359612941692
19708. in matters of exact information that kept	her one step behind developments; and so they were consistently true	to their principles.	8.238031735739774
19709. never mind arlene had said after	the policeman had left having pursued the usual unco-operative course	of grownups.	5.635716234946817
19710. i know something that is much more fun	that we can do on our little lawn.	12.003249955777997
19711. what is it?	22.366870059233243
19712.  asked	the children whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably	normal and predictable.	7.391013650626644
19713. maybe that was why they were cordial and	loyal towards the unpredictability of arlene.	6.490027861639375
19714. just you wait	advised arlene echoing the dialogue in a recent british movie.	9.320195625771744
19715. and when they had got to their little lawn they had had a most	twirlingly magnificent time.	9.331445627217722
19716. first arlene had put them through	some rapid somersaults.	10.42897291276049
19717. they had protested that that wasn't any	surprise.	11.40431524167798
19718. just you wait said arlene again as though	she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy	little sturdy statement.	7.226542408095166
19719. is it	anything like cooked-over oatmeal?	11.757674309947575
19720.  asked one of the children.	16.175384724461775
19721. not the least bit arlene snapped.	10.009742122044596
19722. one of the many things	that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously	particularly your very very serious questions.	9.577967966312709
19723. those were	especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest.	7.303096616249475
19724. she would	sometimes even get a little hard on you she took you so seriously.	8.465871844437721
19725. but not hard for very long.	13.32087353114638
19726. just long enough to make you feel important.	11.715879534826335
19727. now said arlene eventually making them both	sit in formation on a big root of a live oak the sort of root that divided	itself and made their bottoms sag down and feel comfortable.	5.090976854877514
19728. now	we're going to be like what general burnside and his horse make	us think of.	8.224938264294419
19729. the children looked at each other and	sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever.	8.554703210972606
19730. their curiosity	went happily out of bounds.	10.783667833983843
19731. then arlene threw herself	backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful.	8.105399995998898
19732. she held herself	that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked.	8.347995902467632
19733. imagine being able to laugh and wink when you're like the top part	of that picture frame at home one of them said.	6.203069029352619
19734. they both laughed	and winked back.	15.756408865151302
19735. i'm general burnside's horse upside	down arlene said sort of gaspingly for her: even she had	to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position.	4.425653178766926
19736. she made general	burnside's horse's belly do so funny when it was upside down.	9.676512795569494
19737. then she was back on her feet winking and smiling that enormous	smile	.	7.635793100687079
19738. and she would wink and throw	kisses.	15.52982985573769
19739. they both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time	but it made their lips and eyelids tremble.	6.844846080714984
19740. but they kept on	clapping for a long long time.	15.960440318808727
19741. this time arlene said	and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking	you're going to tell me what i am and what i'm doing.	6.756255939431794
19742. it	all has something to do with general burnside and his horse.	9.391426916702418
19743. this time it was so grand; they could tell exactly what it was.	8.137615958976305
19744. it was general burnside's horse running in a circle.	15.046151236757142
19745. his legs	shook and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to	his shoulders.	5.871550390903752
19746. that's the general's horse one of them cried	out.	5.415354612692042
19747. the other remarked in a happy laughter that's	a funny old horse.	7.958893482137874
19748. the first one said he sure does shake.	13.09300332252329
19749. then there was the general kissing his	wife.	21.420107508643188
19750. they had to be told that one.	22.325776495404497
19751. but it was even funnier after	they had been told.	14.648717092110791
19752. their father when he came back from those many	business trips just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips	and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in	the electric icebox.	6.7018463053934445
19753. he was the funniest	man.	23.79268092013764
19754. he never could keep still even when he didn't move his feet.	10.162149928427366
19755. then they had to get up and be general burnside.	10.363349106105304
19756. all they could think of was to run around in circles kicking	their legs out.	8.078761807336596
19757. then they said general	burnside was going to jump over his horse's head; and they did some	somersaults.	7.411452263715024
19758. but that wasn't very funny either.	18.3893642127394
19759. you	ought to shake arlene advised them.	7.622507342753323
19760. and arlene showed them how	to begin.	12.994442504837197
19761. she also taught them to sing i wish i could shimmy like	my sister kate.	6.892894936471871
19762. they were clumsy but they	were beginning to catch on.	11.555775202424963
19763. they also caught on a little bit on how to	smile a lot without your lips trembling.	7.5839703308888335
19764. imagine you won't get	your allowance if you're caught not smiling- or smiling with your	lips trembling too much arlene suggested.	6.865122331529688
19765. that helped a	great deal.	13.51881576711259
19766. they were a little late in getting home.	14.103111039843219
19767. i'm	sorry mrs minks arlene said in a tone so low you could	hardly hear it.	6.119512922998314
19768. my mother constituted herself the voice	of all of us.	9.544951717477968
19769. it's perfectly understandable arlene my mother	said in a friendly way.	2.9647453471384653
19770. i suppose you all were playing and forgot?	13.024390396949448
19771. 	yes ma'am the children chorused heartily.	7.622507342753323
19772. the children rushed off to	get rid of their sweaters; and arlene began tapping the kitchen door	open.	8.605312244972199
19773. arlene's a good girl my uncle remarked to us; but	he said it too soon for it came out just before the tap to which the	door responded.	5.023258872600587
19774. that tap had a slight bangish quality.	12.064727433049098
19775. she	really is a dear little thing my mother agreed.	6.460370037324521
19776. her upper lip	lifted	slightly.	16.19638981266906
19777. she was biting into a small red radish; and that action	always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing.	6.031690067332049
19778. also	she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled up in	a neat mean little heap at the white center of the radish.	7.02958142141867
19779. she would	try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth	to the place where she was biting.	5.710096329777779
19780. it never worked naturally; but	it made her look unusual.	13.153065790889992
19781. also when she had bitten off half of the small	radish she found the suspense unbearable; and she would snatch	the finger-held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it.	5.365154197334842
19782. one could hear a very faint ladylike sigh of relief.	11.192387044095703
19783. actually it	was inaudible to anyone not expecting it.	7.832100794927304
19784. but the warm joy of her brown	eyes was open to the general public.	12.847023587006271
19785. later on the children	told her further about somersaulting.	9.72542028910215
19786. it must be awfully good	for them.	22.218495701750093
19787. and awfully kind of arlene she told us later.	8.108856755126041
19788. but	do you know something curious?	10.472119682746735
19789.  she added.	19.287214484918096
19790. i reached into	that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress.	9.485141232370898
19791. i have no notion	why i reached.	16.546284712656718
19792. and i found a radish.	20.850026924177687
19793. was it an omen?	15.900962242516597
19794.  i thought	for a second.	18.25917094604721
19795. but i would not pamper myself in that silly way.	12.175845375235337
19796. i opened the window and threw the radish out.	10.853733375513935
19797. then my mother	blushed at this small lie; for she knew and we knew that it was	cowardice that had made one more radish that night just too impossible	a strain.	5.169171608445684
19798. arlene became indispensable; nobody could have	told why.	9.186019237828585
19799. it was in the air.	35.47312089413783
19800. a friend of my father's	came to dinner.	10.915928998043894
19801. he was passing through town and phoned to say	hello.	10.068881193379493
19802. as a result he was persuaded out to dinner.	17.498002847068985
19803. as a matter of	fact this happened every four or five months.	13.44148944679596
19804. sometimes he coincided	with my father's being at home.	9.734355488595261
19805. sometimes as at this juncture he	did not.	8.52362262641104
19806. but he was always persuaded out.	23.176187158177306
19807. he liked children	in a loathsome kind of way; the two youngest in our family always had	to be	brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment.	5.8610968321433035
19808. when he	had left i could never remember whether he had poked them in their	middles laughingly with a thick index finger or whether he was merely	so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action	not bothering to look.	6.458464347883421
19809. the children loathed him too.	14.1243401423943
19810. this evening	they were pushed in from the breakfast room with odds and ends	of dessert distributed over them.	8.291079047435423
19811. there had been some coconut in it	for i remember my mother's taking a quick glance at a stringy bit	of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her radish	with a shiver.	6.828123948775004
19812. they were pushed gently into the room by arlene-	whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back	around to the kitchen side of the door.	7.848693608147326
19813. we had just sat down.	14.611296062683865
19814. tell mr gorboduc what you're doing these days my mother	advised the children ceremonially.	7.370948779068098
19815. there was an air of revolt	about the children- even irreverence for their own principles.	10.455809835701716
19816. this	could be told chiefly from a sort of head-tossing and prancing a	horselike balkiness of demeanor.	7.584951955491047
19817. possibly the coconut-containing dessert	had brought up bitter problems of administration.	6.329284551645883
19818. but at the beginning	this stayed just in the air.	17.340670499240527
19819. we go to the park with	this nice lady one of them said.	9.627662823289032
19820. this happy bulletin convulsed mr gorboduc.	12.83916464908928
19821. you do?	25.54960716631462
19822. 	he asked between wheezes of laughter.	9.670406878971576
19823. he was forced to wipe his eyes.	14.411301151917424
19824. you don't step on the flowers do you?	7.690791604663914
19825.  eh?	15.610129252044759
19826.    one	of the children maneuvered out of range of the poking index finger.	10.990674977067894
19827. mr gorboduc	took a swig of his sherry.	8.641591308291794
19828. he was so long thinking that my mother had	time to inspect her sherry for dregs.	10.180083352048605
19829. usually this was done when	attention was diverted by someone else's long boring story.	6.383417673952361
19830. but this	time she was nervous: she was open.	11.89315510008271
19831. mr gorboduc was finally	in command of his mind again.	7.591299128521778
19832. tell me- what do you do at	the park?	10.638610523687824
19833.  he asked.	21.889553134177078
19834. this was delivered in a forthright way without	coyness and over-pretended interest- an admirable way with children.	8.724819808902861
19835. only unfortunately he could not remove from his voice a nagging	insinuation of the direct command.	6.968559906297528
19836. this nettled the children into the	revelation of exact truth a sacrifice of their secret superiority	over grown people but a victory in the wide fields of perpetration and	illegitimate accomplishment.	6.908815499345665
19837. we bump one said; and	the other went on to development of the idea.	8.919610474770472
19838. we grind too he	said.	17.711814362317945
19839. my mother was beside herself with curiosity.	9.204237969321259
19840. say that	again she pleaded.	12.266717274634834
19841. she laughed a little and tossed the dregs rakishly	around in her glass.	7.110917169669036
19842. you what?	32.4138876863193
19843.  she could see that mr	gorboduc was intrigued; the hostess in her took over.	7.884276060952289
19844. you what?	32.4138876863193
19845.    my uncle looked at mr	gorboduc.	9.452730157081492
19846. he read henry james and used to pretend profundity	through eye-beamings at people.	9.176540466704445
19847. he	would not look up.	9.292919473889432
19848. he was very funny about the whole thing.	14.59535732443208
19849. a delightful	vignette set in the unforgettable epoch of pre-punic war rome.	6.881248562988826
19850. marcellus the hero is beset from all sides by the problems of	approaching manhood.	7.810415301301886
19851. the story opens on the eve of his fifty-third birthday	as he prepares for the two weeks of festivities that are to follow.	7.372471095370545
19852. suddenly a messenger arrives and just before collapsing dead	at his feet informs him that the saracens have invaded silesia the	home province of his affianced.	7.034197625353378
19853. he at once cancels the celebrations	and buckling on his scimitar stumbles blindly from the house where	he is hit and killed by a passing oxcart.	6.050226383077868
19854. the albany civic	opera's presentation of spumoni's immortal il sevigli	del spegititgninino with guest contralto hattie sforzt.	7.860799503526907
19855. an	unusual if not extraordinary rendering of the classic myth that involves	the rescue of prometheus from the rock by the us cavalry	was given last week in the warehouse of the albany leather conduit	company amid cheers of hubba hubba and yalagaloo pip pip!	after a busy overture the curtain rises on a farm	scene- the ranavan valley in northern maine.	4.609400431044257
19856. a dead armadillo	the sole occupant of the stage symbolizes the crisis and destruction	of the old order.	8.125655919453033
19857. old order acted and atonally sung by grunnfeu	arapacis the lovely serbantian import then entered and delivered	the well-known invocation to the god phineoppus whereupon the stage	is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of wandering gorshek priests	symbolizing love lust prudence and general motors respectively.	4.667189402902636
19858. according to the myth old order then vanishes at stage left	and reappears at extreme stage right but director shuz skillfully sidesteps	the rather gooshey problem of stage effects by simply having	miss arapacis walk across the stage.	6.700864110418332
19859. the night we saw it a rather	unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the	armadillo complaining- in ad-lib- that it smelled.	5.671945877490186
19860. we caught	the early train to new york.	12.350455461918722
19861. a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with eurasian	proto-senility cults.	8.578155220704803
19862. it's somewhat off the beaten track to	be sure but therein lies its variety and charm.	4.159708680282497
19863. for example probably	very few people know that the word visrhanik that is bantered	about so much today stems from the verb bouanahsha: to salivate.	6.708744471356933
19864. likewise and equally fascinating is the news that such unlikely	synonyms as pratakku sweathruna and the tongue-twister	nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen	all originated in the same	village in bathar-on-walli	province and are all used to express	sentiments concerning british imperialism.	6.2718676830329985
19865. the terms are fairly	safe to use on this side of the ocean but before you start spouting	them to your date it might be best to find out if he was a member of	major pockmanster's delhi regiment since resentment toward the	natives was reportedly very high in that outfit.	6.614097665330244
19866. the	breeze and chancellor neitzbohr a movie melodrama that concerns	the attempts of a west german politician to woo a plaster cast of	the apollo belvedere.	6.157942065974489
19867. as you have doubtless guessed already the plot	is plastered with freudian jungian and meinckian theory.	7.705889412506561
19868. for	example when the film is only four minutes old neitzbohr refers to	a small victorian piano stool as wilhelmina and we are thereupon	subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool	was once used by an epileptic governess whose name of course was	doris	.	5.690765201136438
19869. for the remainder of the movie chancellor	neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano stool with a slat from a venetian	blind that used to hang in the pre-war reichstag.	6.600259968973506
19870. in this manner	he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt pangs caused by his	personal assaults against the english at dunkirk.	0.0
19871. as we find out	at the end it is not the stool	that he is punishing but the piece of venetian blind.	7.984551293357725
19872. and when	the slat finally shatters we see him count the fragments all the	while muttering he loves me he loves me not.	7.079208776545382
19873. after a few tortuous	moments of wondering who he is the camera pans across the	room to the plaster statue and we realize that neitzbohr is trying	to redeem himself in the eyes of a mute piece of sculpture.	6.594715847316057
19874. the effect	needless to say is almost terrifying and though at times a bit obscure	the film is certainly a much-needed catharsis for the repressed	movie-goer.	7.087625451771935
19875. the music of bini salfininistas	capital lp 63711-r one of the rare recordings of this	titanic	yet unsung composer.	8.461209110020324
19876. those persons who were lucky enough to see	and hear the performance of his work at the brest-silevniov festival	in august 1916 will certainly welcome his return to public notice;	and it is not unlikely that even as the great bach lay dormant	for so many years so has the erudite ingenious salfininistas passed	through his purgatory of neglect.	6.459078440208764
19877. but now under the guidance	of the contemporary composer marc schlek jr a major revival	is under way.	6.974211613318556
19878. as he leads the neurenschatz skolkau orchestra schlek	gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the baslot and	rattzhenfuut concertos including the controversial tschilwyk cadenza	which was included at the conductor's insistence.	7.312583047612054
19879. a major portion	of the credit should also go to flautist haumd for his rendering of	the almost impossible indianapolis movement in the baslot.	5.648044585629945
19880. not	only was haumd's intonation and phrasing without flaw but he seemed	to take every tonal eccentricity in stride.	6.7185842840258125
19881. for example to move	from the lowest f-major register up to a	barely audible n minor in four seconds not skipping at the same	time even one of the 407 fingerings seems a feat too absurd to consider	and it is to the flautist's credit that he remained silent	throughout the passage.	5.835799140470485
19882. we would have preferred however to have had	the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing at this and other spots	on the recording since it mars an otherwise sober if not lofty	performance.	7.576536488020987
19883. as broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted down by trite heavy-handed	commercially successful musicals and inspirational problem dramas	the american theatre is going through an inexorable renaissance	in that nebulous area known as off-broadway.	5.100633650998861
19884. for the last two	years this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called	non-dramas which have left indelible bittersweet impressions on	the psyche of this veteran theatregoer.	8.448852433713155
19885. the latest and significantly	greatest fruit of this theatrical vine is the an adaptation of	basho's classic frog-haiku by roger entwhistle a former university	of maryland chemistry instructor.	5.354557875064527
19886. although the play does show	a certain structural amateurishness	the statement	it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound	and worthy of our attention.	7.048125221969726
19887. the action centers about a group	of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria	and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot	coffee.	5.665687090798018
19888. they are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress	the police and an intruding government tutor.	9.219845218069999
19889. the innocence that	they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when	one of them asking for a piece of lemon-meringue pie gets a plate	of english muffins instead.	6.403299494303125
19890. leaving the theatre after the performance	i had a flash of intuition that life after all	is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee and that this	unpretentious moving clever bitter slice of life was the greatest	thing to happen to the american theatre since brooks atkinson retired.	5.697100978349977
19891. aging but still precocious french feline enfant terrible	francoisette lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old paris	again this time with a sexy ballet scenario called the lascivious	interlude the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls	hopelessly in love with a middle-aged steam shovel.	5.067407129679881
19892. a biting pithy	parable of the all-pervading hollowness of modern life the piece	has been set by mlle	lagoon to a sumptuous score	by existentialist hot-shot	jean-paul sartre.	6.643572495279872
19893. petite lovely yvette chadroe plays the	nymphomaniac engagingly.	7.14162538120728
19894. ever since bambi and more recently	born free there have been a lot of books about animals	but few compare with max fink's wry understated charming and immensely	readable my friend the quizzical salamander.	7.224228946326666
19895. done in	the modern style of a confession fink tells in exquisite detail	how he came to know and more important love his mother's pet salamander	alicia.	4.996184316836729
19896. it is not an entirely happy book as mrs fink	soon becomes jealous of alicia and in retaliation refuses to continue	to scrape the algae off her glass.	9.113214506023073
19897. max in a fit of despair takes	alicia and runs off for two marvelous weeks in burbank		at the end of which alicia tragically contracts parkinson's disease	and dies.	5.32443735105651
19898. this brief resume hardly does the book justice but	i heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major	problems of our time.	7.381055969410577
19899. opera in the grand tradition along	with mah-jongg seems to be staging a well-deserved comeback.	6.64568956822026
19900. in this	country the two guiding lights are without doubt felix fing and	anna pulova.	9.296586472104092
19901. fing a lean chiseled impeccable gentleman of the old	school who was once mistaken on the street for sir cedric hardwicke	is responsible for the rediscovery of verdi's earliest most raucous	opera nabisco	a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting	leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent of the mudugno	version of volare.	4.848820558144295
19902. miss pulova has a voice that maria callas	once described as like chipping teeth with a screw driver	and her round opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective of the	emotions demanded by the role of rosalie.	6.649975885493599
19903. the champs elysees	is literally littered this summer with the prostrate bodies of france's	beat-up beatnik jeunes filles.	6.040227447879625
19904. cause of all this commotion:	squat pug-nosed balding hopelessly ugly jean-pierre bravado	a bogartian figure who plays a sadistic amoral philosophic tasti-freeze	salesman in old new-waver fredrico de mille rossilini's	endlessly provocative film a sour sponge.	5.900308518957012
19905. bravado has been	alternately described as a symbol of the new grandeur of france and	myself	and a decadent disgusting slob!	but no one can deny that the screen crackles with electricity	whenever he is on it.	5.7039244080694065
19906. soaring to stardom along with him margo	felicity brighetti a luscious and curvaceously beguiling italian	starlet turns in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic.	6.157942065974489
19907. the battle of the drib-drool continues but most of new york's	knowing sophisticates of abstract expressionism are stamping their	feet impatiently in expectation of v day	september first when augustus quasimodo's first one-man show opens	at the guggenheim.	6.002389433692205
19908. we have heard that after seeing mr quasimodo's	work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity	and importance of the whole abstract movement.	8.646094123254692
19909. and it is thought	by many who think about such things that quasimodo is the logical culmination	of a school that started with monet progressed through kandinsky	and the cubist picasso and blossomed just recently in pollock	and de kooning.	5.6113652685809825
19910. quasimodo defines his own art as the search	for what is not there.	7.391013650626644
19911. i paint the nothing he said	once to franz kline and myself the nothing that is behind the something	the inexpressible unpaintable 'tick' in the unconscious	the 'spirit' of the moment resting forever suspended like a huge	balloon in non-time.	5.146985026133122
19912. it is his relentlessness and unwaivering adherence	to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him	to paint such pictures as the invasion of cuba.	9.541435405589672
19913. in this work	his use of non-color is startling and skillful.	9.634377298640242
19914. the sweep of space	the delicate counterbalance of the white masses the over-all completeness	and unity the originality and imagination all entitle it to be	called an authentic masterpiece.	7.0829548937529525
19915. i asked quasimodo recently how he	accomplished this and he replied that he had painted his model a beautiful	shade of red and then had her breathe on the canvas which	was his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity.	5.465005769735735
19916. dear sirs: let me begin by clearing up any possible misconception	in your minds wherever you are.	6.828090284572241
19917. the collective by which i	address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but	an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves.	5.4534216585241655
19918. it is i	am reliably given to understand the technical argot for those who engage	in your particular branch of the boost; ie burglars who	rob while the tenants are absent in contrast to hot-slough prowlers	those who work while the occupants are home.	8.011378472378189
19919. since the latter obviously	require an audacity you do not possess you may perhaps suppose that	i am taunting you as socially inferior.	6.292327633087042
19920. far from it; i merely	draw an etymological distinction hoping that specialists and busy people	like you will welcome such precision in a layman.	7.337568080649797
19921. above all disabuse	yourselves of any thought that i propose to vent moral indignation	at your rifling my residence to whimper over the loss of a few objets	d'art or to shame you into rectitude.	5.685388502344685
19922. my object rather is to	alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest	implications for you far beyond the legal sanctions society might	inflict.	8.39788301907636
19923. you have unwittingly set in motion forces so malign so vindictive	that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about	them.	6.772735033805904
19924. quite candidly fellows i wouldn't be in your shoes for	all the rice in china.	7.471879158788382
19925. as you've doubtless forgotten the circumstances	in the press of more recent depredations permit me to recapitulate	them briefly.	6.892277511729595
19926. sometime on saturday evening august 22nd	while my family and i were dining at the hostaria dell' orso in	rome you jimmied a window of our home in bucks county pennsylvania	and let yourselves into the premises.	5.75167643898199
19927. hastening to the attic the	temperature of which was easily hotter than the gold coast you proceeded	to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet some khaki pants	and the like and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored	there.	4.65275567538021
19928. what you were looking for	eludes me but to judge from	phonograph records scattered about a fumed-oak victrola you danced	two tangos and a paso doble which must have been fairly enervating	in that milieu.	6.822732817585448
19929. you then descended one story glommed a television	set from the music room- the only constructive feature of your visit	by the way- and returning to the ground floor entered the master	bedroom.	6.017716069920732
19930. from the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus	beneath you abstracted seventeen ivory metal wood and stone sculptures	of oriental and african origin two snuffboxes and a jade-handled	magnifying glass.	6.842804864236177
19931. rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby you	unearthed an antique french chess set in ivory and sandalwood which	along with two box kodaks you added to your haul.	4.6904158433825796
19932. then having	wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on you lammed out	the front door considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover.	6.549286041222719
19933. so much for the tiresome facts as familiar to you i'm	sure as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake.	6.315204140983073
19934. the foregoing aided by several clues i'll withhold to keep you	on your toes will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of inspector	javert but before they close in gird yourselves i repeat for a vengeance	infinitely more pitiless.	6.015450314021184
19935. fourteen of the sculptures you took	posses properties of a most curious and terrifying nature as you will	observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in	patches.	4.7589021834239125
19936. in time these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce	riddling	you with frambesia the king's evil sheep rot and clonic	spasm until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for	release.	6.746225600374606
19937. all this though is simply a prelude a curtain-raiser	for what ensues and i doubt whether any occidental could accurately	forecast it.	6.2448847359387205
19938. if however it would help to intensify your anguish	i can delimit the powers of a few of the divinities you've affronted	and describe the punishment they meted out in one analogous instance.	8.082623557630361
19939. first of all the six figures of the buddha	you heisted- four siamese heads a black obsidian statuette in the	earth-touching position and a large brass figure of the dying buddha	on a teakwood base.	6.351435671199231
19940. now you probably share the widespread western	belief that the lord buddha is the most compassionate of the gods	much more so than jehovah and allah and the rest.	7.1545311282508
19941. 'fess up- don't	you?	10.363724110347151
19942.  well ordinarily he is except	toward impious folk who steal disturb or maltreat the	presence.	8.216429064128185
19943. very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such	jokers.	7.680236445935778
19944. eight or ten years ago a couple of french hoods stole a priceless	khmer head from the musee guimet in paris and a week later	crawled into the salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy.	0.0
19945. hell's own amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate	their	torment; they expired amid indescribable fantods imploring the blessed	one to forgive their desecration.	4.903693293796623
19946. any reputable french interne	can supply you with a dozen similar instances and i'll presently	recount a case out of my own personal experience but for the moment	let's resume our catalogue.	6.8758243609833585
19947. whether the pair of sudanese	ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers	to lead as a dealer in khartoum assured me i am not competent to	say.	5.4302073090680265
19948. likewise the ivory chinese female figure known as a doctor	lady; a friend of mine removing her from the	curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer but he had	previously drunk a quantity of applejack.	6.050574843883102
19949. the three indian brass deities	though- ganessa siva and krishna- are an altogether different	cup of tea.	6.8702649342863245
19950. they hail from travancore a state in the subcontinent	where kali the goddess of death is worshiped.	9.8052336950114
19951. have you ever	heard of thuggee?	17.15076508346365
19952.  nuf sed h.	13.148092146312546
19953. but it is the wooden sculpture from	bali the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and	their bodies interlaced by a fish that i particularly call to your	attention.	6.970753839931567
19954. oddly enough this is an amulet against housebreakers presented	to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949.	7.186048883154224
19955. inscribed around	its base is a charm in balinese a dialect i take it you don't	comprehend.	5.427950274147271
19956. neither do i but the tjokorda agoeng was good enough	to translate and i'll do as much for you.	7.803699773112825
19957. whosoever violates our	rooftree the legend states can expect maximal sorrow.	6.210871206873012
19958. the teeth	will rain from his mouth like pebbles his wife will make him cocu	with fishmongers and a trolley car will grow in his stomach.	6.673055462121845
19959. furthermore-	and this to me strikes an especially warming note- it shall	avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot.	4.903693293796623
19960. the	cycle of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours	and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation.	6.810441700982837
19961. sort of remorseless	isn't it?	9.118533821976325
19962.  still there it is.	17.106910684771456
19963. now you no doubt regard	the preceding as pap; you're tooling around full of gage in your hot	rods gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns	and generally behaving like u^bermenschen.	5.071134564377643
19964. in that case listen	to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled with our joss.	10.200760310863247
19965. a couple	of years back i occupied a village apartment whose outer staircase	contained the type of niche called a coffin turn.	6.038709991765743
19966. in it was	a stone tibetan buddha i had picked up in bombay and occasionally	to make merit my wife and i garlanded it with flowers or laid a	few pennies in its lap.	6.697471158637896
19967. after a while we became aware that the money	was disappearing as fast as we replenished it.	7.695224035186931
19968. our suspicions eventually	centered by the process of elimination on a grocer's boy a	thoroughly bad hat who delivered cartons to the people overhead.	7.662116210010093
19969. the	more i probed into this young man's activities and character the	less savory i found him.	5.427950274147271
19970. i learned for example that he made a practice	of yapping at dogs he encountered and in winter of sprinkling	salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet.	7.690570919080701
19971. his energy was prodigious;	sometimes he would be up before dawn clad as a garbage collector	and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us and thereafter would	hurry to the bronx zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar	butts against their paws.	4.710289137316026
19972. evenings he was frequently to be seen at restaurants	like enrico + paglieri's or peter's backyard drunkenly	donning ladies' hats and singing o sole mio.	6.825765186540753
19973. in short	and to borrow an arboreal phrase slash timber.	8.694445957554716
19974. well the odious little	toad went along chivying animals and humans who couldn't retaliate	and in due course as was inevitable overreached himself.	6.8818953907746065
19975. one morning	we discovered not only that the pennies were missing from the	idol but that a cigarette had been stubbed out in its lap.	5.6753006576139695
19976. now he's	bought it said my wife contentedly.	11.958593936993605
19977. no divinity will hold	still for that.	9.570057002710861
19978. he's really asking for it.	5.288696795849776
19979. and how right she was.	14.13662265827901
19980. the next time we saw him he was a changed person; he had aged	thirty years and his face the color of tallow was crisscrossed with	wrinkles	as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire.	7.509995305612635
19981. some sort of	nemesis was haunting his footsteps he told us in a quavering voice-	either an ape specter or abe spector a process-server we couldn't	determine which.	5.268146361684066
19982. his eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as dr	grimesby roylott's when he was found before his open safe wearing	the speckled band.	7.5851868240807905
19983. the grocery the youth worked for soon tired	of his depressing effect on customers most of whom were sufficiently	neurotic without the threat of incubi and let him go.	5.990117766331317
19984. the beautiful	the satisfying part of his disintegration however was the masterly	way the buddha polished him off.	8.59273213471369
19985. reduced to beggary he at last got	a job as office boy to a television producer.	5.85404990398964
19986. his hubris deficiency	of taste and sadism carried him straightaway to the top.	8.059409733643921
19987. he evolved	programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks	and quickly superseded his boss.	6.3332044950364645
19988. not long ago i rode down	with him in an elevator in radio city; he was talking to himself	thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at once clearly a man in	extremis.	7.256486815896725
19989. see that guy?	17.228524469834042
19990.  the operator asked pityingly.	15.841500723885778
19991. i	wouldn't be in his shoes for all the rice in china.	7.124787831243603
19992. there's	some kind of a nemesis haunting his footsteps.	9.203560720328083
