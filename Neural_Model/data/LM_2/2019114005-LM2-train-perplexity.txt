193. the last 10 cases in the investigation of the nov 8 election	were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m karns who	charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally	illegal means.	3.173754644103193

202. karns said it was a wrongful act	for wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand	jury room.	6.084327875247398
203. he said this constituted a very serious misuse	of the criminal court processes.	4.484415227483817
204. actually the abuse of the	process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook	county altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the	function of this court said karns who is a city judge in east	st louis sitting in cook county court.	4.926166260389623
205. karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35	persons.	4.233204957142977

210. after reading his statement discharging	the 23d ward case karns told wexler that if the seven cases	scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed he	would dismiss them.	5.19196736078904
211. president kennedy today proposed a mammoth	new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million	american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other	medical bills of 14.	3.3627088677444155
212. 2 million americans over 65 who are covered by	social security or railroad retirement programs.	5.723273667625607
213. the president	in a special message to congress tied in with his aged care plan	requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships	build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools and expand child	health care and general medical research.	2.998395621083665
214. the aged care plan	similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator a	fight on capitol hill.	5.1399427148873755
215. it was defeated in congress last year.	4.7617851212954
216. up to $37 a year	it would be financed by boosting the social security	payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now	paying such taxes.	5.561470101466323
217. the social security payroll tax is now 6	per cent- 3 per cent on each worker and employer- on the first $4800	of pay per year.	3.572447622506337
218. the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to	$5000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.	5.539500701422239
219. 25 per cent each.	6.45775869994751
220. similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad	retirement system.	5.526282753885905
221. the payroll tax would actually rise	to 7.	3.7577796654856237
222. 5 per cent starting jan 1 1963 if the plan is approved because	the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date	to pay for other social security costs.	5.466174533967569
223. officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would	amount to 1.	3.7617013015506195
224. 5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would	run 1 billion or more in the first year 1963.	6.790735962370344
225. both figures would go	higher in later years.	4.6489009192331325
226. other parts of the kennedy health plan	would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over	the next 10 years.	5.892079572014121
227. these would be paid for out of general not payroll	taxes.	4.573211965337369
228. the aged care plan carries these	benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad	retirement systems:  full payment of hospital bills for	stays up to 90 days for each illness except that the patient would	pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days.	4.948808599816368
229. full payment	of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from	a hospital.	3.529356823914186

231. hospital	outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess	of $20 a patient.	3.639493055583496
232. community visiting nurse services at home	for up to 240 days an illness.	5.543360129828824
233. the president noted that congress	last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical	bills of the needy aged.	3.6218704779452073
234. he said his	plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish	to receive care at the taxpayers' expense but who are nevertheless	staggered by the drain on their savings- or those of their children-	caused by an extended hospital stay.	5.18402049704567
235. this is a very	modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said	and with sufficient 'deductible' requirements to discourage any	malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.	3.2626531318127223
236. this	is not a program of socialized medicine.	9.053486462800551
237. it is a program of prepayment	of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed.	4.3026609365319635
238. every	person will choose his own doctor and hospital.	6.059904559192636
239. pay doctors	the plan does not cover doctor bills.	4.187958039283601
240. they would still	be paid by the patient.	8.014469845483857
241. apart from the aged care plan the president's	most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships	and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.	3.537249665380627
242. the president said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools	cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need	for health care.	5.1792067209755475
243. moreover he said many qualified young people are	not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the	schooling costs.	3.5198608850527564
244. the scholarship plan	would	provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal	to $1500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students.	5.443104870756416
245. the	schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships based on need	of up to $2000 a year per student.	3.6785037314050255
246. in addition the government	would pay a $1000 cost of education grant to the schools for	each $1500 in scholarship grants.	5.424792050070498
247. officials estimated the combined	programs would cost	5.	4.6683293822389
248. 1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21	millions by 1966.	7.2283967026523985
249. the president recommended federal matching	grants totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing	new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing	ones.	3.354801965787364
250. in the area of community health	services the president called for doubling the present 10 million	dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction.	5.453652805802516
251. he asked	for another 10 million dollar initial appropriation for stimulatory	grants to states to improve nursing homes.	3.52861401587786
252. he further	proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals.	5.811289196196424
253. in the child health field the president said he will recommend	later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau.	3.8549893436317926
254. he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national	child health institute.	6.511802815319711
255. the president said	he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation.	3.8183912290807305
256. he did not say by how much.	8.361702427007119

258. the president	said he will also propose increasing by an unspecified amount the 540	million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research	in medicine.	4.486208752874574
259. the president said his proposals combine the indispensable	elements in a sound health program- people knowledge	services facilities and the means to pay for them.	3.6928198429823547
260. as expected	congressional reaction to the message was along expected	lines.	6.813529628048521
261. legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under	the social security system criticized the president's plan.	3.455328106027178
262. those	who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message.	5.960558831277513
263. senate	republican leader dirksen ill and house republican leader	charles halleck ind said the message did not persuade them	to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance.	3.113251162533457
264. halleck	said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair	trial first.	5.766182245348244
265. house speaker sam rayburn d tex	called the kennedy program a mighty fine thing but made no prediction	on its fate in the house.	3.3379686061298552
266. acting hastily under white house pressure	the senate tonight confirmed robert c weaver as the nation's	federal housing chief.	4.9650705325721
267. only 11 senators were on the floor	and there was no record vote.	4.897148393577163
268. a number of scattered ayes and	noes was heard.	6.7524140519268725
269. customary senate rules were ignored in	order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing	and home finance agency.	3.49773583272938
270. in the last eight years all	presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been	denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least	a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor.	5.223389432846297
271. the rule was enforced by demand of sen wayne morse d	ore in connection with president eisenhower's cabinet	selections in 1953 and president kennedy's in 1961.	3.1627425659423887
272. the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting	of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been	the freer franker and wider discussions animated by much better mutual	understanding than in past meetings.	4.3515705678724075
273. this has been a working	session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed	along its route step by step and without dramatic changes.	3.673537974562581
274. in oslo	the ministers have met in a climate of candor and made a genuine	attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems.	5.274010318281069
275. this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable	where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers	and those who have never or not for a long time had such problems.	3.813822131092406
276. the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa exacerbated	by the difficulties changes and tragedies facing them and other	allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances	that have brought these troubles about has been conspicious by	its absence.	4.180495319916925
277. in the case of portugal which	a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council	should critics of its angola policy prove harsh there has been	a noticeable relaxation of tension.	3.5830670482827456
278. the general remarkably courteous	explanation has left basic positions unchanged but there has been	no explosion in the council.	5.248964928153788
279. there should even be no more bitter surprises	in the un general assembly as to nato members' votes	since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that	in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance.	3.4702453973092164
280. canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt	to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato	locomotive.	5.307016363987029
281. even norway despite daily but limited manifestations against	atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance	is today closer to the nato line.	3.8945569932820088
282. on the negative	side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the	united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for.	5.508815633184606
283. one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusk's	speeches as inconclusive.	4.339450285613401
284. but he hastened to add that	if united states policies were not always clear despite mr rusk's	analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the	west this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly	fixed its policy.	4.834521472256278
285. a certain vagueness may also	be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council	meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six soviet correspondents	accredited.	3.5727743426406624
286. the impression has nevertheless been	given during these three days despite mr rusk's personal popularity	that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat	tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn	than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application	to individual danger spots.	4.394161303867922
287. the secretary of state	himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of	events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the	new administration in the past four months.	3.931581873472763
288. but where the core	of nato is concerned the secretary of state has not only	reiterated the united states' profound attachment to the alliance	cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five	nuclear submarines will eventually be at nato's disposal in	european waters.	5.018147350660922
289. the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated	a warning to the soviet union that the united states will	not stand for another setback in berlin an affirmation once again taken	up by the council as a whole.	3.71141648286241
290. the secretary's	greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization	that east-west friction wherever it take place around the	globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different	societies and must be treated as such without regard to geographical	distance or lack of apparent connection.	4.481255332768301
291. the annual spring	meeting has given an impetus in three main directions: more deeper	and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use	of the organization for economic cooperation and development	as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries	and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the	maintenance of the nuclear deterrent.	3.076636869339166
292. this increase in the	threshold as the conventional forces strengthening is called will	prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months	to come.	5.411120153102568
293. each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid	down but never completely fulfilled.	4.372201768370114
294. the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a	geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy	erupts for the first time.	5.311213423427053
295. there is little optimism here	that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table	than they were in military actions on the ground in laos.	3.994204808485898
296. the	united states state department officials explain now is mainly	interested in setting up an international inspection system which will	prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring	thailand and south viet nam.	5.1203887859463455
297. they count on the aid	of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve	this.	3.8285774043598866
298. the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet	would not become communist dominated.	5.64047999232851
299. but it is apparent that no acceptable	formula has been found to prevent such a possibility.	4.461599465710138
300. the inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire	in laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the	cease-fire by the international control commission before participating	in the geneva conference.	4.771413143118361
301. this is another of the modifications	of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled	to make.	4.42289504185881
302. it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to	basic errors made in the previous administration.	6.151614161606269
303. its spokesmen	insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in	military and economic aid policies in the critical areas.	3.874529403612444
304. but	with the months moving on- and the immediate confrontations with the	communists showing no gain for the free world- the question arises:	how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy	decisions been in dealing with communist aggression?	4.454033325101789
305.    former	vice-president richard m nixon in detroit called for a	firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union.	3.5265759286706757

307. it does not take a gallup poll to	find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the	situation as republicans see it.	3.7246574782689503
308. they can hardly restrain themselves	from raising the question of whether republicans if they had been	in power would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in	cuba.	5.794565522973065
309. one republican senator told this correspondent that he	was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the kennedy administration	on this score.	3.4427036861183327
310. his reply he said was that he agreed to the	need for unity in the country now.	6.8729546786216655

316. mr nixon for his part would oppose	intervention in cuba without specific provocation.	6.421436449687027
317. but he did recommend	that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries	shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated.	4.065995605117743
318. until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories	in laos	almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended	a program that respected generally the opinions voiced both by	mr nixon and the professors.	4.876454237196909
319. very early	in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels	a high official source disclosed that the new administration	would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during	the formative period of the administration.	3.4052131716900456

326. but the communists	aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate.	6.469562729482567
327. and after several	correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the	huge build-up	administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a	great service and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty	organization.	3.264621716349367
328. seato was steamed up and prepared	contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos.	5.269953573499706
329. but	the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for	the united states to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over laos.	3.5161535504684465
330. there	was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded	that laos was ill suited to be an ally unlike its more determined	neighbors thailand and south viet nam.	5.123854902058445

620. pennsylvania avenue named for one of the original	13 states perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district	of columbia from a commercial standpoint.	6.101467091786297
621. but from a historic viewpoint	none can approach it.	4.7288404253411676

632. many spectators	will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering lafayette square	opposite the white house.	5.446957330588649
633. in this historic square are several	statutes but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen	andrew jackson hero of the battle of new orleans.	4.01731647306091

641. what does 1961 offer in political and governmental	developments in mississippi?	4.435239354722345
642.    even for those who have	been observing the political scene a long time no script from the past	is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political	future.	5.620729933050609
643. this is largely because of the unpredictability of the	man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected	leader of its two million inhabitants- gov ross barnett.	3.957600626086936
644. barnett who came into office with no previous experience in public	administration has surrounded himself with confusion which not only	keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well.	4.747412352933363
645. consequently	it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction	the barnett administration will take in the coming year.	3.5798570613686342
646. be scramble	some predict the administration will settle down during	1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far.	5.772975454322921
647. the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady	stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments	by barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's	office.	3.193471934857779
648. there are many who predict that should barnett decide	to call the legislature back into special session it will really	throw his administration into a scramble.	5.264394574932428
649. certainly nobody	will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett	will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful	honeymoon he had in the 1960 legislative session.	3.923366697076523
650. if barnett	doesn't call a special session in 1961 it will be the first	year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or	special session.	6.479099693950427
651. the odds favor a special session more than	likely early in the year.	3.8704689778888626
652. legislators always get	restless for a special session	and if they start agitating.	5.902611910960924
653. barnett	is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure.	5.049209815254073
654. the issue	which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive	problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six	to five to eliminate one congressional seat.	4.9626072479108485
655. with eyes focused	on the third congressional district the historic delta district and	congressman frank e smith as the one most likely to go the redistricting	battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers	from the delta have held in the legislature.	3.2556160047488256
656. mississippi's	relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads	during 1961 with the first democratic president in eight years	in the white house.	5.787712585013831
657. split badly during the recent presidential	election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and	independents the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck.	3.249072109015912
658. and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together.	7.171498853269466
659. barnett as the titular head of the democratic	party apparently must make the move to reestablish relations	with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist	ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary.	3.4686231031381736
660. with a democratic administration party patronage would normally begin	to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity	in the november election.	5.272730306193222
661. now the picture is clouded and even	us sens james o eastland and john c stennis who	remained loyal to the ticket are uncertain of their status.	3.423365028408623
662. reports are that it is more than probability that the four congressmen	from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped	of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen.	5.690803624341232
663. the gov jimmie h davis administration	appears to face a difficult year in 1961 with the governor's	theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses.	3.230413762819975
664. the	year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome	issue.	5.8632743840306984
665. but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue-	that of finances in state government.	3.917245792743782
666. the transition from segregation	to finances might already be in progress in the form of an administration	proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3	per cent.	4.867901677670636
667. the administration has said the sales tax proposal	is merely part of the segregation strategy since the revenues from the	increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program.	3.5821076944047996
668. but the	tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused	legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all	shortage of cash than to segregation.	5.264680491490441
669. indeed the administration's curious position on the sales tax was	a major factor in contributing to its defeat.	4.089200657519639
670. the administration could	not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program.	5.337521705786868
671. the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies	revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining	whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote.	3.591425376281258
672. the	tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when	the legislature reconvenes.	6.035004651227389
673. davis may use the tax bill as a	means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature	to normalcy.	3.630741438221849
674. if it fails to pass he can throw up his hands and	say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent	integration.	5.871974368487339
675. he could terminate special sessions of the legislature.	4.879773744318929
676. actually	davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway.	6.798788752299113
677. many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing	battle to block token integration.	3.5876071182944287
678. this is not the sort	of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly.	6.588128487144804
679. they would	like to convey the notion something is being done even though it is	something they know to be ineffectual.	4.220282783062649
680. passage	of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect	a transition.	6.002671757498668
681. he could tell the legislature they had provided the	needed funds to carry on the battle.	4.099698372223867
682. then he could tell them to	go home while the administration continued to wage the battle with	the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in	over an eight months period.	5.143397387140668
683. it is difficult to be certain how	the administration views that $28 million since the views of one leader	may not be the same as the views of another one.	4.0186069914852505
684. but if	the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a	grant-in-aid program a not unlikely conclusion it could very well seek	a way to use the money for other purposes.	5.567009520027779
685. this would be in	perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration-	the shortage of cash.	3.859795250379719
686. it could become an acute problem in the coming	fiscal year.	7.325178468062477
687. if the administration does not succeed in passing	the sales tax bill or any other tax bill it could very well be	faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting	dilemma.	3.7764784315771625
688. since the constitution forbids introduction	of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have	to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues.	5.144752362761134
689. in either case it could call a special session	of the legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising	additional revenues through a tax raiser.	3.5586965685585352
690. the prospect of cutting	back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor.	5.292452005330277
691. it is one	that most try to avoid as long as they can see an alternative approach	to the problem.	4.163396081332094
692. but if all alternatives should be clearly	blocked	off it can be expected the davis administration will take steps	to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature.	6.507085309339803
693. this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by	the trims to exert pressure on the legislature so it would be more	receptive to a tax proposal later in the year.	3.9236905307455774
694. a constant problem	confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge	by his foes that he has not tried to economize.	5.7018198659014745
695. any tax bill	also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using	their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves.	3.678480298230131
696. the new year might see some house-cleaning either genuine or	token depending upon developments to give davis an opportunity to	combat some of these criticisms.	5.224542002871126
697. city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the	bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage	of a private contracting company which had an inside track	with the city.	3.082467594581897
698. estimates of the city's loss in the $344000	job have ranged as high as $200000.	5.774084110435825

700. the hughes	concern then took shortcuts on the project but got paid anyway	hemphill said.	5.083130901445894

705. managing director donald	c wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with hemphill after a	period of sharp disagreement on the matter.	3.2967850012312816
706. the announcement	that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made	by city solicitor david berger at a press conference following	a meeting in the morning with wagner and other officials of the city	and the ptc as well as representatives of an engineering firm that	was pulled off the el project before its completion in 1959.	4.625205481274254

718. the bid from a belanger and sons of cambridge mass	which listed the same officers as hughes was $600 per joint.	4.487173737304754
719. but hemphill added bids from other contractors ranged from $2400	to $3100 per joint.	3.562738583139583

1212. but he also achieved something that endeared	him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot.	5.762648318511387
1213. a couple of weeks ago	he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole.	3.8885025384838765
1214. and	it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were	meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving	them to despair.	5.100374857934807
1215. if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could	commit such a scoring sacrilege there was hope left for all.	3.601057991341832
1216. it	was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden	that motivated arnold.	5.636053953348648
1217. he merely became victimized by a form	of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all.	3.5671725935858607
1218. the world's	best golfer shooting below par came to the last hole of the opening	round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering	a final crusher.	4.950336101986256

1226. each	of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes.	5.92145583205886
1227. so he wound up with a	dozen.	6.243521222968348
1228. it was a nice round figure that 12 he said as	he headed for the clubhouse not too much perturbed.	5.896333300923399
1229. from the	standpoint of the army of duffers however this was easily the most heartening	exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways	during his heyday and scored an 11 in the texas open.	3.349113588583036
1230. the idol of	the hackers of course is ray ainsley who achieved a 19 in the united	states open.	5.363239135396965
1231. their secondary hero is another pro willie chisholm	who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his	way out of a rock-strewn gully.	3.522418436475794
1232. willie's partner was long jim barnes	who tried to keep count.	5.6786259566727235

1234.  asked willie at one stage of his excavation project.	6.90686954373774
1235. nae man	said willie ye must be countin' the echoes.	3.798865284762364
1236. palmer's dozen were honestly earned.	6.706346045260558
1237. nor were there any rules	to save him.	4.871778940729356
1238. if there had been he would have found a loophole because	arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man	who wrote the book.	5.865991075369407
1239. this knowledge has come in handy too.	4.934107395918842

1242. arnold sent for	joe dey the executive secretary of the golf association.	6.95645960826442
1243. joe naturally	ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had	originally entered the stream.	3.464829908029781
1244. i knew it all along confessed	arnold with a grin but i just happened to think how much	nicer it would be to drop one way up there.	5.949237505292245
1245. for a serious young	man who plays golf with a serious intensity palmer has such an	inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves	from jangling like banjo strings.	3.3045436742610845
1246. yet he remains the fiercest of competitors.	7.18832593259111
1247. he'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure	he's right.	4.070498373213329
1248. that's how he first won the masters in 1958.	6.390205790538454
1249. it happened on the twelfth hole a 155-yarder.	4.942041964266569
1250. arnold's iron shot	from	the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green an embankment	that had become soft and spongy from the rains thereby bringing local	rules into force.	4.499218445453412
1251. i can remove the ball	can't i?	5.475006286702336
1252.  asked palmer of an official.	8.443784011247995
1253. you must play it where it lies.	5.625503681386586
1254. you're	wrong said arnold a man who knows the rules.	7.220269329183475
1255. i'll do	as you say but i'll also play a provisional ball and get a	ruling.	3.5794351365709933
1256. he scored a 4 for the embedded ball a 3 with the provisional	one.	5.703352481167194
1257. the golfing fathers ruled in his favor.	3.6053129342280075
1258. so he picked up a stroke	with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of	that stroke.	5.827608943767283
1259. until a few weeks ago however arnold palmer	was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers.	3.8947036106144255
1260. but after that 12 at los angeles he became one of the boys a bigger	hero than he ever had been before.	6.559822143855932
1261. a formula to supply players for the new minneapolis vikings	and	the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will	be discussed by national football league owners at a meeting at the	hotel warwick today.	3.2317880124369616

2288. probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment	community in years was the morton foods stock issue which was	sold to the public during the past week.	5.8447665216954
2289. for many reasons the	demand to buy shares in the dallas-headquartered company was tremendous.	4.115106672209909
2290. it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the	stock; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers	and explaining to others why they had no more to sell.	5.790717965132662
2291. investors	who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 and customers	who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100	and counted themselves lucky to get that many.	3.1382086783676426
2292. in fact very	few customers anywhere in the nation were able to get more than 100	shares.	7.381005486056325
2293. some dallas investment firms got only 100 shares for all of	their customers.	3.973829176014313
2294. a measure of how hot the stock was can be	found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began.	6.6597088925597046
2295. the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.	3.7115556221423267
2296. the first over-the-counter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler	guerin + turner the managing underwriter was at $17 a share.	4.7282160520760925
2297. and	from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday	morning at around $22 a share.	3.4993555230758244
2298. but the morton foods issue	was hot long before it was on the market.	7.409446821510798
2299. indeed from the moment the	reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last	january the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up.	3.4130721831854762
2300. letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the	nation all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would	be sold	.	6.035560592994177
2301. there was even	a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned	about the dallas stock offering.	3.6573478066605425
2302. we subscribe 500 shares of morton	foods of texas.	6.399977213173029
2303. cable confirmation it said translated.	4.734951756632777
2304. but	egt could not let the swiss bank have even 10 shares.	5.8488891977868915
2305. after it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group	members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone.	3.452713329895826
2306. but the result of it all was egt partner dean guerin	believes an effective distribution of the stock to owners all	over the nation.	5.821366225088891
2307. i feel confident the stock will qualify for	the 'national list' he said meaning its market price would	be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country.	3.5012614052134476
2308. he was	also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved	again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a	job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do.	5.000214127068363
2309. but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one?	4.550445085658012
2310. 	the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances.	8.712029346900374
2311. first the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last	few months driving stocks of all kinds up.	3.8278026574665254
2312. as a result it is not	easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced	10 times 1960 earnings to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64c	.	5.7807923126905
2313. second the potato chip industry	has caught the fancy of investors lately and until morton foods	came along there were only two potato chip stocks- frito and h	w lay- on the market.	3.2922588831010358
2314. both of those have had dynamic run-ups	in price on the market in recent months both were selling at higher	price-earnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market	at and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock	to have a fast run-up.	5.032519880791009
2315. and third the potato chip industry has	taken on the flavor of a growth industry in the public mind of	late.	4.0127938427082634
2316. foods which long had been considered recession resistant	but hardly dynamic stocks have been acting like growth stocks going	to higher price-earnings ratios.	4.64893324468897
2317. the potato chip industry these	days is growing not only as a	result of population increase and public	acceptance of convenience foods but also because of a combination	of circumstances	that has led to growth by merger.	3.4251129990919265
2318. the history of the	us potato chip industry is that many of today's successful	companies got started during the deep depression days.	5.413726612807406
2319. those that remain	are those that were headed by strong executives men with the abilities	to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest.	3.7048719107606725
2320. but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and	suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their	closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management	in their firms.	5.250229752673648
2321. so they go looking for mergers with other	firms that have publicly quoted stock and almost daily they pound on	the doors of firms like frito.	3.3543657525934747
2322. all those things combined to	make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is.	6.341238564704039
2323. now if morton's newest product a corn chip known as chip-o's	turns out to sell as well as its stock did the stock may turn out	to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up	to.	3.489221855691459
2324. dallas and north texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and	distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies valued in the	millions of dollars.	4.996827954869924
2325. more than 10 companies maintain facilities	in dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at	sherman.	4.278888196967074

2712. it's much more complex than that.	6.829997246283145
2713. generally they go to school with	a girl named gloriana who lives down the block and has a car.	4.280468244378444
2714. this is a way of getting to school but i understand it entails	a certain loss of social status.	6.683276020120383
2715. a young man doesn't like to be driven	up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even	in a higher class than he is and is also a girl.	4.1912578186643925

2728. i've tried to compromise	by letting them take the little car now and then.	5.760586014566176

2735. the	logic of that is impeccable of course except that i feel like a	fool being driven up to work in a little car by my wife when everybody	knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself.	3.618012949722548
2736. the	solution naturally is the bus.	7.120307725681116

2760. here's an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute	and is completely charming using puppets for lamp bases.	4.912502476503571
2761. most children	love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies and	they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action rather than	put away in boxes.	3.5323640419885844
2762. displayed as lamps the puppets delight the children	and are decorative accent.	5.350800332986632
2763. to create such a lamp order	a wired pedestal from any lamp shop.	3.8428784272157763
2764. measure the puppet to determine	the height of the light socket allowing three to four inches above the	puppet's head.	5.3966612245736245
2765. make sure that the metal tube through which the wire	passes is in the shape of an inverted l the foot of the	l about three inches long so that the puppet can hang directly	under the light.	3.931408492063292

2768. if the puppets are of uniform size you can change them	in accord with your child's whims.	5.552583543057015
2769. although a straight drum	shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could	be changed without disharmony it is far more fun to create shades	in the gay spirit of a child's playtime.	3.452925749381013

2866. the leningrad kirov ballet which opened a series of performances	friday night at the opera house is i think the finest classical	ballet company i have ever seen and the production of	the petipa-tschaikowsky sleeping beauty with which it began	the series is incomparably the finest i have ever had the pleasure of	witnessing.	5.009877886130008
2867. this work is no favorite of mine.	4.651066396125129
2868. i am prepared	to demonstrate at an ytime that it represents the spirit of imperial	russia in its most vulgar infantile and reactionary aspect; that	its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates	that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was;	that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot	to boobify the american people; that its choreography is undistinguished	and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms.	4.819400095056233

2874. it is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address	toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to	the american ballet.	5.880629779201423
2875. oh-the-pain-of-it that convention of russian	ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters	of impoverished grand dukes driven to thestage out of filial piety	is totally absent from the kirov.	3.418197327193674
2876. this is all the more remarkable	because the kirov is to ballet what senator goldwater is to american	politics.	6.188407931221125

3030. he would come home in	the evening tired and discouraged- in no frame of mind to play with	their three children or spend much time chatting with his wife.	5.010405929077628
3031. hurt by his lack of interest and attention mary complained often	that he didn't help around the house and that he didn't really	care about the family.	3.6962143671602288
3032. she accused him of ignoring her.	7.334970969599176
3033. he in turn told	her she demanded too much.	4.256148747925602

3035. mary decided she had had enough.	5.346334029929856
3036. without any definite	plan in mind she went to a judge to see what could be done.	6.594361889475498
3037. the	judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations-	then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from	family	service before going to a lawyer.	3.4342722969288237
3038. family service sharing	in ugf has five agencies in the washington area.	6.2835486198465444

3041. for nearly a year they have been receiving	counseling separately and together in an effort to understand and	overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce.	3.9721016057662983
3042. the interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of	the problems confronting the other.	5.649373908320655
3043. they are now working together toward	solving their difficulties.	4.62392850199561
3044. john received a promotion	in his firm.	7.485150894949614
3045. he gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on	life.	4.437360678110679
3046. mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings	and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session	of happy family rough-housing.	4.923173495072063
3047. to outsiders the blacks seem	to be an ordinary happy family and they are- but with a difference.	3.9740215755670376
3048. they know the value of being just that- an ordinary happy family.	7.162149877073151
3049. family service has helped hundreds of families in this	area.	4.45531181143778
3050. perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital.	7.310529370804082
3051. but	to the families it serves their help cannot be measured.	3.8451637145886166
3052. family service	could not open its doors to a single family without the financial	support of the united givers fund.	6.281899857225299
3053. anticipated heavy traffic along the skyline drive failed to	materialize yesterday park rangers said and those who made the trip	got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze.	3.412293662703271
3054. one of the initial questions put to president	kennedy at his first news conference last january was about his	attitude toward a meeting with premier khrushchev.	5.616834068245108
3055. mr kennedy	replied:    i'm hopeful that from  more traditional	exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground.	3.5130129589157004
3056. the	president knew that a confrontation with mr khrushchev sooner or	later probably was inevitable and even desirable.	5.72908099590347
3057. but he was convinced	that the realities of power- military economic and ideological-	were the decisive factors in the struggle with the communists and that	these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting.	3.7615932832225076
3058. he	wanted to buy time to strengthen the u s and its allies and	to define and begin to implement his foreign policy.	5.626174774158815
3059. last friday	the white house announced:   president kennedy will	meet	with soviet premier nikita s khrushchev in vienna june 3 and	4.	3.5752825648811664
3060. the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration	in east-west relations.	5.649883557145511
3061. the heightened tension in fact had been	a major factor in the president's change of view about the urgency	of a meeting with the soviet leader.	3.52900151419362
3062. he was not going to vienna	to negotiate- the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow	last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned.	5.6303669482446566
3063. but	mr kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with	mr khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe.	4.270870281661709
3064. that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting.	6.111903792029034
3065. despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance	of the meeting it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters	of the cold war.	4.349468864842499
3066. the u s and	soviet heads of government have met three times since sir winston	churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy	with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace at the	summit of the nations.	5.103293842217424
3067. the first time was in 1955 when a	full-dress big four summit meeting produced the spirit of geneva.	4.234912436758881
3068. the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads	into the middle east.	4.94363935443499
3069. in 1959 president eisenhower	and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the u s.	4.315668816967825
3070. that meeting produced the spirit of camp david- a spirit it	later turned out that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress	toward a berlin settlement.	5.28705792624544
3071. on the third occasion- another	big four summit session at paris a year ago- there was no problem	of an illusory spirit.	3.9705170757912778
3072. premier khrushchev wrecked the conference	at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the u s	for the u-2 incident.	5.231892791830433
3073. the episode tended to confirm the u	s belief that propaganda the hope of one-sided concessions and	the chance to split the allies rather than genuine negotiation were	the soviet leader's real aims in summitry.	2.9453160530350537
3074. thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration	that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president mr	kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem.	6.172830607505129
3075. shortly before his	nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations	with the soviet leader in these words:   as long	as mr khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is	shifting his way no amount of either smiles or toughness neither camp	david talks nor kitchen debates can compel him to enter fruitful	negotiations.	3.386973435052796
3076. the president had set for himself the task which	he believed vital of awakening the u s and its allies to	the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance.	5.308055692683041
3077. he did	not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make	it unnecessary.	3.540553286494962
3078. he wanted time too to review the united states'	global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited	and new ones he was formulating.	5.092197694067954
3079. above all he did not want to appear	to be running hat in hand to premier khrushchev's doorstep.	4.258197931209974
3080. flexible	at the same time the president took pains not to	rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader.	6.30337405163991
3081. ideally he knew	it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels.	3.8440320256131484
3082. but mr	kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting provided that undue	hopes were not raised in connection with it.	5.409935679629485
3083. it would give him an	opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war	to try to probe mr khrushchev's intentions and to make clear	his own views.	3.9827325086059027
3084. moreover an eventual meeting was desirable if for no	other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u s was not	inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions.	5.35732577774337
3085. both elements- the caution about a meeting the willingness	eventually to hold one- were reflected in a letter from the president	which ambassador llewellyn e thompson brought back to russia	late in february.	3.4797683600394094
3086. the letter dated feb 22 was delivered to	premier khrushchev in novosibirsk siberia on march 9.	4.591144753797623
3087. it dealt	mainly with a broad range of east-west issues.	4.8252164310216035
3088. but it also briefly	suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr khrushchev before	the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and	schedules permitted.	6.95739288904206
3089. developments over the next two months however	caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing.	4.549558172273223
3090. there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house	about the advisability of an early meeting not because the international	climate was improving but precisely because it was deteriorating	alarmingly.	5.709198009951288
3091. the president was especially	concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at	geneva.	3.7408850180565336
3092. the deadlock has been caused by the russians' new demand	for a three-man directorate and thus a veto	over the control machinery.	4.8473176477087865
3093. in the u s strong pressures	have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians	may be secretly testing.	4.213577843495085
3094. mr kennedy was less troubled	by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown	or even continued stalemate would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear	weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament.	5.356126075887626
3095. there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was	also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons particularly	to communist china.	4.254510314224975
3096. the question arose as to whether a frank discussion	of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent.	5.582512694027568
3097. moreover	moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle	to the executive organs of all international bodies including	the u n secretariat and the international control commission	for laos.	3.322122759925036
3098. mr kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand	would make international agreements or even negotiations impossible.	5.8889498505273
3099. developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability	of an early summit meeting.	3.791147643312263
3100. initially the white house reaction	was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict	in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting.	5.109001050426536
3101. at the same time	there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader	as a result of those episodes come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion	about the west's ability and determination to resist communist	pressure.	3.6364715623863524
3102. in cuba the u s had blundered badly and	created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even	on its own doorstep.	5.627714058077753
3103. in laos the picture was almost equally bad.	4.780514159148183
3104. u s willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier	khrushchev to believe that other areas could be neutralized	on soviet terms.	5.969554351072665
3105. beyond that allied disagreement about military intervention	in laos- despite warnings that they might do so- allowed	moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic	moves that greatly strengthened the pro-communist forces.	3.2761317899867564
3106. as a result	the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva	negotiations on laos and south vietnam and other nations in southeast	asia are under increased pressure.	5.362264813809313
3107. in the light of those	events there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev	might overreach himself.	4.455276561404584
3108. ambassador thompson reported from moscow	that the soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive.	5.38600976190469
3109. he has indicated	that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out.	4.053472838902798
3110. the	president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn	premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such	as berlin iran or latin america from which there would be no turning	back.	5.574343473549324
3111. it was in the midst of such white house deliberations	that premier khrushchev on may 4 made new inquiries through the	u s embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in	the near future.	3.7451545933112125
3112. mr kennedy told moscow he would give his answer	by may 20 after consultation with the allies.	5.806309471192271
3113. the response from	london paris and bonn was favorable.	3.454365590977504
3114. firm arrangements for the meeting	in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and	washington last week.	5.198951204492282
3115. apparently at the insistence of the u s	the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow	last friday emphasized the informal nature of the meeting.	4.004065005475401
3116. the	washington announcement said:    the president and chairman	khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose	of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems	that involve the interest of many other countries.	5.261007076583973
3117. the meeting	will however afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first	personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the	major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries.	3.148679533595272
3118. the vienna meeting will bring together a	seasoned	67-year-old veteran of the cold war who in mr kennedy's	own words is shrewd tough vigorous well-informed and confident	and a 44-year-old president with a	demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international	diplomacy.	4.495707889799546
3119. the announcement last week of the forthcoming	encounter produced strong reactions in the u s of both approval	and disapproval.	3.900338487937228
3120. the approval did not arise from an expectation	of far-reaching agreements at vienna.	5.021449457352624
3121. the inclination was to accept	the statement that there would be no formal negotiations.	3.8436830218433102
3122. but those	who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between	the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary.	5.869900096732793
3123. mr khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about	his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men.	4.2753231827390765
3124. the feeling was	that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the	president and that plain talk by mr kennedy would give him pause.	4.7698197753644
3125. apart from the personal equation another reason advanced	in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the us	appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit.	4.054282363820269
3126. premier khrushchev	has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got	his summit meeting anyway.	6.748697030252575
3127. this time the initiative came in part	at least from washington.	4.476351682831857
3128. there was also	the fact that by the time he meets mr khrushchev the president	will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied	leaders.	6.1124296035836885
3129. thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader	of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity.	4.315645259914787
3130. finally	there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the president's	making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test	accord.	5.798554804667707
3131. there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings	throughout the world.	4.211651042873786
3132. if tests are to be resumed the argument went	it is vital that the u s make plain that the onus belongs to	the soviet union.	5.942995075580866
3133. disapproval of the meeting was based largely	on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse.	4.167578211107383
3134. after cuba	and laos it was argued mr khrushchev will interpret the president's	consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness-	perhaps even panic- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage	he now believes he holds.	4.9114411040059185
3135. moreover the president is meeting the	soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided	on the scope of america's firm foreign policy commitments.	4.05978543383272
3136. the	question was raised for example as to what attitude the president	would take if mr khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending	from southeast asia to the middle east.	4.92446592002412
3137. there are so my biologist friends tell me mechanisms of	adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory.	3.513350741494415
3138. mollusks are a case in point.	7.031123718096013
3139. the shell which served the strain	so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme tended	to cancel out the possibility of future development.	3.3224800889820854
3140. though this may	or may not be good biology it does aptly illustrate the strength and	the weakness of american catholic higher education.	5.822499643467633
3141. there can	be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field	of higher education is most impressive: our european brethren never	cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities.	3.9494031488173036
3142. the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades	rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that.	4.562985726458618
3143. by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement	stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which	brought the parochial school system into existence.	3.576162215217058
3144. there	is however one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture.	5.947441294525062
3145. viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect	we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school	to university.	3.539089185768209
3146. but the simple truth is that higher education has	never really been an official american catholic project; certainly	not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school	system has been a matter of official policy.	5.9630575696824515
3147. official encouragement	is one thing but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan	and parochial funds.	3.53461912918501
3148. american catholics have responded generously	to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to	create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar	fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning.	5.223074406975137
3149. they	have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly	ever been made.	3.777133994184549
3150. diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this	as their direct responsibility.	5.568001987532488
3151. all of this may be understandable	enough: it is however in fact difficult to see how diocesan	authorities could have acted otherwise.	4.420339640280291
3152. yet for better or for worse	the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do	not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to	the initiative resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious	communities.	5.195501874890486
3153. community esprit de corps has been the protective	shell which has made the achievement possible.	4.590120374438274
3154. to understand	the past history- and the future potential- of american catholic	higher education it is necessary to appreciate the special character	of the esprit d' corps of the religious community.	5.300604431389719
3155. it is something	more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and	detachment.	3.69584890329597
3156. a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves	a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found	elsewhere.	5.1903466107419245
3157. the fact that the group orientation and group identification	are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs	of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension.	3.38288457539172
3158. the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship	the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting	edge of sacrifice and hardship.	4.69065062261539
3159. american catholic colleges	and universities are in a very real sense the product of private	enterprise- the private enterprise of religious communities.	4.3904629068903835
3160. had it not been for such private enterprise diocesan authorities	might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized	by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious	as paid employees.	4.980689119899757
3161. there is however no point in speculating about such	a possibility: the fact of the matter is that our institutions of	higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which	produces the family business.	3.528470294802715
3162. this family-community spirit	is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement.	5.813535238013658
3163. it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american	catholic higher education in particular the wasteful duplication	apparent in some areas.	3.7935405688862756
3164. i think for example of three women's colleges	with pitifully small enrollments clustered within a few miles of	a major catholic university which is also co-educational.	5.618540676999646
3165. this is not	an isolated example; this aspect of the total picture has been commented	upon often enough.	4.2028119919492735
3166. it would seem to represent esprit de corps	run riot.	7.930006936339878
3167. apart however from the question of wasteful duplication	there is another aspect of the family business spirit	in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny.	4.333112445915983
3168. for while the past needs of the church in this country may have	been adequately met by collegiate institutions which in temper and tone	closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools it would	seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles	the university in its pursuit of excellence.	5.288115817909705
3169. at the earlier	pre-academic excellence stage of catholic education the operation	could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis.	3.572480755795189
3170. but with today's	demand for professional qualifications and specialized training	the need for outsiders become more pressing.	5.52276003208834
3171. the problem	is not merely that more outside teachers are needed but	that a different brand is called for.	3.299966426610273
3172. commenting on the earlier stage	the notre dame chapter of the american association of university	professors	noted that the term teacher-employee	was	a not inapt description.	5.404461370785299
3173. today however the outsider is likely	to have professional qualifications of the highest order	and to be acclimatized	to the democratic processes of the secular or state university.	3.5128265941871204
3174. and	while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene the scholar	will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second	class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank	or professional achievement.	4.734546810333523
3175. in the above mentioned report of	the notre dame chapter of the american association of university	professors the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges	very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see	it: even with the best of intentions he	is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to	a group the membership of which considered in	individual terms is inhomogeneous mortal and of extremely varying	temperament interests and capabilities.	3.436655752191438
3176. it is natural that he should	turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization	which actually owns the university and whose goals are in	their opinion identified with its highest good and	'the attainment of excellence'.	4.702630815178525
3177. the pattern	here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame: it is simply	that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution	by the organization which actually owns it becomes more obvious	where there is a larger and more distinguished outside faculty.	3.2868337975086592
3178. it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report	should refer to the organization which actually owns the university:	this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more	to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension.	5.641246243851241
3179. but	in any case one does not have to read very closely between the lines	to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy	one.	4.155500538580597
3180. outside faculty members want to be considered partners in	the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business.	6.332084568033781
3181. there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with	this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university.	4.217990530112556
3182. in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber	personnel.	7.367715355957117
3183. word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession	much given to attending meetings and conferences.	3.52971533883427
3184. expressions	of even low-key dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member	has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype.	5.072111114191032
3185. in	the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or	a boycott: all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines	to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions	at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere.	3.714615554339046
3186. to appreciate the nature of the gamble it should be realized	that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security	that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does	in an elementary school system or in the civil service.	5.613236119815163
3187. much has	been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee	firm tenure.	4.955481348423054
3188. this is a significant advance but its import should not	be exaggerated.	6.562157421560804
3189. when a man invests a block of his years at a university	without gaining the coveted promotion not only is he faced with the	problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in	the market value of his services.	3.6750237288166168
3190. a man does not make that kind of	gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure	positions is being reserved for members of the family.	5.8905282196785365
3191. just	as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new	tenure practices it is also possible to exaggerate the significance	of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions.	3.789409389105648
3192. yet adequate compensation-	and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute	for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his	earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place.	5.17005069784226
3193. broadly	speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible	but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature	responsibility in the total work of the university.	3.632091648869841
3194. religious who	derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious	community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate	both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this	identification.	5.036233691047721
3195. there is no need here to spell out the conditions	of creative teaching except to point out that at the college	level the sense of community and of community responsibility is even	more necessary than it is at other levels.	4.06143727962065
3196. the college teacher needs	the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also	needs to feel that such communication even informal debates over the	luncheon table are a contribution to the total good of the institution.	4.948329499095573
3197. but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from	the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation.	3.794948356559138
3198. the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy	between faculty members who are part of the in-group that owns and	operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees is	therefore the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself.	5.529690320141213
3199. this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary	and tenure.	4.555119660012508
3200. yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive	resolution of the problem of ownership and control there are nevertheless	certain suggestions which seem to be in order.	6.4502079608365435
3201. the first	is a negative warning: there is no point in the creation of faculty	committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real	authority.	3.5527125335535894
3202. in the case of academic personnel the feeling of	participation can hardly be faked.	6.6192360157964485
3203. competent teachers are well	versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without	destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own	decisions.	3.4635202860945222
3204. those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar	with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to	be taken in by busy-work and ersatz decision making.	5.1577987186916605
3205. in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of	participation are what is called for at all.	4.108436093935975
3206. in the notre dame report	reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced	to luncheon-table communication.	6.622567600152441
3207. in itself there is nothing wrong	with this form of participation: the only difficulty on the	catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position	to implement policy ie members of the religious community which	owns and administers the institution have their own eating arrangements.	3.5582347743286222
3208. sen john l mcclellan of arkansas and rep david	martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions	under the anti-monopoly laws.	4.791314760802867
3209. once more the fallacious equation is advanced	to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly	laws there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions:	the law must treat everybody equally.	3.349435288679928
3210. or in the words of anatole	france the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich	as well as the poor from begging in the streets and sleeping under	bridges.	5.833703863975562
3211. the public atmosphere that has been generated which	makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute	into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr mcclellan's	hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and later	into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations	at the missile sites.	3.2899888464561187
3212. the senator was shocked by stoppages over	allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program.	4.646534693748167
3213. in addition	disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess	of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation	on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill.	3.412242944749804
3214. it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages but	he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes	to fight a strike.	5.130811480888589
3215. business week reports that	the united aircraft company against which the international association	of machinists had undertaken a strike decided to keep its plants	operating.	3.3826688063077506
3216. the company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable	to four factors: advertising to attract new employees hiring	and training them extra overtime and defective work performed by	the new workers.	4.359660600693865
3217. the company has billed the united states government	for $7500000 of these expenses under the defense department regulation	allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and	necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business.	3.594325926981818
3218. rep	frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the	attention of the armed services committee.	5.561859774358151
3219. neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan	been heard from on the matter; they are preoccupied with ending labor	abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions.	3.331883603170109
3220. the	recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution	of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers	has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified	neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained.	4.868843870773248
3221. the	anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete but along completely	undefined lines; it must play a game in which there never is	a winner.	3.5405995550267693
3222. the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully	cannot follow the law.	6.0080573870007115
3223. hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a	foolish public policy.	4.322036295544336
3224. let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods	industry in which general electric westinghouse and a number of	other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy	to rig prices and allocate the market.	5.204793761667607
3225. the industry is so structured	that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way	overhead charges are allocated- whether marginal or average pricing	is applied.	2.927594973535977
3226. the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise	is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods	in addition to the heavy electrical equipment.	5.969628367942773
3227. accounting procedures	can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price.	4.072832078834195
3228. naturally	enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to	structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors	can be forced to the wall in a very short time.	6.146989682656581
3229. should these giants	really flex their competitive muscles they would become the only	survivors in the industry.	3.7682714648809315
3230. uncle sam would then accuse them of creating	a monopoly by unfair competition.	5.6810764253598
3231. but if they show self-restraint	they don't get the orders.	4.718371433511175
3232. under the circumstances	the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage	in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter	were convicted.	5.705625634209654
3233. engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy	by the giants.	4.459954034708341
3234. the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by	the demand of the government after the conviction that general electric	sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices	so low as to compete seriously with its fellows.	4.994767171360698
3235. in other words	the anti-trust laws designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday	wednesday and friday become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer	on tuesday thursday and saturday.	3.504366773765636
3236. and which theory would	govern the enforcers of the law on sunday?	6.550878332741067
3237. 	the question	might be asked: don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods	manufacturers know these facts?	3.3222405564516344
3238.  why did they engage in a	flood of mea culpas throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise	to be good boys thereafter expressing their complete confidence in	the laws?	4.926563454908505
3239.    the past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to	management was explained by thurman arnold in the folklore of capitalism	back in 1937.	3.046442818969945
3240. he wrote:  h the anti-trust	laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need	of great organizations and at the same time had to deny them a place	in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure.	5.245824005029941
3241. h anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled	business dictatorship.	4.1755404241603395
3242. h when corporate abuses were attacked	it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked	rather than control.	5.556789746654999
3243. h in this manner every scheme for direct	control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust	laws.	3.9625674334482555
3244. h in any event it is obvious that the anti-trust	laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial	empires the world has ever known held together by some of the most	fantastic ideas all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation	is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control	by the government.	5.653955399561068
3245. this escape from control has led to management's	evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as	worth while.	3.7607496491496955
3246. a plea of nolo contendere followed by a nominal fine	after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license.	5.718754048717879
3247. penalties handed out in the electrical case which included jail	sentences were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions perhaps because	the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing	if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control	of a fictitious impersonal market quite obviously some method must	be devised for representing the public interest.	2.9599218406863805
3248. a secret conspiracy	of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle.	5.9625871373257375
3249. however one can argue that	no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust	laws are effective and rational.	3.77754126470039
3250. quite clearly the anti-trust laws	are neither effective nor rational- and yet the argument goes that	they should be extended to the labor union.	5.169973101726081
3251. those who	favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating	a brand new reform.	3.94718245855031
3252. before 1933 individuals who opposed	trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english.	5.820831693311894
3253. the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934	implicit in the writing of section 7a of the national industrial	recovery act has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining	in principle.	3.31134604734169
3254. the wagner act the taft-hartley act and the landrum-griffin	act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining.	5.123004611028891
3255. the basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system	is the removal of wages from competition.	3.6796171362912466
3256. if a union cannot perform	this function then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers	as a gigantic fraud.	5.347447454760541
3257. the tortured reasoning that unions	use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply	and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession.	3.344080612045148
3258. the problem must be faced squarely.	6.636730652971867
3259. if laborers are merely commodities	competing against each other in a market place like so many bags	of wheat and corn	then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism	to a system that imposes such status upon them.	3.4375280357925018
3260. human labor	was exactly that- a commodity- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century	america.	5.2661161748705725
3261. as early as 1776 adam smith wrote in the wealth of	nations: we have no acts of parliament against combining	to lower the price of work; but many against combining to raise it.	3.50395917298139
3262. eighteenth-century england upon whose customs our common law was	built had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies.	4.793496332095254
3263. in 1825	the boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced	by the organized employers who declared: it is h considered	that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to h effect	the value of labor h tend to convert all its branches into monopolies.	2.940824323782702
3264. there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for	collective bargaining but against labor monopoly.	5.88973600734977
3265. the courts	shared the opinion of the employers.	4.015582677255437
3266. in people vs fisher justice	savage of the new york supreme court declared:   without	any officious and improper interference on the subject the	price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand	for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid	for it; but the right does not exist to raise h the wages of the mechanic	by any forced and artificial means.	5.115504328558228
3267. compare this statement	of a nineteenth-century judge with how congressman martin according	to the daily labor report of sept 19 1961 defends	the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor	if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages production or	prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his	employees to contract on wages hours and conditions of employment.	3.178681271124029
3268. senator mcclellan is proposing the application of anti-trust	measures to unions in transportation.	5.7562966795076775
3269. his bill allegedly aimed at	hoffa would amend the sherman clayton and norris-laguardia acts	to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation	strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert	with any other union- even a sister local in the same international.	3.120792349371645
3270. paradoxically the same week in which senator mcclellan was	attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation	the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they	met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel the action	would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act.	4.501813922702027
3271. indeed it	is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently	granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws; for example	the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the	encouragement of railroads to seek mergers.	3.3712300266254562
3272. at the very moment that	every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality	of anti-trust legislation a drive is on to abolish collective	bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions	who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that	ship operators set freight rates.	5.337634927834514
3273. the passage of the	sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies.	3.4935875256570763
3274. it was most effective against	trade unions.	7.4747406709123725
3275. in the famous danbury hatters case a suit was	brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices	eg trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product	of the struck manufacturer.	3.2305633721143177
3276. the suit against the union was successful	and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment.	5.302605447513956
3277. in 1914 the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under	the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be	considered a commodity.	3.4374059935247745
3278. the law could not suspend economics.	6.16654539616432
3279. labor remained	a commodity- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization	from the anti-trust laws.	3.5129352801479756
3280. the courts by interpretation	emasculated the act.	5.508439452073732
3281. in 1922 the united mine workers struck the	coronado coal company.	3.8769347613893164
3282. the company sued under the anti-trust laws	alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of	interstate commerce.	4.933878834899276
3283. the	court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference	with commerce.	3.7081572472216973
3284. at a closed-door session	on capitol hill last week secretary of state christian herter made	his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on	us affairs abroad.	5.573234346448845
3285. afterward tennessee's democratic senator	albert gore summed it up for newsmen.	3.768733372049379
3286. what herter presented	said gore was not a very encouraging review.	7.288537580112927
3287. that was something	of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between	the west and communism erupted on three fronts.	3.805338138936194
3288. while communists	were undermining united nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos	two other communist offensives stirred the eisenhower administration	hours after a parade of his new soviet tanks and artillery dictator	fidel castro suddenly confronted the us with a blunt and	drastic demand: within 48 hours the us had to reduce its	embassy and consulate staffs in cuba to a total of eleven persons	embassy staff alone totaled 87 us citizens plus 120 cuban	.	4.423775127419892
3289. president eisenhower held an 8:30 am meeting with	top military and foreign-policy advisers decided to break off diplomatic	relations immediately.	3.559533787012707
3290. there is a limit to what the united	states in self-respect can endure said the president.	6.705505909316451
3291. that limit	has now been reached.	5.497337607417434
3292. through secretary herter ike	offered president-elect kennedy an opportunity to associate his new	administration with the breakoff decision.	5.61368437563455
3293. kennedy through secretary-designate	of state dean rusk declined.	4.72566450367538
3294. he thus kept his hands	free for any action after jan 20 although reaction to the break	was generally favorable in the us and latin america	after a white house huddle	between the president and top lieutenants the defense department reacted	sharply to a cry from the pro-western government of laos that	several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north	viet nam.	4.733439492941366
3295. in view of the present situation in laos said the	pentagon's announcement we are taking normal precautionary actions	to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific.	3.9223009349771436
3296. cutting	short a holiday at hong kong the aircraft carriers lexington	and bennington steamed off into the south china sea accompanied	by a swarm of destroyers plus troopships loaded with marines.	4.462616041254469
3297. on the us's island base of okinawa task force 116 made	up of army navy marine and air force units got braced to move	southward on signal.	3.2437717234053185
3298. but by week's end the laotian cry of	invasion was read as an exaggeration and	the us was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies	that a neutralist- rather than a pro-western- government might	be best for laos.	4.833218679504081
3299. there was a moral of	sorts in the laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war	fronts.	4.308647634717445
3300. political economic and military experts were all agreed that	chaotic mountainous little laos was the last place in the world	to fight a war- and they were probably right.	5.393100268236456
3301. it would be like fighting	the french and indian war all over again said one military	man.	4.2703735128968905
3302. but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground?	6.970605225919774
3303. 	at geneva in 1954 to get the war in indo-china settled the	british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands	and agreed to the setting up of a communist state north viet	nam- which then predictably became a base for communist operations	against neighboring south viet nam and laos.	3.2528899924594583
3304. the late secretary	of state john foster dulles considered the 1954 geneva agreement	a specimen of appeasement saw that resolution would be needed to	keep it from becoming a calamity for the west.	4.645701907556261
3305. he began the diplomatic	discussions that resulted in the establishment of seato.	5.063036062803569
3306. the important thing from now on he said is not to mourn the	past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern	viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout	southeast asia.	5.470060990384497
3307. russian tanks and artillery parading through	the streets of havana russian intrigue in the congo and russian	arms drops in laos	made it plain once more	that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time.	3.3603961771101036
3308. soviet premier	khrushchev sent new year's hopes for peace to president-elect	kennedy and got a cool acknowledgment in reply.	5.255569975673409
3309. considering the	state of the whole world the cold war's three exposed fronts did	not seem terribly ominous; but in senator gore's words it was	not a very encouraging situation that would confront john f	kennedy on inauguration day.	3.2704057566375333
3310. _turmoil in the	house liberal	democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled	by the house rules committee and permit the free flow of liberal	legislation to the floor.	4.937917613055836
3311. the liberal pressure bloc	had fought the	committee before and had always lost.	3.413961653789647
3312. this time they were much better	prepared and organized and the political climate was favorable.	6.2298849704336945
3313. they had the unspoken support of president-elect kennedy whose own	legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck.	4.049493658115762
3314. and counting noses they seemed to have the votes to work their will.	6.651209049136795
3315. there were two possible methods of breaching	to pack	it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock	to remove one of the conservatives- namely mississippi's	14-term william meyers colmer.	3.5431265177708475
3316. caucusing the	liberals decided to go after colmer which actually was the more drastic	course since seniority in the house is next to godliness.	5.567496417241457
3317. a dour gangling man with a choppy gait colmer looks younger than	his 70 years has gradually swung from a moderate internationalist	position	to that of a diehard conservative.	3.323171652272806
3318. he is generally and initially	suspicious of any federal project unless it happens to benefit his	gulf coast constituents.	5.52479320166931
3319. he is of course a segregationist but	he says he has never made an anti-negro speech.	4.461780310112355
3320. for 20 years he	has enjoyed his power on the rules committee.	6.5843759626619915
3321. there his vote along	with those of chairman howard smith the courtly virginia judge	and the four republican members could and often did produce a 6-6	deadlock that blocked far-out	democratic-sponsored welfare legislation	.	3.2058254680967018
3322. there was	sufficient pretext to demand colmer's ouster: he had given his	lukewarm support to the anti-kennedy electors in mississippi.	5.480161214772461
3323. reprisals	are not unheard of in such situations but the recent tendency has	been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons.	3.4441295885382206
3324. in 1949 the dixiecrats	escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against harry	truman and in 1957	after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned	for dwight eisenhower in 1956 his fellow democrats did not touch	his committee assignments although they did strip him temporarily	of his patronage.	4.316063668099937
3325. judge	smith threatened reprisal against powell.	4.54419673211925
3326. said he: we will	but speaker sam rayburn after huddling in palm beach with	president-elect kennedy decided that this year something had to be	done about the rules committee- and that he was the only man who could	do anything effective.	5.57739385762559
3327. in a tense closed-door session with	judge smith rayburn attempted to work out a compromise: to add	three new members to the rules committee	.	3.7990626670534215
3328. smith flatly rejected the offer	and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels.	5.799581203961903
3329. the next	morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and	broke the news: he would lead the fight to oust colmer whom he	is said to regard as an inferior man.	3.1199426901909115
3330. news of	rayburn's	commitment soon leaked out.	7.356765347599328
3331. when missouri's clarence cannon got	the word he turned purple.	4.18166222285336
3332. unconscionable! he shouted and	rushed off to the speaker's room to object: a dangerous precedent!	cannon a powerful conservative man brought welcome support	to the smith-colmer forces: as chairman of the appropriations	committee he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding	this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects.	4.325647961717402
3333. sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another judge	smith ally georgia's carl vinson chairman of the armed services	committee.	3.631253284073685
3334. as the battle raged in the cloakrooms	and caucuses it became clear that judge smith could lose.	5.705643108642243
3335. his	highest count of supporters numbered 72- and he needed nearly twice	that number to control the 260-member democratic caucus.	3.3949408097995386
3336. the liberals	smelling blood were faced with the necessity of winning three	big votes- in the democratic committee on committees in the full	party caucus and on the floor of the house- before they could oust	colmer.	5.34637292785968
3337. the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported	in all three arenas they seemed certain	of victory- especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash.	3.2651349408238004
3338. but in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter	of losing a costlier war.	6.166794414823889
3339. if the southerners were sufficiently aroused	they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons	from their vantage point of committee chairmanships leaving sam	rayburn leading a truncated unworkable party.	3.194266156851727
3340. with that possibility	in mind arkansas' wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a	meeting of the committee on committees and coolheaded democrats sought	to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort	of face-saving compromise.	5.024007468791271
3341. here are two old men mad at each other	and too proud to pick up the phone said a house democratic leader.	4.053560666862856
3342. one wants a little more power and the other doesn't want	to give up any.	7.3299206060622835
3343. the senate launched the	87th congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative	battle but in contrast with the house's guerrilla war it seemed	as pro forma as a capitol guide's speech.	3.109583653068379
3344. question at issue:	how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate- and	thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters?	5.070178753239407
3345.    a wide-ranging	bipartisan force- from minnesota's democratic hubert humphrey	to massachusetts' republican leverett saltonstall- was	drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats who have traditionally	used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills.	3.005675383409581
3346. new mexico's	clint anderson offered a resolution to change the senate's	notorious rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the senators present and	voting to cut off debate instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds.	5.169746624167388
3347. fair dealer humphrey upped the ante asked cloture power for a	mere majority of senators.	3.3954024917386407
3348. georgia's dick russell objected politely	and the battle was joined.	5.615827410395721
3349. privately the liberals admitted	that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage.	3.689953771626714
3350. privately	they also admitted that their hopes for clint anderson's three-fifths	modification depended on none other than republican richard nixon.	4.919593509912605
3351. in 1957 nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of	senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each	new congress and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were	not binding.	3.4916283822658287
3352. armed with the nixon opinion the senate liberals	rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate	on the filibuster battle this week.	5.181927234688283
3353. hopefully the perennial battle	of rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all.	3.622778519821134
3354. since election day vice president	richard nixon had virtually retired- by his own wish- from public	view.	5.6376542110945635
3355. but with the convening of the new congress he was the public	man again presiding over the senate until john kennedy's inauguration.	4.1508943280326065
3356. one day last week nixon faced a painful constitutional chore	that required him to officiate at a joint session of congress to	hear the official tally of the electoral college vote and then to	make sufficient declaration of the election of the man who defeated	him in the tight 1960 presidential election.	5.016612381764653
3357. nixon fulfilled his	assignment with grace then went beyond the required sufficient declaration.	3.626162461224847
3358. this is the first time in 100 years that a candidate	for the presidency announced the result of an election in which	he was defeated he said.	6.547714258658484
3359. the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do	to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves.	3.279254055290014
3360. gary player the small	trim south african was the eventual winner but in all his 25	years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the	victory to drop in his lap.	4.7216511440938715
3361. arnold palmer the defending champion lost	his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that	left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief.	3.535256669358518
3362. just when you	think you have it licked this golf course can get up and bite you	player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament.	5.3903817665286695
3363. and	that is just what happened on the last few holes.	4.9666068177165315
3364. the augusta national	golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer.	4.835320100845665
3365. player was the first to feel its teeth.	5.990277072043626
3366. after playing a splendid first	nine holes in 34- two strokes under par- on this fifth and final	day of the tournament	player's	game rapidly fell to pieces.	4.846338385744189
3367. after a journey through	woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th.	4.235311058522173
3368. he bogeyed the 15th	by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three	holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total	of 280.	4.586584337187646
3369. as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course	player was almost in tears.	4.082484199014101
3370. he could read on the nearby scoreboard	that palmer by then playing the 15th hole was leading him by a stroke.	5.3875778457468
3371. palmer had started the round four strokes behind player and at	one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes.	4.180073768199961
3372. now	all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the	biggest single paycheck in golf.	5.457363111698045
3373. when palmer hit a good straight	drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole he seemed to have the championship	won.	4.307638897698008
3374. but the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green	strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression.	5.38843788093022
3375. in trying to	hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green	past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower.	3.593557698317399
3376. afterwards	palmer told charlie coe his last-round partner that he	simply played the hole too fast.	4.974596628588171
3377. he did seem hasty on his second and	third shots but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while	coe graciously putted out giving palmer a chance to recover his	composure	which he had quite visibly lost.	3.501184298501852
3378. when the shaken palmer	finally did hit his fourth shot he overshot the hole by 15 feet.	5.35318429583394
3379. palmer was now putting merely for a tie and player who was sitting	beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman	clifford roberts' clubhouse apartment stared in amazement when	palmer missed the putt.	3.3238864449672483
3380. palmer's 281 for the four rounds	at augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest	pro but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with coe.	5.3805681865883965
3381. the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur who has been playing topnotch	tournament golf for many years refused to let the masters jitters	overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69.	3.5291042416542115
3382. at seven	until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played	seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters- four last year	and three this- without ever being out of first place.	4.758160047645227
3383. as evening	approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing	one-over-par 73 this remarkable record was still intact thanks to	his thursday and friday rounds of 68 and 69.	3.1193430233529917
3384. his three-round total	of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score a 213 by bill	collins the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing	very well all winter long.	4.938977158609708
3385. but palmer knew as did everybody	else at augusta that his streak was about to be broken.	3.7941952137430435
3386. half an hour	after he finished his round player holed out at the 18th green with	a 69 and a three-round total of 206 four strokes ahead of palmer.	5.04415232696752
3387. more than a streak had ended.	6.105480482055195
3388. long after the erratic climate	and the washed-out final round on sunday have become meteorological	footnotes the 1961 masters will be remembered as the scene of the	mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player.	5.073728350290064
3389. unlike most	such sports rivalries it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously	although this was not exactly the case.	3.9769432533312985
3390. when the winter	tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to	challenge palmer's towering prestige.	5.960538733947442
3391. as if to confirm his stature	he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments.	4.9698664604535985
3392. but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago player was	leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars and the	rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere.	5.649829910496112
3393. on the final round at	pensacola the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same	threesome and although it was far from obvious at the time the gallery	was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of	the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come.	3.916572734327394
3394. on	that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading	the tournament and as it turned out neither won it.	5.244174720854261
3395. but whichever	of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial	leader of the tour.	4.357768957871064
3396. player immediately proved he was not in the	least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer.	6.48010419801712
3397. he outplayed palmer	all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to palmer's	71.	3.854889036428872
3398. thereafter until the masters player gradually increased	his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory	at miami.	4.975076626787984
3399. when they reached augusta last week together they had	won five of the 13 tournaments to date.	4.146766425891787
3400. on thursday	the first day of the masters the contest between palmer and	player developed instantly.	6.374828172687983
3401. it was a dismal drizzly day but a good	one on which to score over the augusta national course.	3.920916112623248
3402. the usually	skiddy greens were moist and soft so the golfers were able to strike	their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward	the hole without too much worry about the consequences.	4.326668120026287
3403. palmer's 4-under-par	68 got him off to an early lead which he shared with bob rosburg.	3.8565429060214442
3404. but player was only one stroke back with a 69.	7.59861605416178
3405. even	so it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators-	unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever- that this tournament	was to be essentially a match between palmer and player.	3.308704279205737
3406. a lot	of people were still thinking about jack nicklaus the spectacular	young amateur who had a 70; or ken venturi who had a somewhat shaky	72 but was bound to do better; or rosburg whose accurate short	game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of augusta's treacheries;	or even old byron nelson whose excellent 71 made one	wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf.	4.350889676802721
3407. on	friday a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and	ugly the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus.	3.349320909796383
3408. rosburg	had started early in the day and by the time palmer and player were	on the course- separated as they were destined to be for the rest	of the weekend	by about half an hour- they could see on the numerous	scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg who ended with a	73 was not having a good day.	5.333081024197767
3409. as player began his second round	in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman his share of the gallery	was not conspicuously large for a contender.	3.6082436548211922
3410. player began with a birdie	on the first hole added five straight pars and then another birdie	at the 9th.	5.244102196454453
3411. on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of	a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament.	4.30033111005304
3412. he birdied	the 13th the 15th and the 18th- five birdies one bogey and 12 pars	for a 68.	5.031652249006857
3413. starting half an hour behind player in company with	british open champion kel nagle palmer birdied the 2nd the	9th the 13th and the 16th- four birdies one bogey and 13 pars for	a 69.	3.1270199061408146
3414. the roar of palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would	roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta only to be answered	moments later by the roar of player's gallery for a similar triumph.	4.491695706837723
3415. at one point late in the day when palmer was lining up a 25-foot	putt on the 16th a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th	green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole.	3.8451668995198
3416. without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed	palmer proceeded to sink	his 25-footer and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling	back along the intervening fairways in reply.	5.261180470897941
3417. anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way	had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing	this most difficult golf course.	3.3779450560239344
3418. it is almost axiomatic that golfers	who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots	with a vehemence bordering on violence.	5.176500717735128
3419. the bad luck that can so often	mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated	by the contemptuous boldness of these champions.	3.0106787170098004
3420. bob jones played	that way.	8.22079897051521
3421. byron nelson did hogan did.	4.636522899810671
3422. and last week at the masters	palmer and player did.	6.902987433706485
3423. as the third round of the tournament	began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest it was player's	superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead.	3.554309390743704
3424. this	day palmer had started first.	7.513822460044276
3425. as player stepped on the first tee	he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was	2 under par for the day.	4.00901157355517
3426. player immediately proceeded to follow suit.	7.785158183441676
3427. in fact he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well to go 4 under	par for the first eight holes.	4.276167146370329
3428. but player's real test came	on the ninth hole a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards.	5.199742745625415
3429. he hit a poor tee shot pulling it off into the pine woods separating	the 9th and first fairways.	3.5042315955439287
3430. having hit one of the trees the ball came	to rest not more than 160 yards out.	6.400717642496741
3431. player then had the choice of	punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling	for a bogey 5 or gambling.	3.6789174384885697
3432. the latter involved hitting a full	four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse hoping to	slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green.	5.468391115818088
3433. i was hitting	the ball well player said later and i felt strong.	4.165314646754079
3434. when	you're playing like that you'd better attack.	6.1817570250091896
3435. player attacked	with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever	forget.	3.8382421909768447
3436. it struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the	edge.	6.13433348074771
3437. from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4.	4.139392953357994
3438. palmer meanwhile had been having his troubles.	7.262921886605771
3439. they started on	the 4th hole a 220-yard par-3.	4.212261518002925
3440. on this day the wind had switched 180`	from the northwest to the southeast and nearly every shot on the	course was different from the previous few days.	5.760717907473458
3441. at the 4th tee palmer	chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club so	he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green.	3.6069807383968167
3442. his bogey 4 on this	hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought	him back to even par.	5.047712209724956
3443. starting the second nine palmer was	already four strokes behind player and knew it.	3.969146585705049
3444. when mickey charles mantle the new york yankees' man	of muscle drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers his feat touches	upon the sublime.	5.402187681935185
3445. when roger eugene maris mantle's muscular	teammate powers four home runs in a double-header his performance	merits awe.	3.7501324719064484
3446. but when tiny 145-pound albert gregory pearson of the	los angeles angels who once caught three straight fly balls in center	field because as a teammate explained the other team thought	no one was out there hits seven home runs in four months	his achievement borders	on the ridiculous.	4.550484755560003
3447. this is the year home runs	ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous.	4.452882916478138
3448. it is the year when	amiable jim gentile of the baltimore orioles ambled to the	plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and in unprecedented	style delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs; willie mays	of the san francisco giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became	the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game; the	milwaukee braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs	in three games and lost two of them; and catcher johnny blanchard	of the new york yankees matched a record with home runs in four	successive times at bat two of them as a pinch-hitter.	4.556014328996132
3449. pitchers	grumble about lively balls and lively bats the shrinking strike	zone and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal.	3.6451050006805867
3450. experts	point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american league caused	by expansion.	5.985453175919509
3451. whatever the reasons not in 30 years has a single season	produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records	home-run division.	3.692283740747113
3452. of all the records in peril one stands	apart dramatic in its making dramatic in its endurance and now	doubly dramatic in its jeopardy.	5.885168152273979
3453. this of course is baseball's most	remarkable mark: the 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible	epicure the incredible athlete george herman ruth of the	yankees.	3.373351760075731
3454. since 1927 fewer than a dozen men have made serious	runs at babe ruth's record and each in turn has been thwarted.	5.674374111431652
3455. what ultimately frustrated every challenger was ruth's amazing september	surge.	4.067807547880601
3456. in the final month of the 1927 season he hit seventeen	home runs a closing spurt never matched.	5.6450837056065755
3457. always	in the abortive attacks upon ruth's record one man alone- a	jimmy foxx or a hack	wilson- made the bid.	3.194196936318128
3458. but now for the first time	since lou gehrig spurred ruth on in 1927 two men	playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60.	5.77753953980989
3459. their names are mantle	and maris their team is the yankees and their threat is real.	3.7455973989236098
3460. after 108 games in 1927 ruth had 35 home runs.	6.26678205056188
3461. after 108	games in 1961 mickey mantle has 43 roger maris 41.	4.087362562435242
3462. extend mantle's	and maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162	games and mathematically each will hit more than 60 home runs.	4.890351970363107
3463. this	is the	great edge the two yankees have going for them.	4.328337919222871
3464. to better ruth's	mark neither needs a spectacular september flourish.	6.263754114022875
3465. all mantle	needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september	and he will establish a new record.	3.804747694841164
3466. in ruth's day- and until this	year- the schedule was 154 games.	5.404967120339181
3467. baseball commissioner ford frick	has ruled that ruth's record will remain official unless it is	even on the basis of 154 games this	is the ideal situation insists hank greenberg now vice-president	of the chicago white sox.	3.1293752115178797
3468. it has to be easier with two of them.	8.472845026226862
3469. how can you walk maris to get to mantle?	5.523075408102241
3470. 	neither mantle nor maris understandably will predict 60 home runs	for himself.	5.197421675902819
3471. although both concede they would like to hit 60 they	stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote: the	important thing is to win the pennant.	3.814600324869102
3472. but one thing is for certain:	there is no dissension between mantle the american league's	most valuable player in 1956 and 1957 and maris the mvp	in 1960.	5.262891313615885
3473. each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs	and each enjoys even more seeing himself	hit home runs.	3.599279408342543
3474. the sluggers get	along so well in fact that with their families at home for the summer	they are rooming	together.	5.3798470597929215
3475. mantle maris and bob cerv a utility outfielder share	an apartment in jamaica long island not far from new york	international airport.	3.5474873310738113
3476. the three pay $251 a month for four rooms	with air-conditioning	and new modern furniture.	5.377740349747824
3477. mantle and cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom;	maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room.	3.628905123282748
3478. they	divide up the household chores: cerv does most of the cooking	mantle supplies the	transportation and maris drives	the 25-minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium.	4.974384984515887
3479. mantle maris and cerv probably share one major-league record already:	among them they have fifteen children- eight for cerv four	for mantle and three for maris.	3.3185169917110824
3480. as roommates teammates	and home-run mates mantle 29 who broke in with the yankees ten years	ago and maris 26 who came to the yankees from kansas city	two years ago have strikingly similar backgrounds.	5.046393032187553
3481. both were scholastic	stars in football basketball and baseball	; as halfbacks both came close	to playing football at the university of oklahoma	.	3.6828651770242327
3482. to an extent the two even look alike.	6.834710677281174
3483. both have blue	eyes and short blond hair.	4.781712593626676
3484. both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195	and 200 pounds but mantle incredibly muscular	looks bigger.	5.434087487563843
3485. with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders	both must have their clothes made to order.	3.966238988088662
3486. maris purchases $100	suits from simpson's in new york.	6.304832162205462
3487. mantle more concerned with	dress buys his suits four at a time at neiman-marcus in dallas and	pays as much as $250 each.	4.086248377987577
3488. neither mantle nor	maris need fear being classified an intellectual but lately mantle	has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus henry miller's	tropic of cancer.	4.893641799737419
3489. mantle so appreciated miller's delicate	literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive	passages aloud during road trips.	3.3681394247180285
3490. mantle is not normally	given to public speaking- or for that matter to private speaking.	6.363264764843103
3491. what do you and mickey talk about at home?	4.9956079771861495
3492.  a reporter asked	maris recently.	7.721065238736176
3493. to tell you the truth maris said mickey	don't talk much.	4.534724181414614
3494. this is no surprising trait for	a ballplayer.	7.560281169290191
3495. what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris	under constant pressure from writers and photographers are trying	to be cooperative.	3.5081469899570608
3496. of the two mantle is by nature the less	outgoing maris the more outspoken.	6.961198467645975
3497. but last week when a reporter	was standing near mantle's locker mickey walked up and volunteered	an anecdote.	3.691215862721039
3498. see that kid?	10.541278851432278
3499.  he said pointing to a dark-haired	11-year-old boy.	5.123220019687905
3500. i'll never	forget one time i struck out three times dropped a fly ball and we	lost the game.	5.271157140292634
3501. i came back sitting by my locker feeling real low	and the kid walks over to me looks up and says: 'you stunk'.	3.420218029486498
3502. maris in talking to reporters tries to answer all questions	candidly and fully but on rare occasions he shuns newsmen.	5.1424324399464725
3503. when	i've made a dumb play he says i don't want to talk to	anyone.	3.961908732837275
3504. by his own confession maris is an	angry young man.	6.846805266832832
3505. benched at tulsa in 1955 he told manager dutch meyer:	i can't play for you.	3.5551794139010604
3506. send me where i can play.	7.128652807551407
3507. benched at indianapolis in 1956	he told manager kerby farrell: i'm not learning anything on	the bench.	3.3332711288258494
3508. that's the way i am	he says.	7.556620782506097
3509. i tell people what i think.	4.965525987372375
3510. if you're a good ballplayer	you've got to get mad.	6.6529622074094386
3511. give me a team of nine angry men and i'll	give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of	ten times.	3.358279242284147
3512. one good indication of the two	men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes.	6.227674059915129
3513. when i was a kid maris	told a sportswriter last week i used to follow williams every day	in the box score just to see whether he got a hit or not.	3.720089902957493
3514. when you came up to the majors did you seek out williams for advice?	7.304921268306892
3515. 	are you kidding?	5.322987710180809
3516.  said maris.	11.768057010495456
3517. you're	afraid to talk to a guy you idolize.	4.601528168150852
3518. mantle's hero was joe	dimaggio.	7.330005494160748
3519. when mickey went to the yankees says mark freeman	an ex-yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver dimaggio	still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker	just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man this	hero of his.	3.2353380322945
3520. but dimaggio never said a word.	7.183041355495003
3521. he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star this	never would be said of him.	4.501669346331265
3522. mantle has kept the vow.	8.797373209444995
3523. among all	the yankees he is the veteran most friendly to rookies.	4.768695410298867
3524. neither	mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else.	5.7418326230362045
3525. if laying ties on a railroad track which he once did for $1 an hour	paid more than playing right field for the yankees maris would	lay ties on a railroad track.	3.433038303925781
3526. if working in a zinc mine which he once	did for 87-12 cents an hour paid more than playing center field for	the yankees mantle would work in a zinc mine.	5.311802220708278
3527. but since railroading	and mining are not the highest paid arts mantle and maris concentrate	on baseball.	4.263604085590682
3528. they try to play baseball the best they can.	6.691724443264583
3529. each is a complete ballplayer.	6.0741644634176275
3530. mantle beyond any question can	do more things well.	6.684569187485672
3531. says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men is that both	hitting	mantle	has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed	maris only left-handed.	3.456197199646365
3532. they both possess near classic	stances	dug in firmly arms high set for fierce swings.	5.435434591477106
3533. mantle is considerably	better hitting for average	.	5.1204969542339835
3534. both are good bunters: maris	once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues; mantle	is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base.	4.837401392376453
3535. both have brilliant	speed: mantle was timed from home plate to	first base in 3.	3.8846125407988366
3536. 1 seconds faster than any other major leaguer; maris	ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a	race against luis aparicio the swift base-stealing shortstop of the	white sox.	5.021818876626174
3537. both are good daring fielders: mantle covers more	ground; maris's throwing arm is stronger.	3.7398539363711145
3538. yet with all their	skills the appeal of mantle and maris in 1961 comes down to one	basic: the home run.	5.619530190321778
3539. with this ultimate weapon the two yankees	may have saved baseball from its dullest season.	3.9004166357182988
3540. only two teams in each league	the yankees and detroit the dodgers and cincinnati are battling	for first place.	5.464993532065863
3541. appropriately the emphasis on the home	run at a peak this year came into being at baseball's lowest moment.	3.7395380203269313
3542. in 1920 as the startling news that the 1919 white sox had conspired	to lose the world series leaked out fans grew disillusioned	and disinterested in baseball.	5.038026502172055
3543. something was needed to revive interest;	the something was the home run.	4.291631909448969
3544. into washington on president-elect john f kennedy's	convair the caroline winged actor-crooner	and his close hollywood pal cinemactor peter lawford jack	kennedy's brother-in-law.	4.572239494111056
3545. also included in the entourage: a dog	in a black sweater frankie and peter had an urgent mission: to stage	a mammoth inauguration eve entertainment gala in the capital's	national guard armory.	3.125290532043986
3546. frankie was fairly glutted with ideas as	he had hinted upon his arrival: it's really tremendous when you	think ella fitzgerald is coming from australia.	4.466473964223597
3547. i could talk to	you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans!	as the plans were laid some several thousand fat cats were to	be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced	at $10000 each.	3.3367567832723704
3548. the biggest single act would doubtless be staged	by frankie himself: his inaugural wardrobe had been designed by	hollywood couturier don loper who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles.	4.185491610112798
3549. soon after loper leaked the news that frankie had ordered	two of everything just in case he spills anything frankie	got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch	of loper clothing.	3.2735960553616645
3550. a year after he was catapulted over	nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the marine corps	general delivered a peppery annual report	in the form of a happy warless new year greeting to his	pentagon staff.	5.103631635346401
3551. said leatherneck shoup: a year ago i took the	grips of the plow in my hands.	4.064002062618499
3552. after pushing an accumulation of vines	and weeds from the moldboard i lifted the lines from the dust and	found hitched to that plow the finest team i ever held a rein on.	4.753899088266653

3576. g david thompson is one of those names known to the stewards	of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in europe's best hotels	but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town	of pittsburgh.	5.352604712687024
3577. there the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth a	reputation for eccentricity and an ardor for collecting art.	3.6852910582482328
3578. last week	in the german city of du^sseldorf g david thompson was	making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause.	5.441418602242762
3579. on display were	343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection-	and every single one of them was up for sale.	3.8462500955739727
3580. like philadelphia's	late dr albert c barnes who kept his own great collection	closed to the general public thompson	at 61 is something of a legend in his own lifetime.	5.863862351739623
3581. he made his	fortune during world war 2 when he took over a number of dying	steel plants and kept them alive until the boom.	4.034026807738022
3582. even before he hit	big money he had begun buying modern paintings.	6.452322761198871
3583. he gave the impression	of never having read a word about art but there was no doubt that	he had an eye for the best.	3.86352507103053
3584. he was able to smell a bargain-	and a masterpiece- a continent away and the museum of modern art's	alfred barr said of him: i have never mentioned a new artist	that thompson didn't know about.	5.045568919545818
3585. he might barge into a gallery	start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting.	4.034155654228137
3586. he could be lavishly generous with friends cab drivers and bellboys	but with dealers he was tough.	5.733174387915544
3587. he bought up cezannes braques matisses	legers a splendid picasso series more than 70 giacometti	sculptures.	3.5038624450416127
3588. he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees	in the world.	6.49289451355495
3589. all these he hung in his burglarproof home called stone's	throw outside pittsburgh and only people he liked and trusted	ever got to see them.	3.5169872866053296
3590. two years ago thompson offered his	collection to the city.	7.642446512259296
3591. but he insisted that it be housed in a special	museum.	4.824762169904139
3592. pittsburgh turned him down just as pittsburgh society had	been snubbing him for years.	5.483170720327499
3593. he went then to a 40-year-old basel art	dealer named ernst beyeler with whom he had long been trading pictures.	3.789418301705329
3594. last year beyeler arranged to sell $1500000 worth of klees	to the state of north rhine-westphalia which will house them in	a museum that is yet to be built.	5.3494575035750325
3595. last week most of the other prizes	once offered to pittsburgh went on the block.	5.142055289032396
3596. at the opening	of the du^sseldorf show thompson himself scarcely glanced at the	treasures that he was seeing together for the last time.	5.875913238867211
3597. in fact he	seemed delighted to get rid of them.	4.955717470306828
3598. some observers speculated that	this might be his revenge on his home town.	5.758252745931274
3599. thompson himself said:	i want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new	pictures.	3.691168186436148
3600. the university of georgia has long claimed that	it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis	of race or color.	5.226274874620808
3601. but in all its 175 years not a single negro	student has entered its classrooms.	4.3693514490120915
3602. last week federal district judge	william a bootle ordered the university to admit immediately	a qualified negro boy and girl.	5.487767608316135
3603. their entry will crack the	total segregation of all public education from kindergarten through graduate	school in georgia- and in alabama mississippi and south	carolina as well.	3.1893857803860732
3604. for 18 months hamilton holmes 19 and	charlayne hunter 18 had tried to get into the university.	5.917789049555483
3605. they graduated	together from atlanta's turner high school where valedictorian	holmes was first in the class and charlayne third.	4.062669170213178
3606. the university	rejected them on a variety of pretexts but was careful never	to mention the color of their skins.	5.367633863327643
3607. holmes went to atlanta's morehouse	college where he is a b+ student and star halfback.	4.1541899646302
3608. charlayne studied journalism at detroit's wayne state university.	5.765132785194851
3609. last fall after they took their hopes for entering georgia to	court judge bootle ordered them to apply again.	3.8475887045230888
3610. charlayne	was tentatively admitted for next fall after state investigators	questioned her white roommate at wayne state.	4.861835807747272
3611. but holmes was rejected	again on the basis of his record and interview.	4.446987003857001
3612. the evidence	in court was testimony about the interview which for holmes lasted	an hour although at least one white student at georgia got through	this ritual by a simple phone conversation.	4.641168529435561
3613. holmes was asked if he	had ever visited a house of prostitution or a beatnik parlor or teahouse.	3.593220714829424
3614. no said he but officials still called him evasive.	6.619936280424105
3615. they also said he lied in saying that he had never been arrested.	5.134830611757373
3616. their reason: holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine had his license	suspended.	5.522806075376464
3617. negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white	students found that many were hardly interviewed at all- and few	had academic records as good as hamilton holmes.	3.2729289359511036
3618. the real reason	for his rejection they argued is the fact that georgia law automatically	cuts off funds for any desegregated school.	5.161858259549979
3619. judge bootle's	decision: the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission	to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been	for their race and color.	3.428532250224963
3620. the state will appeal- but few think	it will actually try to close the university.	5.445389616253703
3621. surprised and pleased	students holmes and hunter may enter the university of georgia	this week.	3.9826231584411658
3622. when the university of	chicago's chancellor lawrence a kimpton	submitted his resignation last march a mighty talent hunt	gripped the midway.	5.137682569258586
3623. out went letters to 60000 old grads asking for	suggestions.	4.378818827731145
3624. such academic statesmen as james b conant were consulted.	6.536869156716446
3625. two committees pondered 375 possible kimpton successors including	adlai stevenson richard nixon and harvard's dean mcgeorge	bundy.	3.453306758524535
3626. the debate led to a decision that chicago needed neither	a big name nor an experienced academic administrator but rather	as trustee chairman glen a lloyd put it a top scholar in	his own right- a bright light to lure other top scholars to chicago.	4.3664692023847325
3627. last week chicago happily found its top scholar in caltech's	acting dean of the faculty: dynamic geneticist george wells	beadle 57 who shared the 1958 nobel prize in medicine and physiology	for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell	chemistry.	3.1025875008418504
3628. it fell to chancellor	kimpton now a standard oil executive to spend	his nine-year reign tidying up chicago after the 21-year typhoon of	idealist robert maynard hutchins.	4.690825721878182
3629. he threw out some of hutchins'	more wildly experimental courses raised sagging undergraduate enrollment	to 2100 nearly doubled endowment to $139.	3.338856172351334
3630. but though	kimpton put chicago in what he felt was working order some old grads	feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it	in the heady hutchins era.	5.011376042433243
3631. at caltech geneticist beadle	has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology	division since 1946.	3.8939498085421054
3632. but he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot	recruit and excite able researchers and has developed unexpected	talents in fund raising and speech-making.	5.421498322673347
3633. beadle is even that rare	scientist	who takes an interest in money matters; he avidly reads the	wall street journal and took delight in driving a $250 model a	ford for 22 years then selling it for $300.	3.003284565773554
3634. a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began	with the old adam and consequently will never end.	5.769127693273447
3635. but a historian	might put his finger on a specific man and date and hold out the hope	that the troubles will sometime pass away.	3.478421493628893
3636. the man was king leopold	2 of the belgians who in 1885 concluded that he had better	grab a colony while the grabbing was still good.	5.359347290183874
3637. by force he took under	his protection or stole 900000 square miles of wilderness in central	africa.	3.7668414422848473
3638. this is an area nearly as large as western europe;	and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political	or historical unity.	5.453337495984751
3639. its boundaries had nothing to do with geography	or ethnic groupings; they were determined by the points at which leopold's	explorers and gunmen got tired of walking.	3.656731958976279
3640. the population	of the congo is 13.	5.998891541681275
3641. 5 million divided into at least seven major	culture clusters and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate	dialects.	3.825488566073834
3642. the religions of the people include christianity mohammedanism	paganism ancestor worship and animism.	5.467796984414707
3643. the climate ranges from	the steamily equatorial to the temperate.	3.3401504406627427
3644. the hospitals contain patients	trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars.	4.8290278888514635
3645. to make one	nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any	case; it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have	done or failed to do in the congo since 1885.	4.296020082969141
3646. at first the	belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property.	6.736833046615968
3647. but by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience.	4.224920643220446
3648. the belgian government itself took over administration commencing	a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism.	5.24198095822323
3649. one definition of paternalism is the principle or practice	on the part of a government of managing the affairs of a country in	the manner of a father dealing with his children.	3.939870267653991
3650. the honor of the	belgians in this matter is not to be questioned- only their judgment.	6.0560677985857145
3651. ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time-	but when the colony received independence in 1960 the congolese child	if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 was 52 and had until	then been treated as an infant.	3.2806425013210183
3652. the belgians were interested	primarily in the economic development of the congo which is rich in	copper tin cobalt manganese zinc and uranium and cotton and palm	oil.	5.030654820435591
3653. the colony was administered from brussels with neither the	congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote.	3.0489958738305813
3654. the beneficiaries	of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both	individuals and the belgian government itself held stock.	5.009806314617073
3655. in inside	africa john gunther describes one of these the societe generale	as the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if let us	say the house of morgan anaconda copper the mutual life insurance	company of new york the pennsylvania railroad and various	companies producing agricultural products were lumped together with	the united states government as a heavy partner.	3.2525909580686623
3656. had	they been truly ruthless the belgians might have exploited the congolese	without compassion.	5.274519746183004
3657. they provided a social	security system which covered all their african employes; their program	of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent;	they put much effort into public housing.	3.074291491955363
3658. they also instituted a ration	system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish	their employes with clothing and adequate food.	5.366014049173978
3659. but instead of	delivering the ration- either in actual commodities or in cash- at	intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month the belgians felt obliged	to dole it out more often.	3.239899121767313
3660. would not the children if they received all	their food on the first day of the month eat it up immediately and	later go hungry?	6.447531897267824
3661.    the belgians also placed great emphasis	on education.	3.9321554886884935
3662. during the 1950s there were as many as 25000 schools in	the congo.	7.149265961744973
3663. but almost all the schools were primary.	5.888401520131937
3664. the average congolese	can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of la chatte	and le chien and write his name.	5.343928404210964
3665. some schools were	technical- the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit	the land and trained many.	3.565551249550374
3666. but they did not believe in widespread	secondary education much less in college.	6.958327449638677
3667. it was their conviction	that the people should be brought up together a grade at a time	until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history	economics and political science.	3.3539029873462884
3668. indeed the belgians discouraged	higher education fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite	which might cause unrest.	5.819357839009633
3669. when the congo received its independence	in 1960 there were among its 13.	4.185328055191265
3670. 5 million people exactly 14 university	graduates.	8.11099492670914
3671. why did the belgians grant independence to a	colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it?	4.074984509689693
3672.  in one large oversimplification	it might be said that the belgians felt far too late the	gale of nationalism sweeping africa.	6.521231505900641
3673. they lacked time to prepare	the congo as the british and french had prepared their colonies.	3.9986937711056676
3674. the	congolese were clamoring for their independence even though most	were unsure what it meant; and in brussels street crowds shouted	pas une goutte de sang!.	4.515083557354538
3675. the	belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue;	rather than teach where teaching was not wanted they would	wash their hands of the mess.	3.6011753521633842
3676. it is hard to blame them for this.	7.577774810276672
3677. yet	there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after	independence for which history may not find them guiltless.	3.4206137039730877
3678. as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no	fewer than 120 political parties or approximately eight for each university	graduate.	6.154977977092305
3679. there were four principal ones.	5.862521932585801
3680. first there were those	congolese who favored splitting the	country into small independent states balkanizing it.	5.548065268354204
3681. second there	were those who favored near-balkanization a loose	federalism having a central government of limited authority with	much power residing in the states.	3.391338129790211
3682. third there were those	who favored a unified congo with a very strong central	government.	5.89369846263111
3683. and fourth there were moderates who were in no hurry	for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up.	3.7465183898303454
3684. however	the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting.	5.972711342770394
3685. a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation	of the congo immediately after independence was the provincial structure	that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration.	3.365570840425795
3686. they had divided the congo into six provinces- leopoldville	kasai kivu katanga equator and eastern- unfortunately	with little regard for ethnic groupings.	4.966119779950736
3687. thus some provinces contained	tribes which detested each other and to them independence meant	an opportunity for war.	4.023477598877036
3688. the belgian congo was granted its independence	with what seemed a workable western-style form of government:	there were to be a president and a premier and a bicameral legislature	elected by universal suffrage in the provinces.	4.807387789600976
3689. well-wishers	around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable	position in the society of nations.	3.5977567500621235
3690. if internal frictions arose	they could be handled by the 25000-man congolese army the force	publique which had been trained and was still officered by white	belgians.	5.387530399632856
3691. the president joseph kasavubu seemed an able administrator	and the premier patrice lumumba a reasonable man.	3.4815778329616967
3692. twenty-four	hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting	each other.	5.588200006240153
3693. presently the well-armed members of the force publique-	many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes	erupted in mutiny rioting raping and looting.	3.5628467548286804
3694. terror engulfed the thousands	of belgian civilians who had remained in the country.	5.765966749660369
3695. the belgian	government decided to act and on july 10 dispatched paratroops	to the congo.	3.4311419578367874
3696. on july 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of	katanga moise tshombe announced that his province had seceded from	the country.	5.72110800066997
3697. confusion became chaos; each succeeding day brought	new acts of violence.	3.6295963545556917
3698. lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military	intervention by the belgians and appealed to the united nations	to send troops to oust them.	5.601990781955243
3699. on july 14 the security	council-	with france and great britain abstaining- voted the resolution	which drew the un into the congo.	3.650930941433341
3700. vague in wording it	called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the secretary-general	to take the necessary steps h to provide the congolese	government with such military assistance as may be necessary until	through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical	assistance of the united nations the national security forces	may be able in the opinion of the government to meet fully their tasks	h.	5.055100495701383
3701. secretary-general hammarskjo^ld decided that it	would be preferable if the un troops sent into the congo were	to come from african or at least nonwhite nations- certainly not	from the us	russia great britain or france.	3.2127794378614802
3702. he quickly	called on ghana tunisia morocco guinea and mali which dispatched	troops within hours.	4.945561363876001
3703. ultimately the un army in the congo	reached a top strength of 19000 including about 5000 from india	and a few soldiers from eire and sweden who were the only whites.	3.365256943193244
3704. it took the un three months to bring a modest form of	order to the congo.	6.689672102470369
3705. the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops	and often obstructed un efforts.	3.3859108132888283
3706. the wildly erratic nature	of patrice lumumba caused constant problems- he frequently announced	that he wanted the un to get out of the congo along with	the belgians and appealed to russia for help.	5.17833478441419
3707. little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist.	4.282434963145957
3708. before appealing	to the un or to russia he first appealed to the us	lumumba further complicated	the un's mission by initiating small wars with the	secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which under	albert kalonji wanted to secede as well.	4.599796953066191
3709. meanwhile russia took every	opportunity to meddle in the congo sending lumumba equipment for	his wars dispatching technicians and even threatening	on occasion to intervene openly.	3.355940297526206
3710. but by the end of the three-month	period in october 1960 something approaching calm settled on	the congo.	6.468952206119079
3711. president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and	fired him.	4.418859549011549
3712. control of the government- such	control as there was and such government as there was- passed into	the hands of joseph mobutu chief of staff of the congolese army.	5.422179860080213
3713. mobutu promptly flung out the russians who have not since played any	significant part on the local scene although they have redoubled their	obstructionist efforts at un headquarters in new york.	3.4830927325311087
3714. the belgians- at least officially- departed from the congo as well	withdrawing all of their uniformed troops.	5.2379016050904275
3715. but they left behind	them large numbers of officers variously called volunteers or	mercenaries who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga	the seceded province which according to tshombe holds 65% of	the mineral wealth of the entire country.	3.2729408624169665
3716. from october 1960	to february 1961 the un forces in the congo took little action.	6.527815214611411
3717. there was no directive for it- the security council's resolution	had not mentioned political matters and in any case the united	nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political	affairs of any nation whether to unify it federalize it or balkanize	it.	3.373753380354869
3718. during the five-month lull civil war smoldered and	flickered throughout the congo.	6.058574310215048
3719. in february the murder of patrice	lumumba who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of	tshombe again stirred the un to action.	3.5753887387605654
3720. on feb 21 the	council passed another resolution urging the taking of all appropriate	measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo including	h the use of force if necessary in the last resort.	5.983637456242744
3721. although	the resolution might have been far more specific it was considerably	tougher than the earlier one.	4.079417051398601
3722. it also urged that the un	eject and prevent the return of all belgian and other foreign military	and political advisers; ordered an investigation of lumumba's	death; urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the	reorganization of the army.	5.0079135764736264
3723. though president john	f kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin	and disarmament adviser mccloy's unexpected report from khrushchev	his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved	him in other key problems of us foreign policy last week.	3.182788535584238
3724. high up on the president's priority list was the thorny question	of bizerte.	6.358945105496015
3725. on this issue the president received a detailed	report from his un ambassador adlai stevenson who had just	returned from paris and mr kennedy asked stevenson to search	for a face-saving	way- for both paris and tunis- out of the imbroglio.	3.443996351902673
3726. ideally the president would like the french to agree on a status	quo ante on bizerte and accept a new timetable for withdrawing	their forces from the mediterranean base.	5.181344694511297
3727. to continue their important	conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of	other problems mr kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for	the weekend.	3.5773230144001946
3728. the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with	the no 2 man in the tunisian government defense minister bahi	ladgham who flew to washington last week to seek us support.	4.982085842106419
3729. the conversation apparently convinced mr kennedy that the	positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable.	3.3486765600054573
3730. through ladgham	mr kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian	president habib bourguiba; and one us official said: the	key question now is which side picks up the phone first.	4.704950970989739
3731. on the latin american front the president held talks with secretary	of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay	and the inter-american economic and social council	.	3.406589024413558
3732. main purpose of the	meeting: to discuss president kennedy's alliance for progress.	5.4903263419925254
3733. and that was not all.	7.17081871283454
3734. in conferences with nationalist china's	dapper diminutive vice president chen cheng mr kennedy	assured chiang kai-shek's emissary that the us is as	firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united	nations.	4.840609931701322
3735. chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission	of outer mongolia; however the president who would like to woo	the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow would	promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the us if outer	mongolia's admission comes to a vote.	3.2671934870970216
3736. the president	also conferred with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seeking	more foreign aid.	4.443469869759476
3737. to africa he sent his most trusted adviser	his brother attorney general robert kennedy on a good-will mission	to the ivory coast.	3.45671152803495
3738. all week long the president clearly was playing	a larger personal role in foreign affairs; in effect he was practicing	what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he	declared:	we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems	with any and all nations that are willing to talk and listen with	reason.	4.846741644941215
3739. from international airport	in los angeles to international airport in houston as the	great four-jet boeing 707 flies is a routine five hours and 25 minutes	including stopovers at phoenix el paso and san antonio.	3.1052071218527293
3740. when	continental airlines night-coach flight 54 took off at 11:30 one	night last week there was no reason to think it would take any longer.	5.873697537585812
3741. the plane put down on schedule at 1:35 am in phoenix.	3.6362436214714062
3742. thirty-one minutes later when it took off for el paso hardly	anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention	to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard.	5.18046947792864
3743. at 3:58 am	with the plane about twenty minutes out of el paso passenger robert	berry a san antonio advertising man glanced up and saw the	man and boy accompanied by a stewardess walking up the aisle toward	the cockpit.	3.1898725550799325
3744. the man was bent over with his hand on his stomach	berry said.	6.238034874526929
3745. i figured he was sick.	5.330287943186164
3746. john salvador a	farmer from palm desert calif was sitting up front and could	see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit.	4.991417462485773
3747. the kid had	a .	4.103849819431497
3748. 45 automatic like they issue in the army he said.	6.941842000162236
3749. the other	fellow had a .	3.9407558137308354
3750. salvador saw the youth hold his .	6.456860011386759
3751. 45 against the	head of stewardess lois carnegey; the man put his .	3.8136887020471133
3752. 38 at the head	of capt byron d rickards.	6.3985661420774775
3753. to rickards a 52-year-old	veteran 30 years in the air it was an old story: his plane was	being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 when	peruvian rebels made him land a ford tri-motor at arequipa.	3.4726967235947654
3754. but	last week's pirates like the cuban-american who recently hijacked	an eastern airlines electra wanted to	go to havana.	4.695450729689169
3755. tell your company there are four	of us here	with guns the elder man told rickards.	3.5062618130356817
3756. the pilot radioed	el paso international airport with just that message.	5.119285896763238
3757. but he	told the skyjackers the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach	havana; they would have to refuel at el paso.	3.4702389931198323
3758. most passengers	didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground.	6.674420420638734
3759. jerry mccauley of sacramento calif one of some twenty air force	recruits on board awoke from a nap in confusion.	3.277534384120748
3760. the old man	came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers	to go to cuba mccauley said and like a nut i raised my hand.	5.243254686639559
3761. i thought he was the air force recruiter.	6.529837221777667
3762. what the man	wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages along with the crew.	6.211380351064013
3763. they chose four: jack casey who works for continental airlines	in houston; fred mullen from mercer island wash;	pfc	truman cleveland of st augustine.	3.1084820159454276
3764. fla and leonard gilman	a former college boxer and veteran of the us immigration	service border patrol.	5.58243817720491
3765. everybody else was allowed to file off the	plane after it touched down at el paso at 4:18 am.	3.577112514975859
3766. they found a large welcoming group- el paso policemen border patrol	sheriff's deputies and fbi men who surged around the	plane with rifles and submarine guns.	4.815461892344156
3767. other fbi men talking with	the pilot from the tower conspired with him to delay the proposed	flight to havana.	3.6441399402400134
3768. the ground crew which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty	minutes took fully three hours.	4.539499667580758
3769. still more time was consumed while	the pilot at the radioed suggestion of continental president robert	six tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the boeing jet for	a propeller-driven douglas dc-7.	3.2459287464234365
3770. actually the officers	on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with	any kind of an airplane; they had orders to that effect straight	from president kennedy who thought at first as did most others that	it was four followers of cuba's fidel castro who had taken over	the 707.	4.626506825437976
3771. mr kennedy had been informed early in the day of the	attempt to steal the plane kept in touch throughout by telephone.	4.16328314008764
3772. at	one time while still under the impression that he was dealing with a	cuban plot the president talked about invoking a total embargo on	trade with cuba.	5.493493851491378
3773. as the morning wore on and a blazing west texas	sun wiped the shadows off the franklin mountains police got close	enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment.	3.3679149388083323
3774. from the	luggage they learned that the two air pirates far from being cubans	were native americans subsequently identified as leon bearden	50-year-old ex-convict from coolidge ariz and his son cody	16 a high-school junior.	4.875714741149944
3775. the heat and strain began	to tell on the beardens.	3.558732019186993
3776. the father by accident or perhaps to show	as he said we mean business took the .	5.065966455210544
3777. 45 and fired a slug	between the legs of second officer norman simmons.	3.8305836259474644
3778. at 7:30 am	more than three hours after landing the beardens gave an ultimatum:	take off or see the hostages killed.	5.210703737592478
3779. the tower	cleared the plane for take-off at 8 am and captain rickards	began taxiing toward the runway.	3.183934060761864
3780. several police cars loaded with	armed officers raced alongside blazing away at the tires of the	big jet.	5.284484995125087
3781. the slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard	engines; the plane slowed to a halt.	3.4097725152802996
3782. ambulances baggage trucks	and cars surrounded it.	6.1719750236355475
3783. at 12:50 pm	a ramp was rolled up to the plane.	4.833729436637724
3784. a few minutes later fbi agent	francis crosby talking fast eased up the ramp to the plane unarmed.	5.936197085622891
3785. while crosby distracted the beardens stewardesses carnegey	and toni besset dropped out of a rear door.	3.911237107234397
3786. so did hostages casey	cleveland and mullen.	7.377856780577264
3787. that left only the four crew members crosby	and border patrolman gilman all unarmed with the beardens.	3.689840608524916
3788. the elder bearden had one pistol in his hand the other in a hip pocket.	5.3878220667965495
3789. gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance.	4.2400975858347545
3790. he caught	officer simmons' eye nodded toward young bearden and- i	swung my right as hard as i could.	5.035940065433639
3791. simmons and crosby jumped the boy	and it was all over.	3.8244822204987945
3792. frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48	pm the beardens were held in bail of $100000 each on charges	of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines.	4.5641917851521665
3793. back home in coolidge ariz his 36-year-old wife	mary said: i thought they were going to phoenix to look for	jobs.	3.7525154851691256
3794. taking precedence over all other	legislation on	capitol hill last week was the military strength of	the nation.	5.720739644126111
3795. the senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed	speed and unanimity to pass- 85 to 0- the largest peacetime	defense budget in us history.	3.0653995325556807
3796. with the money all	but in hand however the administration indicated that instead of	the 225000 more men in uniform that president kennedy had requested	the armed forces would be increased by only 160000.	5.1225106580707385
3797. the hold-back	as pentagon mutterers labeled it apparently was a temporary	expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually	and thus the new funds spent prudently.	2.9842740962175225
3798. in all the senate	signed a check for $46.	7.557999082150993
3799. 7 billion which not only included the extra	$3.	4.637953211853351
3800. 5 billion requested the week before by president kennedy but	tacked on $754 million more than the president had asked for.	6.169772487216754
3801. senate on its own decided to provide additional b-52 and other	the house which	had passed its smaller appropriation before the president's urgent	call for more was expected to go along with the increased defense	budget in short order.	3.2881037847466366
3802. in other areas congressional action last	week included:    the senate and the house	passed and sent to the white house the compromise	farm bill which the president is expected to sign not too unhappily.	6.0271076824368
3803. the senate also voted $5.	4.478891835732545
3804. 2 billion to finance the government's	health welfare and labor activities.	6.463725155991641
3805. debate on the	all-important foreign-aid	bill with its controversial long-range proposals	had just begun on the senate floor at the weekend.	3.396205307042793
3806. white house	legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact.	5.908523790689088
3807. most members of the us senate	because they are human like to eat as high on the hog as they	can.	4.45518350151608
3808. but because they are politicians they like to talk as poor-mouth	as the lowliest voter.	6.495164906179173
3809. as a result ever since 1851 when the senate	restaurant opened in the new wing of the capitol building the senators	have never ceased to grumble about the food- even while they	opposed every move that might improve it.	3.6208298048882814
3810. over the years enlivened	chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of maine and idaho	potatoes the menu has pursued its drab all-american course.	5.320575854854381
3811. individual	senators with an eye to the voters back home occasionally introduced	smelts from michigan soft-shell crabs from maryland oysters	from washington grapefruit from florida.	3.1948118931157077
3812. but plain old bean soup	served daily	since the turn of the century	made clear to the citizenry that	the senate's stomach was in the right place.	5.590709315621751
3813. in a daring	stroke the senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute	cuisine and hired a $10000-per-year french-born maitre d'hotel.	3.8645933559596415
3814. holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly	reports on operation of the turnpikes.	5.693149215720499
3815. long-term trend	of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward.	3.8707985264657148
3816. higher toll rates	also are helping boost revenues.	6.551483100818466
3817. result is a better prospect	for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative.	3.8922445944286514
3818. things are looking up these days for many of the	state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road	bonds.	5.568137675724315
3819. traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing.	4.857515099403932
3820. that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll	gates.	5.722531041478626
3821. as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes investors	who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright	speculations are now finding new hope for their investments.	3.7058547720405786
3822. another	result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these	tax-exempt bonds.	5.279648580791858
3823. other tax-exempt bonds of state and local	governments hit a price peak on february 21 according to standard	+ poor's average.	3.532210131465898
3824. on balance prices of those bonds have slipped	a bit since then.	6.134329236385415
3825. however in the same three-month period toll-road	bonds as a group have bucked this trend.	4.7230746658347424
3826. on these bonds price rises	since february 21 easily outnumber price declines.	6.140467568380168
3827. investors however still see an element of more-than-ordinary	risk in the toll-road bonds.	4.009751418853301
3828. you find the evidence of that in the	chart on this page.	7.059621464853048
3829. many of the toll-road bonds still are selling	at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent	or very close to that.	3.8649479157692914
3830. and this is true in the case of some turnpikes	on which revenues have risen close to or beyond the point at which	the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on	the bonds.	5.386311302763724
3831. that 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be	had on good corporation bonds.	4.078780946755065
3832. it's not much more in fact than	the return that is offered on u s treasury bonds.	5.728550210791997
3833. for	investors whose income is taxed at high rates though a tax-free yield	of 4 per cent is high.	3.4615434967942917
3834. it is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried	investor with more than $16000 of income to be taxed or for	a married couple with more than $32000 of taxed income.	5.668733399773188
3835. a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the	most recent 12-month period- ending in february or march- shows	what is happening.	3.380184580291742
3836. the report is based on a survey by blyth + company	investment bankers.	5.757179804661716
3837. nearly all the turnpikes show gains in	net revenues during the period.	4.289412718228733
3838. and there is the bright note:	the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late	in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession.	6.428314795606984
3839. many	of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter.	4.091875910391929
3840. indication:	the long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward.	5.712939057060579
3841. look	for example at the ohio turnpike.	4.581504371657204
3842. traffic on that road slumped	sharply in january and february as compared with those same months	in 1960.	5.4389534595912545
3843. then march brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues-	after operating costs.	3.975757521657255
3844. as a result the road's net revenues	in the 12 months ending march 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest	payments on the turnpike bonds.	5.953856938686101
3845. that was up from 173 per cent	in the preceding 12 months.	4.360929029084108
3846. that same pattern of earnings shows	up on the massachusetts turnpike.	6.623854360315843
3847. operating revenues were off in	the first three months of 1961 but up for the 12 months ending in march.	4.249665965436363
3848. costs were held down despite a bitter winter.	6.65018903224627
3849. for the	year the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs against 121	per cent in the preceding period.	4.026316007606962
3850. the road's engineers look for further	improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston.	5.024649591801356
3851. some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough	to prove what they can do.	4.104372522954886
3852. the 187-mile illinois state toll	highway	for example was not opened over its entire length until december 1958.	4.72820468255192
3853. in the 12 months ended in february 1960 the highway earned enough	to cover 64 per cent of its interest load- with the remainder paid	out of initial reserves.	3.7420184159463767
3854. in the 12 months ended in february 1961	this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest.	6.444311312002372
3855. in the first two months of 1961 earnings of the	illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent	from early 1960.	3.849540456120528
3856. success for many turnpikes has come hard.	7.099879575301044
3857. traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates.	4.160319574915552
3858. in these cases the turnpike managements have had to turn to	toll-rate increases or to costly improvements such as extensions or	better	connections with other highways.	5.623069410948368
3859. many rate increases already	have been put into effect.	4.909216993710148
3860. higher tolls are planned for july 1	1961 on the richmond-petersburg va turnpike and proposals for	increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study.	4.789019919786986
3861. progress is being made too in improving motorists' access	to many turnpikes.	4.149950174276221
3862. the kansas turnpike offers an illustration.	6.009136990527839
3863. net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements	in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended feb 28	1961.	3.900559324604824
3864. further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike	are expected late in 1961 with the opening of a new bypass at wichita	and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in	both kansas city kans and kansas city mo.	5.2718589105789055
3865. meanwhile there	appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover	the interest deficiency for eight more years.	3.568803477122048
3866. investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find	that not all roads are nearing their goals.	5.3181591143015625
3867. traffic and revenues	on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners	and investors alike.	3.9246879624857494
3868. if nothing is done the prospect is that that	road will be in default of interest in 1962.	6.26719034103911
3869. west virginia toll bonds	have defaulted in interest for months and despite recent improvement	in revenues holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same.	3.624196374532376
3870. the typical picture at this	time is one of steady improvement.	6.37896713200901
3871. it's going to take time	for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in	full.	4.0418845787836135
3872. already however several of the turnpikes are earning enough	to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins.	5.999818758661092
3873. many others are	attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even	point.	4.574778161307246

3875. commerce secretary luther hodges	accompanied by a member of our staff on may 10 toured plants of	two of italy's biggest companies- fiat the auto producer	and olivetti maker of typewriters and calculating machines.	3.202559163469524
3876. our staff man cabled from turin as follows-   follow	secretary hodges through the fiat plant and you learn this:	one modern equipment- much of it supplied under the	marshall plan- enables fiat to turn out 2100 cars a day.	4.572696195402925
3877. about	half of these are exported.	5.55167393571392

3882. said secretary hodges: 'it's a tough	combination for the us to face'.	6.291383784294577
3883. olivetti	had a special interest for hodges.	4.643570043092807
3884. olivetti took over underwood	the us typewriter maker in late 1959.	5.543581379878722
3885. within a year without	reducing wages underwood's production costs were cut one third	prices were slashed.	3.893242469983985
3886. the result has been that exports of underwood	products have doubled.	6.202848175866864

3892. there are many places where we can use their	vigor and new ideas'.	6.5953082842673405
3893. foreign competition has	become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new	ways of handling competitive imports.	3.3824309326616198
3894. the recently unveiled	kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be	significant for american businessmen in many lines.	4.7892538006775665
3895. important	aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these:   an	international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting	countries will be called shortly by president kennedy.	3.614435996806914
3896. chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting.	6.592598794337478
3897. the us will try to get agreement among the industrialized	countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed	countries over the years.	3.370654083228824
3898. point is that developing countries	often build up a textile industry first need encouragement to	get on their feet.	5.41154755120923
3899. if they have trouble exporting international bill	for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would.	3.9529245910722524
3900. idea	is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible.	6.391110278188202
3901. at the same time another purpose of the conference	will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports-	especially dumping of specific products- to high-wage textile-producing	countries.	3.5117664548654512
3902. japan since 1957 has been voluntarily	curbing exports of textiles to the us.	5.765157266762595
3903. hong kong	india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types	of textiles to britain for several years under the lancashire pact.	3.419814332259772
3904. none of these countries is happy with these arrangements.	6.815091443870968
3905. the japanese want to increase exports to the us	while they have been curbing shipments they have watched hong kong	step in and capture an expanding share of the big us market.	3.4503989323394486

3907. the indians and pakistanis	are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for	similar reasons.	3.31194377848284
3908. the kennedy hope is that at the conference	or through bilateral talks the low-wage textile-producing countries	in asia and europe will see that dumping practices cause	friction all around and may result in import quotas.	4.807401856529701
3909. gradual	controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what president	kennedy wants.	4.041028845997616
3910. this may point the way toward international stabilization	agreements in other products.	6.487322135374322
3911. it's an important clue	to washington thinking.	4.406394915435597
3912. note too that the kennedy	textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the us	textile industry.	5.575837468188438
3913. get competitive or get out.	5.214415804154091
3914. in	veiled terms that's what the kennedy administration is saying to	the american textile industry.	5.7851724482211
3915. the government will help in	transferring companies and workers into new lines where modernization	doesn't seem feasible.	3.4258972538957977

3917. government research will look into new	products and methods.	4.308568116030119
3918. import quotas aren't ruled out	where the national interest is involved.	5.945973089529547
3919. but the kennedy administration	doesn't favor import quotas.	4.965268053163632
3920. rather they are impressed	with the british government's success in forcing- and helping-	the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to	other products.	4.892563365373551
3921. what's happening in textiles can be handwriting	on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with	imports from low-wage countries.	3.2075600522564156
3922. among the highest-paid workers	in the world are us coal miners.	6.78331012952499
3923. yet us coal is	cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water.	4.031755433734588
3924. steel	company of wales a british steelmaker wants to bring in	virginia coal cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be	able to compete more effectively- especially in foreign markets.	5.156975790045741
3925. virginia coal delivered by ship in wales will be about	$2.	4.030972830171458
3926. 80 a ton cheaper than welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines.	5.60201749258058
3927. us coal is cheap despite high wages because	of widespread mechanization of mines wide coal seams attactive rates	on ocean freight.	3.2624112660849716
3928. many of the coal seams in the nationalized british	mines are twisting narrow and very deep.	6.0947886130521916
3929. productivity	of us miners is twice that of the british.	4.611660192968956
3930. welsh	coal miners communist-led are up in arms at the suggestion that	the steel company bring in american coal.	5.250564161993045
3931. the british government will have to decide whether to let	us coal in.	4.441267316735597
3932. the british coal industry is unprofitable has large	coal stocks it can't sell.	5.053150313232177
3933. every library borrower or at least those whose taste goes	beyond the five-cent fiction rentals knows what it is to hear the librarian	say apologetically i'm sorry but we don't have that	book.	3.6746244888461326
3934. there wouldn't be much demand for it i'm afraid.	7.219929378118285
3935. behind this reply and its many variations is the ever-present budget	problem all libraries must face from the largest to the smallest.	3.359392786932345
3936. what to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15000 book titles?	6.714411997011334
3937. 	what to buy for adult and child readers for lovers of fiction and	nonfiction for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified when	your budget is pitifully small?	2.9719971463834858
3938.  most library budgets are hopelessly	inadequate.	8.062787058739556
3939. a startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually	which includes the librarian's salary and not even the new	york public has enough money to meet its needs- this in the world's	richest city.	3.227970952876704
3940. the plight of a small community library is proportionately	worse.	5.878143789348567
3941. confronted with this situation most libraries	either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they	can with what they have or else depend on the bounty of patrons and	local governments to supplement their annual funds.	3.2878521817680895
3942. in some parts of	the country however a co-operative movement has begun to grow under	the wing of state governments whereby with the financial help of the	state libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional	basis.	4.807560140352265
3943. new york state has what is probably the most advanced	of these co-operative systems so well developed that it has become	a model for others to follow.	4.037239765895441
3944. because it is so large a state with	marked contrasts in population density the organization of the new	york co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works.	6.301777977206821
3945. at	one extreme are the systems of upper new york state where libraries	in two or more counties combine to serve a large sparsely populated	area.	3.720766199506474
3946. at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library	system in a high-density area with ample resources and a rapidly	growing territory to serve.	5.161838530889704
3947. both these types and those	in between are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries	that began at albany as early as 1950 with the creation by the	legislature of county library systems financed by county governments	with matching funds from the state.	3.190814176149242
3948. it was a step in the right direction	but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully	the thriving systems of today.	5.7301838833308
3949. under this law annual grants are	given to systems in substantial amounts.	4.12191680581474
3950. an earlier difficulty was	overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might	join or not as they saw fit.	5.883642164544013
3951. some library boards are wary of the	plan.	4.436021760467523
3952. a large well-stocked library surrounded in a county by smaller	ones may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too	great.	5.678819908915611
3953. a small library may cherish its independence and established	ways and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems	radical to older members of the board.	3.3917790623258206
3954. within a system however	the autonomy of each member library is preserved.	6.633095457176494
3955. the local community	maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library	program facilities and services but wider resources and additional	services become available through membership in a system.	3.340684180137608
3956. all	services are given without cost to members.	6.434033086420165
3957. so obvious are these advantages	that nearly 95 per cent of the population of new york state	now has access to a system and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day	not too distant when all the libraries in the state will belong to	a co-op.	3.7752013565439135
3958. to set up a co-operative library system the law	requires a central book collection of 100000 nonfiction volumes as	the nucleus and the system is organized around it.	5.283591815656512
3959. the collection may	be in an existing library or it may be built up in a central collection.	3.9299808078837986
3960. each system develops differently according to the area it serves	but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for	maximum efficiency.	5.578628336076771
3961. the basic state grant is thirty cents for each	person served and there is a further book incentive grant that provides	an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita if a library spends	a certain number of dollars.	3.2892696531393346
3962. in nassau county for example	the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city the	system is credited by the state with serving one million persons a figure	that has doubled since 1950.	5.414854553938586
3963. this system by virtue of its variety	and size offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation.	4.129871151932454
3964. the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference	service what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge	and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area.	4.711950538163807
3965. the	need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual	libraries adequate to satisfy everyday needs could afford.	3.4405158847208415
3966. nassau	is currently building a central collection of reference materials	in its hempstead headquarters which will reach its goal of 100000	volumes by 1965.	4.974728890968423
3967. the major part of this collection is in the	central headquarters building and the remainder is divided among five	libraries in the system designated as subject centers.	3.4673794903592428
3968. basic	reference	tools are the backbone of the collection but there is also specialization	in science and technology an indicated weakness in local libraries.	5.550211327962029
3969. on microfilm headquarters also has a file of the new york	times from its founding in 1851 to the present day as well as bound	volumes of important periodicals.	4.340301328181598
3970. the entire headquarters collection	is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans.	5.506657353699765
3971. headquarters gets about 100 requests every day.	4.609962310809677
3972. it is connected	by teletype with the state library in albany which will supply any	book to a system that the system itself cannot provide.	5.52838064307598
3973. the books are	carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other	libraries.	3.2296508248188736
3974. each subject center library was chosen because	of its demonstrated strength in a particular area which headquarters	could then build upon.	5.256326314363686
3975. east meadow has philosophy psychology and	religion; freeport houses social science pure science and language;	history biography and education are centered in hempstead; levittown	has applied science business and literature; while hewlett-woodmere	is the repository of art music and foreign languages.	2.911740599057682
3976. the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant	and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen	local reference service.	5.010484419525504
3977. this kind of cooperation is not	wholly new of course.	4.25749349937222
3978. public libraries in nassau county have been	lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century but the system	enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive	basis.	5.17122678831111
3979. local libraries find too that the new plan saves	tax dollars because books can be bought through the system and since	the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would	be available to an individual library.	3.5387928729830618
3980. the system passes on these	savings to its members.	5.828580722304194
3981. further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping	and clerical detail as the result of central billing.	4.07427645043903
3982. books are not the only resource of the system.	7.894964849503845
3983. schools and community	groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary art	and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs	and to organizations in member communities.	3.1844929942728304
3984. the most recent film	catalogue available at each library lists 110 titles presently in the	collection any of which may be borrowed without charge.	5.070996536250242
3985. this catalogue	lists separately films suitable for children young adults or adults	although some classics cut across age groups such as nanook	of the north the emperor's nightingale and the	red balloon.	3.0877879843586684
3986. workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual	consultant for the staffs of member libraries teaching them the effective	use of film as a library service.	5.011041804843179
3987. the system well understands	that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children	and books together; consequently an experienced children's librarian	at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned	library activities cooperating with the children's librarians	in member libraries by means of individual conferences workshops	and frequent visits.	2.991888275899969
3988. headquarters has also set up a central juvenile	book-review and book-selection center to provide better methods of	purchasing and selection.	5.613802357853674
3989. sample copies of new books are on display	at headquarters where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in	workshop groups.	3.3171313228334713
3990. story hours pre-school programs activities with	community agencies and lists of recommended reading are all in the province	of the children's consultant.	4.932395777664715
3991. headquarters of the nassau	system is an increasingly busy place these days threatening to expand	beyond its boundaries.	3.6433912639792583
3992. in addition to the interlibrary loan service	and the children's program headquarters has a public relations	director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library	service in the county; it prepares cooperative displays	for use in member	libraries; it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays	already created and used; and it publishes sum and substance	a monthly newsletter which reports the system's activities to	the staffs and trustees of member libraries.	4.232752117119926
3993. the system itself is governed	by a board of trustees geographically representing its membership.	3.975565061480377
3994. in nassau as in other systems the long-range objective	is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools and	on adult education in general.	5.551045693298669
3995. librarians a patient breed of men	and women who have borne much with dedication can begin to see results	today.	3.4755004015704705
3996. library use is multiplying daily and the bulk of the newcomers	are those maligned americans the teen-agers.	5.240713000874578
3997. to them especially	the librarians with the help of co-ops hope they will never have to	say i'm sorry we don't have that book.	3.7205911408027204
3998. today more than ever before the survival of our free society	depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned.	5.919330535599586
3999. the	great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our	own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western	world.	3.7413111047881977
4000. the need for lifetime reading is apparent.	6.375266820833329
4001. education must not	be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our	entire lives for it is only through knowledge that we as a nation	can cope with the dangers that threaten our society.	3.6259630819055544
4002. the desire	and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life.	5.238234266690883
4003. we	cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read; if we are not	discriminating in our reading; if we do not know how to use what we	do read.	4.069026120185363
4004. we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific	age as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint	that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom	absorbed from the written word.	5.924431251269378
4005. a fundamental source of knowledge	in the world today is the book found in our libraries.	3.9634995133364277
4006. although	progress has been made in america's system of libraries it still	falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that	are needed for an informed america.	5.715013195463026
4007. the problem grows in intensity	each year as man's knowledge and his capacity to translate such knowledge	to the written word continue to expand.	3.244276059429671
4008. the inadequacy of our	library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct	this condition.	4.7015746041782505
4009. there are for example approximately 25000000	people in this country with no public library service and about 50000000	with inadequate service.	4.001176244298226
4010. in college libraries 57 per cent of the	total number of books are owned by 124 of 1509 institutions surveyed	last year by the us office of education.	5.3344877315369725
4011. and over 66 per	cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any	library at all.	3.7714710174645187
4012. in every aspect of service- to the public	to children in schools to colleges and universities- the library	of today is failing to render vitally needed services.	4.82272624440577
4013. only public	understanding and support can provide that service.	4.605751634658741
4014. this is	one of the main reasons for national library week april 16-22 and	for its theme: for a richer fuller life read!	the general assembly which	adjourns today has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle	from the day it convened.	4.688455853309385
4015. it was faced immediately with a showdown	on the schools an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the	governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education.	3.358469466179903
4016. there followed the historic appropriations and budget fight in	which the general assembly decided to tackle executive powers.	6.0297994653256755
4017. the	final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening	budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information	they need.	3.878936281230144
4018. long-range planning of programs and ways to finance	them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid	crisis-to-crisis government.	6.027086941721585
4019. this session for instance may have	insured	a financial crisis two years from now.	3.738471035733185
4020. in all the turmoil	some good legislation was passed.	7.532879591828134
4021. some other good bills were lost	in the shuffle and await future action.	3.781527451790571
4022. certainly all can applaud passage	of an auto title law the school bills the increase in teacher	pensions the ban on drag racing acceptance by the state of responsibility	for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate	as outside city limits repeal of the college age limit law and the	road maintenance bond issue.	5.1755112280334155
4023. no action has been taken however	on such major problems as ending the fee system penal reform modification	of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks	sales.	3.4566167632105937
4024. only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal	question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state.	5.7358602794647515
4025. the legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations	questions.	4.253150240202589
4026. fortunately it spared us from the usual spate	of silly resolutions which in the past have made georgia look like	anything but the empire state of the south.	6.06597720451121
4027. we congratulate	the entire membership on its record of good legislation.	4.387394236940671
4028. in the	interim between now and next year we trust the house and senate will	put their minds to studying georgia's very real economic fiscal	and social problems and come up with answers without all the political	heroics.	5.087491521033548
4029. the	league of women voters 40 now and admitting it proudly is inviting	financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive.	3.276268618349598
4030. it's a	good use of money.	7.000736797295572
4031. these women whose organization grew out of	the old suffrage movement are dedicated to thomas jefferson's dictum	that one must cherish the people's spirit but keep alive their	attention.	3.12755743031819
4032. if once they become inattentive to the public	affairs jefferson said you and i and congress and assemblies	judges and governors shall all become wolves.	5.0779558596971395
4033. newspapermen	and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention	and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs.	3.668837909163269
4034. the league	workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and	make them available to the public.	5.251444570030935
4035. the harder the choice the more willing	the league is to wade in.	3.441558779832409
4036. and the league takes a stand with great	regularity on the side of right.	6.987547267863945
4037. industrial progress	cities and counties interested in industrial	development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled	toward the 13 northwest	georgia counties that are members of the coosa	valley area planning and development commission.	3.5018291937544346
4038. coupling	its own budget of $83750 with a $30000 state grant authorized by	gov vandiver the group expects to sign a contract in march with	georgia tech.	4.688504891209148
4039. then a full-time planning office will be established	in rome to work with a five-member georgia tech research staff	for development of an area planning and industrial development program.	3.4699939655387095
4040. the undertaking has abundant promise.	5.641912858051462
4041. it recognizes the fact	that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding	together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than	through the go-it-alone approach.	3.275215096331099
4042. states defense	the rusk belief in balanced defense replacing	the	dulles theory of massive retaliation removes a grave danger that	has existed.	4.774081379799702
4043. the danger lay not in believing that our own a-bombs	would deter russia's use of hers; that theory was and is	sound.	3.138030502748806
4044. the danger lay in the american delusion that nuclear deterrence	was enough.	5.622539818941699
4045. by limiting american strength too much to nuclear	strength this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war	besides a nuclear war.	3.6713259494520103
4046. this strategy heightened the possibility that	we would have a nuclear war.	6.298336690071915
4047. it also weakened our diplomatic	stance because russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear	war except in the ultimate extremity.	3.8912023682279644
4048. this left the soviets	plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable	impunity.	5.15348506807533
4049. by maintaining the nuclear deterrent but gearing	american military forces to fight conventional wars too secretary	of state rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more	muscle and greater safety into our military position.	3.081178974789584
4050. shows county is on beam	dekalb's budget for 1961 is a record	one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance.	5.4540153911075935
4051. it includes a raise in the county minimum wage creation	of several new jobs at the executive level financing of beefed-up	industrial development efforts and increased expenditures for essential	services such as health and welfare fire protection sanitation and	road maintenance.	3.1665567954165073
4052. that such expansion can be obtained without	a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal	planning on the part of the board of commissioners headed by chairman	charles o emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust	he was given was well placed and other county officials.	5.452710634534339
4053. somebody is bound to love us	g mennen williams is learning	the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly.	3.477891006277837
4054. touring africa the new	us assistant secretary of state observed africa should be	for the africans and the british promptly denounced him.	5.129427635330322
4055. then he	arrived in zanzibar and found africans carrying signs saying american	imperialists go home.	3.5973971050527958
4056. backs confidence with dollars	confidence in the state's economic	future is reflected in the georgia power company's record construction	budget for this year.	5.034946666874964
4057. the firm does a large amount of	research and its forecasts have meaning.	3.793605197329328
4058. it is good to know that georgia	will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet	the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of	industrialization.	5.329056887729313
4059. georgia's mental health program received a badly needed boost	from the general assembly in the form of a $1750000 budget increase	for the milledgeville state hospital.	3.5279827398682824
4060. actually it amounts	to $1250000 above what the institution already is receiving considering	the additional half-million dollars gov vandiver allocated	last year from the state surplus.	5.197606921786511
4061. either way it sounds like	a sizable hunk of money and is.	4.185335378049946
4062. but exactly how far it will go toward	improving conditions is another question because there is so much that	needs doing.	5.913558508132582
4063. the practice of charging employes for meals whether	they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished.	3.4833483793236173
4064. the work week	of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be	reduced.	5.230420933356836
4065. more attendants nurses and doctors should be hired.	4.728829419051192
4066. patients deserve more attention than they are getting.	6.311405996075548
4067. even with	the increase in funds for the next fiscal year georgia will be spending	only around $3.	4.283210918226098
4068. 15 per day per patient.	8.225768042092303
4069. the national average is	more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental	health field to be too low.	3.5421556146611515
4070. kansas regarded as tops in the nation in	its treatment of the mentally ill spends $9 per day per patient.	5.728056809359526
4071. georgia has made some reforms true.	5.3249388404912805
4072. the intensive treatment program	is working well.	5.338495098183368
4073. but in so many other areas we still are dragging.	5.19454843352215
4074. considering what is being done compared to what needs to be	done it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning	toward making the best possible use of the increase granted.	5.844958612376115
4075. the	boost is helpful but inadequate.	4.591599235110712
4076. assassination even of a tyrant is repulsive	to men of good conscience.	5.739904384237296
4077. rafael trujillo the often-blood thirsty	dictator of the dominican republic for 31 years perhaps deserved	his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history.	3.274486918030144
4078. but whether the murder	of el benefactor in ciudad trujillo means freedom for the people	of the caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered.	4.984975247649647
4079. trujillo knew a great deal about assassination.	5.428509167883088
4080. the responsibility	for scores of deaths including the abduction and murder of jesus	maria galindez a professor at columbia university in new york	has been laid at his door.	4.465656122093912
4081. he had been involved in countless schemes	to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such	as president romulo betancourt of venezuela.	3.6379601479708628
4082. it was a sort of poetic	justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow	the venezuelan government reportedly involving the use of dominican	arms by former venezuelan dictator marcos perez jimenez has	been uncovered and quashed.	5.49982654486314
4083. the recent history of the dominican	republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly	benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive.	4.058852280381406
4084. unquestionably	trujillo did some good things for his country: he improved	public facilities such as roads and sanitation attracted industry and	investment and raised the standard of living notably.	4.728860027526015
4085. but the price	was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition.	4.0428047349815435
4086. el benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth.	6.382594743302801
4087. the jails were	filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his	displeasure.	3.1990140919088272
4088. he maintained amply financed lobbies in the united states	and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise and his	influence extended even to congress.	5.324689594678186
4089. until the last year or so	the profession of friendship with the united states had been an article	of faith with trujillo and altogether too often this profession	was accepted here as evidence of his good character.	3.748057039978142
4090. tardily the government	here	came to understand how this country's own reputation was	tarnished by the association with repression.	5.4307399900383855
4091. last year after trujillo	had been cited for numerous aggressions in the caribbean the	united states and many other members of the organization of american	states broke diplomatic relations with him.	3.9183507332111467
4092. thereupon followed	a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines.	5.760896133434895
4093. trujillo's	dictatorship had been along conservative right-wing lines.	4.13679039630818
4094. but	after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing communist	slogans.	6.066517890775844
4095. there was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with	castro in cuba previously a bete noire to trujillo- thus	illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces.	3.670397571148203
4096. what comes after trujillo is now the puzzle.	7.109281205864621
4097. the	dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little	freedom for a generation and all alternative leadership has been	suppressed.	3.389096524066072
4098. perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability but	the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger.	6.153743781460068
4099. the dominican	republic could turn toward communist-type authoritarianism as easily	as toward western freedom.	3.103115589982288
4100. such a twist would be a tragedy for	the dominican people who deserve to breathe without fear.	6.085679234136228
4101. for that	reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative	government to the dominican republic will need the greatest sympathy	and help.	3.6135249440220236
4102. high-speed buses on the george	washington memorial parkway operating between downtown washington	and cabin john glen echo and brookmont would constitute	an	alluring sample of what the new national capital transportation agency	can do for this city.	4.594656557579113
4103. in presenting plans for such express buses	before the montgomery county council the administrator of the ncta	c darwin stolzenbach was frankly seeking support for	the projects his agency will soon be launching.	3.1709980555560278
4104. such support should	not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the ncta	are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into	the downtown area.	5.119469292119445
4105. because the buses would not stop on the	parkway land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed.	3.709774767455744
4106. the ncta is well advised to seek funds for this purpose	from the present session of congress.	4.8692727689795685
4107. the inference has been too	widely	accepted that because the communists have succeeded in building barricades	across berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of	that living city.	3.133092211701122
4108. so far as the record is concerned the western	powers have not acquiesced and should not do so.	6.566548755004961
4109. though walter	ulbricht by grace of soviet tanks may be head man in east	germany that does not give him any right to usurp the government of	east berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the soviet zone.	3.3991768214326274
4110. the wartime protocol of september 12 1944 designated a special greater	berlin area comprising the entire city to be under joint	occupation.	4.674670611949471
4111. it was not a part of any one of the three	zones for occupation by soviet american british and french troops	respectively.	4.829246315793594
4112. after the berlin blockade and airlift the council	of foreign ministers in 1949 declared a purpose to mitigate the	effects of the present administrative division of germany and of berlin.	5.3276597557879475
4113. for some time the communists honored the distinction	between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin	by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas.	3.884475354900482
4114. then they moved	offices of the east german puppet government into east berlin	and began illegally to treat it as the capital of east germany.	5.90085345683955
4115. that this and the closing of the east berlin-west berlin border	have not	been accepted by the western governments appears in notes which	britain	france and the united states sent to moscow after the latter's	gratuitous protest over a visit of chancellor adenauer and other	west german officials to west berlin.	3.5882612659134145
4116. the chancellor had as	much business there as ulbricht had in east berlin- and was certainly	less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of gerhard	eisler.	4.344207156411012
4117. the british and other replies to that moscow note	pointed out efforts of the communist authorities to integrate east	berlin into east germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting	to make it the capital of east germany.	3.6336786310216653
4118. they insisted on	the fundamental fact that the whole of berlin has a quadripartite	status.	7.033414012370837
4119. this is far from acknowledging or recognizing	those efforts as an accomplished fact.	4.260577408969391
4120. there remains of course the	question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent	the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts.	5.766179250010854
4121. one ground	of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over	into west berlin as communist vopos try to gun down fleeing	unarmed residents.	3.2417863272113303
4122. another remained when an american army car was	recovered but with a broken glass.	6.117954676076828
4123. the glass may seem trivial but communist	official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed.	3.282294268994577
4124. remembering the step-by-step fate of danzig and the	west german misgivings about salami tactics it is to be hoped	that	the dispatch of general clay to west berlin as president kennedy's	representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future	indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed.	5.045459526080289
4125. national park	thousands of buffalo	grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug	upon the rolling dusty-green grassland.	3.509491674912673
4126. a horizon even and seamless	binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth.	5.098161396659147
4127. that	picture of the american prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of	those who have studied the conquest of the american continent as any	later cinema image of the west made in live-oak canyons near hollywood.	3.719947367898117
4128. for it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the	endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of americans	the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the	ohio and mississippi valleys began to fill.	5.385864442688619
4129. the national	park service now proposes to preserve an area in pottawatomie county	northeast kansas as a prairie national park.	3.179060650513649
4130. there the	buffalo would roam to be seen as a tapestry not as moth-eaten zoo	specimens.	6.645678860842427
4131. wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved.	3.7469892671554423
4132. grasslands would extend unfenced unplowed unbroken by silo or barn-	as the first settlers saw them.	4.782565260730315
4133. the park service makes	an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new	park.	3.1471871327027987
4134. american history should clinch the case when congress is asked to	approve.	6.149961912909147
4135. a philadelphia distiller is currently	breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising	on tv and radio.	3.2745336633874267
4136. starting with small stations not members of	the national association of broadcasters the firm apparently is seeking	to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations.	4.984923241877885
4137. probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional	action requiring the federal communications commission	to ban such advertising through its licensing power.	3.4541552446395305
4138. the national	association of broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor	commercials.	5.447297862811195
4139. past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this	policy.	3.761939157367274
4140. even the distilled spirits institute has long had a specific	prohibition.	7.144382316842303
4141. why then with these voluntary barricades and	some state laws barring liquor ads is it necessary to seek congressional	action?	3.872788644134599
4142.  simply because the subverting action of firms that are	not members of the distilled spirits institute and of radio and tv	stations that are not members of the nab tends to spread.	5.590303167299753
4143. soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want	to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly	from the efforts of non-code competitors.	3.843032699770087
4144. although the	false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly	no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which tv	soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied there is a sad difference	between enticing a viewer into sipping oopsie-cola and gulling him	into downing bourbon.	4.4030127361231735
4145. choice	registered democrats in new york city this year have	the opportunity to elect their party's candidates for mayor and	other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization.	3.6678424114660984
4146. in the central contest that for mayor they may have found	some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other.	5.593873477136413
4147. mayor robert f wagner must as his opponents demand assume	responsibility for his performance in office.	3.714386649403995
4148. while all citizens	share in blame for lax municipal ethics the wagner regime has seen serious	problems in the schools law enforcement and fiscal policies.	5.03497022210472
4149. the	mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record.	3.982970047411638
4150. state controller arthur levitt on the other hand cannot effectively	deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders	who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than	in the city's welfare.	5.908449068892688
4151. they too have links with the city's	ills.	4.700219845749803
4152. both men are known to be honest and public-spirited.	7.060245593370183
4153. mayor	wagner's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed	than those of mr levitt who left an impression of quiet competence	in his more protected state post.	3.1222804115974396
4154. as mayor mr levitt	might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters	would like.	6.557166102840142
4155. his election on the other hand would unquestionably	strengthen the regulars.	4.865945603238702
4156. mr wagner might or might	not be a new mayor in this third term now that he is free of	the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls bosses.	5.796915983869148
4157. these	are of course the same people whose support he has only now rejected	to seek the independent vote.	4.009927507114979
4158. but his reelection would strengthen	the liberal democrats and the labor unions who back him.	5.840627079397491
4159. if this choice is less exciting than new york democrats may wish	it nevertheless must be made.	3.9858602233239395
4160. the vote still gives citizens a voice	in the operation of their government and their party.	5.314136346763071
4161. both mr k's have so far continued	to speak softly and carry big sticks over laos.	3.631099666701906
4162. president	kennedy already two quiet demands down still refused thursday to	be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to moscow.	4.936859243485422
4163. but at the same	time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the	fighting.	4.330042832765674
4164. and secretary rusk en route to bangkok doubtless is	trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of australian	or thai seato forces.	4.998907552555641
4165. for mr kennedy speaking	softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad	situation.	4.2398330599434475
4166. the new president is in no position to start out his dealings	with moscow by issuing callable bluffs.	5.51840647175997
4167. he must show at the outset	that he means exactly what he says.	4.357205187144483
4168. in this case he has put	the alternatives clearly to mr khrushchev for the third time.	7.024000898315535
4169. at	his press conference mr kennedy said all we want in laos	is peace not war h a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn.	3.335300965007151
4170. at the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in	unprovocative but ready position.	5.825394268180615
4171. since laos is of no more purely	military value to moscow itself than it is to washington this	approach might be expected to head off mr khrushchev for the moment.	4.186952300161546
4172. but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in	laos the soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride- a course	that would appear to cost him little on the spot but would bog washington	in a tactical mess.	5.8332631692236045
4173. as wars go laos is an extremely	little one.	4.518453782188395
4174. casualties have been running about a dozen men a day.	6.443989687348513
4175. the	hard core of the pro-communist rebel force numbers only some 2000	tough viet minh guerrilla fighters.	3.47723921634946
4176. but for the united states and	its seato allies to attempt to shore up a less tough less combat-tested	government army in monsoon-shrouded road-shy guerrilla-th'-wisp	terrain is a risk not savored by pentagon planners.	5.2765736121047535
4177. but if anything can bring home to mr khrushchev the idea that he	will not really get much enjoyment from watching this	braddock-against-the-indians	contest it will probably be the fact that seato	forces are ready to attempt it- plus the fact that moscow has something	to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations	with washington.	3.629519466068771
4178. fortunately both the republicans and america's	chief western allies now are joined behind the neutral laos	aim of the president.	5.296915151789586
4179. actually it would be more accurate to say that	the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the british	policy of seeking to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargaining	table.	3.9682466884955763
4180. it is ironic that washington is having to struggle	so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable.	5.536622107549929
4181. the state department tacitly rejected the neutral laos idea after	the geneva conference of 1954 and last year washington backed the	rightist coup that ousted neutral premier souvanna phouma.	3.2206017116650894
4182. but	since last fall the united states has been moving toward a pro-neutralist	position and now is ready to back the british plan for a cease-fire	patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of	interested powers.	5.562340636511129
4183. the road to a guaranteed-neutral coup-proof	laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's terrain.	3.3680367289637316
4184. but for the safety of southeast asia and for the sake of the	laotian people- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority	now engaged in the fighting- this last big effort to seal that	country from the cold war had to be made.	5.711122421531372
4185. the world awaits mr khrushchev's	choice of alternatives.	4.0621383863735305
4186. the senate's overwhelming vote to support locally controlled	educational tv efforts should be emulated in the lower	house.	4.574599734393405
4187. twice previously the senate has approved measures backing	etv and the house has let them die.	4.0110355854482584
4188. but this year prospects	may be better.	8.069788666925094
4189. the house communications subcommittee is expected to	report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds.	3.5151308923494695
4190. this year's senate measure would provide each state and the	district of columbia with $1000000 to be used in support of private	state or municipal etv efforts.	5.324870968894771
4191. the funds would be used	for equipment not for land buildings or operation.	3.3593388175697294
4192. the relatively	few communities that have educational stations have found them	of considerable value.	4.8265788449471
4193. but lacking money from commercial sponsors the	stations have had	difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service.	3.41942766082656
4194. other communities- the ones to be aided most by the senate bill-	have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial	cost of equipment.	5.687797285776269
4195. sam rayburn was a good man	a good american and third a good democrat.	4.354934070001721
4196. he was all	of these rolled into one sturdy figure; mr speaker mr sam	and mr democrat at one and the same time.	5.201832595950159
4197. the house was	his habitat and there he flourished first as a young representative	then as a forceful committee chairman and finally in the post for which	he seemed intended from birth speaker of the house and second	most powerful man in washington.	3.3680554485596295
4198. mr rayburn was not an easy	man to classify or to label.	6.53914480060313
4199. he was no flaming liberal yet the new	deal the fair deal and the new frontier needed him.	4.084807504080366
4200. he was	not a rear-looking conservative yet partisans of that persuasion will	miss him as much as any.	5.775981104476738
4201. two of the vital qualities demanded	of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence	and that he keep his word.	3.6356574316565013
4202. sam rayburn took unnumbered secrets with	him to the grave for he was never loquacious and his word once	given was not subject to retraction.	5.480856907077541
4203. it might be added that as he kept	his word so he expected that others keep theirs.	4.182208706370751
4204. the demonstration	of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical.	5.266578602440756
4205. his leadership	was not for audiences.	4.930861792457446
4206. a growl a nod was usually enough.	6.199686331882976
4207. when it	was not one of the great dramas of washington would be presented.	4.939251582434238
4208. he would rise in the well of the house his chin upon his chest his	hands gripping the side of a desk and the political and legislative	chatter would subside into silence.	5.927794046622034
4209. he spoke briefly sensibly	to the point and without oratorical flourishes he made good plain	american common sense and the house usually recognized it and acted	upon it.	3.4174156791541894
4210. these public efforts were rare because mr rayburn	normally did his counseling persuading and educating long before	an issue reached its test on the house floor.	4.713110622826238
4211. he expected democrats	to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them.	4.190360388558874
4212. with	his long service he had a long memory an excellent thing in a political	leader.	6.125532377482299
4213. he was of course in the house for a very long	time.	6.333675205774073
4214. there are only two men remaining in congress who with rayburn	voted for the declaration of war against germany in 1917.	5.926430246971852
4215. to	almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the	existence of mr sam coincided with that of the house.	4.042000179153797
4216. and it was the house he loved.	10.930461672543677
4217. to be presiding officer of it was the	end of his desire and ambition.	4.382436992366503
4218. the senate to him was not the upper	body and he corrected those who said he served under the	president.	5.606029554643334
4219. sound the roll of those	with whom he served and who preceded him in death.	3.7127348931377964
4220. woodrow wilson	with whom he began his years in washington warren g harding	calvin coolidge fdr with whom he managed a social revolution.	5.32533127084964
4221. and those still with us herbert c hoover harry s truman	dwight d eisenhower and john f kennedy.	3.619928674572197
4222. he was	a fighter for those of his own party.	7.768639624223632
4223. mr truman has only to recall	the hopeless campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan	he was and the first experience of mr kennedy with congress would	have been sadder than it was had not mr sam been there.	3.4199186374779735
4224. as it	was his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration.	6.069587401811043
4225. with republican presidents he fought fair.	5.196531463597666
4226. he was	his own man not an automatic obstructionist.	6.2972762483472025
4227. he kept his attacks	on republicanism for partisan campaigns but that is part of the game	he	was born to play.	4.02002245796741
4228. under any name- mr speaker mr	democrat mr sam- he was a good man.	6.977651802969601
4229. thirteen italian airmen who went to the congo to serve the	cause of peace under the united nations banner have instead met violent	death at the hands of congolese troops supposedly their friends.	3.739120200336338
4230. in 18 months no more grisly incident has been reported from that	jungle.	5.843270185199071
4231. simply out of bloodlust their murderers dismembered the	bodies and tossed the remains into the river.	3.5233538162067455
4232. the excuse was offered	for them that they had mistaken the italians for belgian mercenaries.	5.257672954437827
4233. in other words atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central	government might be condoned had the victims been serving the cause	of dissident katanga.	3.466758526807836
4234. does this suggest that the congo	is fit for nationhood or that un is making any progress whatever	toward its goal of so making it?	5.412582295642506
4235.  to the contrary through the past	six	weeks violence has been piled upon violence.	4.314195562867738
4236. mass rapes troop mutinies	uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures	given no sanction by any political authority have become almost	daily occurrences.	4.502044216349777
4237. yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is	not the work of katanga.	4.43969688299801
4238. it happens in the territory of the leopoldville	government which is itself a fiction demonstrably incapable	of governing and commanding only such limited credit abroad as un	support gives it.	4.862612814609587
4239. the main question raised by the incident is	how much longer will un bury its head in the sand on the congo	problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in	present terms?	3.282037828250077
4240.  the probable answer is that it will do so just as long	as russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young african	nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting	ruin on central africa.	5.134522267895666
4241. right now they are pushing	a resolution which would have un use its forces to invade and subjugate	katanga.	3.742511158275207
4242. that notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several	points of view.	6.132294789229754
4243. the un army is too weak too demoralized for	the task.	3.807345808244157
4244. further it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it	is now garrisoned.	6.122274739192419
4245. last it makes no sense to deliver katanga the one	reasonably solid territory into the existing chaos.	3.9055203312042464
4246. the congo	should have been mandated because it was not ready for independence.	6.0695437831768375
4247. the idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed	over wisdom.	3.6965929809398377
4248. it is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because	it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism.	5.816986372020743
4249. but if	any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly it	is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and	urge some new approach.	3.691737952454598
4250. otherwise un will march blindly on to	certain defeat.	6.403358330867087
4251. a recent editorial discussing	a labor-management agreement reached between the southern pacific	co and the order of railroad telegraphers has been criticized	on the grounds that it was not based on complete information.	3.726767402700179
4252. the editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that	the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed	40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction	in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year.	4.87117657275318
4253. our comment	was that this was featherbedding in its ultimate form and that	sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such	an agreement.	3.51216863597893
4254. the statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad	had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers but	that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life.	4.708393884663135
4255. additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad	gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need.	3.8077030532415255
4256. also normal personal attrition would make the job reduction provision	more or less academic.	5.773079965648472
4257. the situation with regard to the southern	pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable	to other situations in other industries.	3.508731250799584
4258. the solution reached in	the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally	included in a series of union demands.	5.293372341153271
4259. time was when the house of delegates	of the american bar association leaned to the common sense	side.	4.352487870041867
4260. but the internationalists have taken over the governing body of	the bar and when the lads met in st louis it was not to grumble	about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the united nations	was scarcely less than wonderful despite an imperfection here and	there.	5.499934767126167
4261. it was the brief writers decided man's best hope	for a peaceful and law abiding world.	3.7767062440113803
4262. peace it's wonderful and	world law it's wonderful too and shouldn't we get an international	covenant extending it into space before the russians put	some claim jumper on the moon?	4.614181005308622
4263.    meanwhile in moscow khrushchev	was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build	a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of tnt to knock	sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice	of surrendering west berlin to communism.	3.1820315728788193
4264. a nuclear pacifier	of these dimensions- roughly some six and a half times bigger	than anything the united states has triggered experimentally- would	certainly produce a bigger bang and just for kicks khrushchev might	use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from st	louis to the moon where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink.	4.890789018955611
4265. while he was at it the philosopher of the kremlin contributed	an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in	the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide.	3.517886435369439
4266. fools	he bayed what do you think you are doing?	6.906049071942213
4267.    the	only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't	playing the marimba with our shoes in the united nations but	perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this	feeble effort.	3.7540801760201004
4268. another evidence of the spreading rule of reason	was provided from mexico city with the daily hijacking of an american	plane by a demented algerian with a gun.	4.9292126922523645
4269. the craft made the familiar	unwelcome flight to havana where for some unknown reason castro	rushed to the airport to express mortification to the colombian	foreign minister a passenger who is not an admirer of old ten o'clock	shadow.	3.141386065810629
4270. the plane was sent back to the united states for	a change but castro kept the crazy gunman who will prove a suitable	recruit to the revolution.	5.600057891135858
4271. less respect for the legal	conventions was displayed by castro's right hand man che guevara	who edified the inter-american economic and social council meeting	in montevideo by reading two secret american documents purloined	from the united states embassy at caracas venezuela.	3.222467636788296
4272. the contents	were highly embarrassing to american spokesmen who were on hand	to promise latin americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium.	4.52337059471565
4273. perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing	american diplomatic papers and planes but the kennedy administration	can always file a demurrer to the effect that but for its own	incompetence in protecting american interests these things would	not happen.	3.319616395219597
4274. the same can be said about the half-hearted cuban invasion	mounted by the administration last april which we trust is not	symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious	khrushchev.	5.048048477242556
4275. pass the iron rations please and light another	candle for it's getting dark down here and we're minded to read	a bit of world law just to pass the time away.	3.2738426761753616
4276. again	the board of suspension of the interstate commerce commission	has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates	on grain as they had planned to do this month.	5.421493488339406
4277. the request for	lower rates originated with the southern railway which has spent	a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which	it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional	smaller car.	3.2562867458436306
4278. by reducing rates as much as 60 per cent it and	its	associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have	lost to truckers and barge lines.	5.879970255796741
4279. the board's action shows	what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws.	3.1855100093182394
4280. word of dag hammarskjold's death	in an african plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe.	5.126028630170375
4281. as head of the united nations he was the symbol of world peace and	his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously.	4.760566392113875
4282. it was	on the eve of a momentous un session to come to grips with cold	war issues.	6.083534480928507
4283. his firm hand will be desperately missed.	4.444835112263898
4284. mr	hammarskjold was in africa on a mission of peace.	6.324995863501331
4285. he had sought	talks with moise tshombe the secessionist president of congo's katanga	province where recent fighting had been bloody.	3.4721061847076573
4286. he earnestly	urged a cease-fire.	7.6259654125735805
4287. the story of the fatal crash is not fully	known.	4.35490694529776
4288. the un-chartered plane which was flying from the conference	city of ndola in northern rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun	bullets last weekend and was newly repaired.	4.302399528926356
4289. whether this or	overt action was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined.	4.3804196729001825
4290. the death of mr hammarskjold removes the united nations'	most controversial leader.	5.784530610102539
4291. he was controversial because he was uncompromising	for peace and freedom with justice.	4.312414465423361
4292. he courageously defended	the rights of small nations and he stood his ground against the	savage attacks of the communist bloc.	5.301117907590668
4293. the congo in whose cause	he died was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs.	4.365256316344564
4294. his policies	had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war	and workable solutions were beginning to take shape.	4.865000454713047
4295. when the recent	katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions mr hammarskjold despite	the danger flew to exert a calming influence.	3.5218399679670642
4296. he gave his life	for his beliefs.	7.627570088030732
4297. the un session scheduled for today	will meet under the cloud of his passing.	3.5317275618483617
4298. it is a crucial session with	the world on the edge of momentous developments.	6.178504042108717
4299. if the manner	of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication	the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason	and justice.	3.5526302016624256
4300. that is the hope of mankind.	10.266702948814826
4301. reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community	has long been one of greater miami's hardest tasks.	3.6529244233117635
4302. too	many have bogged down in bickering.	6.920356848255055
4303. even when public bodies arrived at	a consensus at least one dissenting vote has been usual.	4.155171851426178
4304. so	we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity.	5.955047278309631
4305. all nine members of	the inter-american center authority voted for goodbody + company's	proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center.	3.4179347778557734
4306. the widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms	of its contract.	4.942934089028849
4307. if the indenture is accepted the authority will	proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue.	3.6483916907187304
4308. then goodbody	will hand over a minimum of $15.	7.491348779087041
4309. 5 million for developing the spacious	graves tract to house the center.	4.321748349308661
4310. the next step awaits	approval today by the metro commissioners as the members of the dade	county port authority.	5.580446535334924
4311. they allotted $500000 three years ago to	support interama until its own financing could be arranged.	3.8472803886245006
4312. less than	half the sum has been spent since the interama board pinched pennies	during that period of painstaking negotiations.	5.203990404757073
4313. the balance is being	budgeted for the coming year.	3.9545098385768522
4314. unanimity on interama is not	surprising.	6.973829554449459
4315. it is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly	everyone is agreed.	4.252031494574069
4316. the city of miami recently yielded a prior claim	of $8.	6.195264651673456
4317. 5 million on the graves tract to clear the way for the project.	4.759487970036814
4318. county officials have cooperated consistently.	7.514150639222328
4319. so have the people's	elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels.	5.152265922295986
4320. interama	as it rises will be a living monument to greater miami's	ability	to get together on worthwhile enterprises.	5.7261112279598905
4321. a good one	progress or lack of it toward civil rights in	the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued	last week by the united states commission on civil rights.	3.6945222188006417
4322. much happened in this field during the past 12 months.	8.261106098101873
4323. each state	advisory committee documented its own activity.	4.625628616978833
4324. some accounts are quite	lengthy but florida's is the shortest of all requiring only four	paragraphs.	5.40910199329689
4325. the established pattern of relative calm in the	field of race relations has continued in all areas reported this	group headed by harold colee of jacksonville and including two south	floridians william d singer and john b turner of miami.	2.802227115436146
4326. no complaints or charges have been filed during the past	year either verbally or written from any individual or group.	5.302667687067422
4327. the committee continues to feel that florida has progressed	in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in	its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from	time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights.	3.4102333712721355
4328. problems	have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most	cases with understanding and restraint.	5.136956649789785
4329. the progress reported by the	advisory committee is real.	3.6907954657390283
4330. while some think we move too fast and others	too slowly florida's record is a good one and stands out among	the 50.	5.5102660483699895
4331. west germany will	face the crucial tests that lie ahead on berlin and unification with	a coalition government.	3.618050140178555
4332. this is the key fact emerging from sunday's	national election.	7.218892789453857
4333. chancellor adenauer's christian democratic	party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough	to lose the absolute bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957.	3.3604716661801453
4334. in	order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival	parties which gained strength.	7.242569794906598
4335. inevitably this means some compromise.	5.096103520677512
4336. the aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired.	5.127128423805856
4337. both	willy brandt's social democrats who gained 22 seats in the	new parliament and the free democrats who picked up 23 will insist	on that before they enter the government.	3.1688351953599967
4338. moon-faced ludwig	erhart the economic expert probably will ascend to the leadership	long denied him.	5.186135312727227
4339. if he becomes chancellor dr erhart would	make few changes.	4.513105984517427
4340. the wizard who fashioned west germany's astonishing	industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise.	4.683119282148445
4341. he is dedicated	to building the nation's strength and as are all west germans	to a free berlin and to reunion with captive east germany.	3.492590424151465
4342. what is in doubt as the free germans and their allies consider the	voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result.	6.331328022891136
4343. if the party of adenauer and erhart with 45 per cent of the vote	approaches the party of willy brandt which won 36 per cent the result	would be a stiffening of the old resolve.	3.756802916118962
4344. west berlin's mayor	brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his	city and won votes by it.	5.067424379542095
4345. the free democrats	believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with	the soviet union and more dealings with the communist bloc.	3.6082281499814055
4346. the question left by the election is whether west germany veers slightly	toward more firmness or more flexibility.	5.253649418158295
4347. it could go either	way since the gains for both points of view were about the same.	3.9945922313351594
4348. regardless of the decision two facts are clear.	7.199456858615338
4349. west germany with	its industrial and military might reaffirmed its democracy and remains	firm with the free nations.	3.6640617245414417
4350. and the career of konrad adenauer	who upheld germany's tradition of rock-like leaders which	bismarck	began draws near the end.	5.322973467911634
4351. americans	are a nation of joiners a quality which our friends find endearing	and sometimes amusing.	3.4032203908335994
4352. but it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't	want to make a spectacle of himself.	7.421137499461639
4353. for instance so-called	conservative organizations some of them secret are sprouting	in the garden of joining where liberal organizations once took	root.	3.901110184491125
4354. one specific example is a secret fraternity which	will coordinate anti-communist efforts.	5.908682400702881
4355. the principle is commendable	but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get	gulled.	4.057713896412422
4356. according to the chicago tribune news service	state atty gen stanley mosk of california has devised a series	of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization	seeking his money and his name:  does it assail schools	and churches with blanket accusations?	4.664230990160051
4357.   does it attack other	traditional american institutions with unsupportable and wild charges?	4.149306236618514
4358. 	does it put the label of un-american or subversive on	everyone with whom it disagrees politically?	5.047541595416632
4359.   does it attempt	to rewrite modern history by blaming american statesmen for wars	communism depression and other troubles of the world?	3.6024940522554894
4360.   does	it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone	calls and letter writing campaigns?	4.980171789705976
4361.   do its spokesmen	seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the	principles they purport to advocate?	4.354096847780544
4362.    in some instances a seventh	question can be added:  does the organization show an	affinity for a foreign government political party or personality in opposition	or preference to the american system?	5.225805722560364
4363.    if the would-be	joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists	who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic	apprehensions of americans in a troubled time.	3.6152294407541516
4364. falling somewhere	in a category between einstein's theory and sand fleas- difficult	to see but undeniably there nevertheless- is the tropical green	city of islandia a string of offshore islands that has almost	no residents limited access and an unlimited future.	4.280673047641349
4365. the latter is	what concerns us all.	4.265709711976923
4366. whatever land you can see here from the north	tip end of elliott key looking southward belongs to someone- people	who have title to the land.	5.357521168191591
4367. and what you can't see the land	underneath the water belongs to someone too.	4.424523265209199
4368. the only	real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water	land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater	land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment.	4.83627218990071
4369. in the fairly brief but hectic history of florida the developers	of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours.	3.37772795225594
4370. in this instance happily insistence is being made that our share	is protected.	6.4705124927786075
4371. and until this protection is at least as concrete as	say the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at miami beach	those who represent us all should agree to nothing.	3.281749495343435
4372. the reaction of certain city council members to	california's newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing.	5.040858770099619
4373. we had assumed that at least this local legislative	body had nothing to hide and therefore had no objections to making	the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available	to the public.	3.545740938991759
4374. in the preamble to the open-meeting statutes	collectively known as the brown act the legislature declares that	the public commissions boards and councils and other public agencies	in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business.	5.190110500588569
4375. it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and	that their deliberations be conducted openly.	3.9339595471808577
4376. the people	of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve	them.	5.024074886531815
4377. the people in delegating authority do not give their public	servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and	what is not good for them to know.	4.2330844135502605
4378. the full implementation of	these noble words however has taken the efforts of five sessions of	the legislature.	5.258430896122852
4379. since 1953 california has led the nation in enacting	guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted but not	until this year did the lawmakers in sacramento plug the remaining	loopholes in the brown act.	3.306319028186654
4380. despite the lip service paid by	local governments the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted	by reservations and rationalizations.	5.176585234760137
4381. when all else fails it	is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations.	3.9624172134887963
4382. we submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law- and one	of its principal aims.	6.637284840887097
4383. without public scrutiny the deliberations	of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily.	3.6909846792819967
4384. but the	citizens would of course never be sure that the decisions that resulted	were as correct as they were expeditious.	6.050928861900123
4385. if the dominican republic achieves	free democratic government it will be due in large part to the us	show of force that enabled president balaguer to prevent a threatened	restoration of trujillo dictatorship.	3.5913378797149105
4386. outwardly ciudad	trujillo is calm.	7.204624847895636
4387. none of the trujillo family remains.	5.775022147272703
4388. mr	balaguer is in control and opposition leaders have no further excuse	to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections	in the spring.	5.034573601134772
4389. had us warships not appeared off	the dominican coast there is every possibility that the country would	now be wracked by civil war.	3.544522094290975
4390. ultimately either the trujillos would	have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions	favorable to a takeover by dominican elements responsive to castro	in cuba.	4.871600773762639
4391. within the organization of american states	there may be some criticism of this unilateral american intervention	which was not without risk obviously.	3.9114187297633154
4392. but there was no complaint from	the dominican crowds which lined ciudad trujillo's waterfront	shouting vive yankees! more the us action was hailed	by a principal opposition leader dr juan bosch as having saved	many lives and many troubles in the near future.	4.694501208736808
4393. mr	balaguer's troubles are by no means over.	4.749502559923801
4394. he will need the help	of all oas members to eradicate finally the forces of authoritarianism	pro-trujillo and pro-castro alike.	5.506425645976878
4395. in cooperating toward	that objective oas might move with the speed and effectiveness	demonstrated by the united states.	3.8331457161398057
4396. those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial	unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor	split in 1935.	5.590797169886122
4397. now as then it is a matter of jobs.	6.860368422865186
4398. craft	unions seek work that industrial unions claim such as factory maintenance.	5.497184512715028
4399. the issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession	from the american federation of labor of its industrial union	members.	3.269463664769026
4400. that breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the american	federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations.	5.525015212058587
4401. or that's what it looked like at the time.	4.741663245056274
4402. but automation	and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition	for jobs.	5.458181942686706
4403. walter reuther leader of the industrial union faction	of the afl-cio says another two years of this squabbling	will be disastrous for all american labor.	3.494126493613942
4404. whether it could	be as disastrous for american labor as say jimmy hoffa of the	teamsters is a matter of conjecture.	5.803228253250739
4405. but the jurisdictional disputes	that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for	labor.	3.8793528283812266
4406. engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition	of national survival this country can have little patience with	labor's family feuds.	5.666769747399504
4407. the concept of labor as a special class is	outmoded and in the task confronting america as bastion of the free	world labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself	to survive.	3.71912131687779
4408. the army navy and air	force among others may question secretary freeman's claim that	the high estate of united states agriculture is the strongest	deterrent to the spread of communism.	4.560323443223441
4409. but the secretary insists that	the success of the american farmer is the greatest single source	of strength in the struggle to insure freedom around the world.	4.134506546088871
4410. mr freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on	a recent world trade trip people were more awed by america's capacity	to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production- or	even by the soviet's successes in space.	4.973724607919908
4411. this shouldn't surprise	the secretary; american taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses	for a long long time.	3.5062626400446315
4412. in fact over the years the american	farmer's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large	dollar.	6.105494745194328
4413. and thus far mr freeman has offered very little relief.	4.377208885250775
4414. the 1961 feed grain program which the secretary sponsored	has been declared a billion dollar fiasco.	4.910598360265133
4415. in exchange for higher price	supports growers pledged reduction in planted acreage.	3.8766703606706066
4416. but the	farmers outsmarted washington by shortening the distance between the	rows and pouring on the fertilizer.	5.195822912700659
4417. 1 billion	added to the deficit in the federal budget.	5.116732290754259
4418. perhaps as mr freeman	says american agriculture may stop the communists but it is also	swindling the american taxpayer.	6.229162631158978
4419. a senate subcommittee headed by sen jackson of washington	has been going over the state department and has reached some	predictable conclusions.	3.793677651968737
4420. the department needs a clearer sense of	direction at the top and it needs fewer but better people sen	jackson says.	5.427266825223567
4421. the subcommittee is not alone in questioning	the effectiveness of the department.	3.6940576496916036
4422. president kennedy has indicated	his dissatisfaction with its performance.	7.06285339810272
4423. but those who would	revitalize so complex an organization must first of all overcome the	resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures	suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes.	3.303236983147796
4424. nor does sen	jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in	the white house of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the	study of foreign policy.	5.325649880565623
4425. this tends to create friction and confusion	and has not made it easier for secretary rusk to restore vigor and	initiative among his subordinates.	3.34648397226377
4426. but competent observers believe	he is making progress particularly toward what sen jackson	lists as the primary need- a clearer understanding of where our	vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them.	4.7542590956065665
4427. the jackson report will provide some of the political support	mr rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel	engaged as sen jackson puts it in work that does not really	need doing.	3.7784006162215387
4428. mr rusk should also draw comfort from sen jackson's	recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national	security problems be improved.	5.037185056220068
4429. self-criticism is a rare but needed	commodity in congress.	4.067624214772574
4430. forecasting	economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist.	6.302854755989116
4431. but now apparently the job of secretary of labor requires that he	be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment	trends.	4.028959158095038
4432. james p mitchell when he was the head of the department	promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below	three million a couple of years ago.	6.198520211278692
4433. he lost but settled for a cake	in the shape of a fedora.	4.3267782321299775
4434. his successor secretary goldberg	also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which	has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months.	5.1707243281732165
4435. no	betting man mr goldberg says he's merely putting my neck out	again by predicting the rate will go down this month.	3.2105892681856294
4436. he is basing	his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened	its stride- a new record high in personal income an increase	in housing starts a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for	durable goods.	4.6799515592133325
4437. mr mitchell had an excuse for losing- the	steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated.	3.757095654364282
4438. mr goldberg	has less reason for missing.	7.550959601928385
4439. the economy seems to be sailing along on	an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an	end so they can't be blamed in november.	3.1275303996724673
4440. the odds thus appear favorable	that the secretary's neck may be spared.	4.95483554697091
4441. cambodia's chief of state who has been accused of	harboring communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for	neighboring south viet nam and thailand insists he would be very	unhappy if communism established its power in southeast asia.	3.3171901172382556
4442. but so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph is prince	sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel.	5.953735745310893
4443. i have to see the	facts is the way the prince puts it.	5.672980825774694
4444. and from that point of vantage	he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-western	posture.	5.7762132550733485
4445. prince sihanouk's powers of prognostication	some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the	courage of his convictions.	3.4773731055402894
4446. commerce secretary hodges seems to have	been cast in the role of pacemaker for official washington's economic	forecasters.	5.790073981949304
4447. weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second	quarter of this year while his colleagues in the cabinet were shaking	their heads in disagreement.	3.432787725830262
4448. recently treasury secretary dillon and	labor secretary goldberg fell into line with mr hodges' appraisal	though there has been some reluctance to do so at the white	house.	5.524896308209572
4449. and now mr hodges has pioneered further into the	economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped	sliding and that it should start going upward from this point.	3.7615854019386274
4450. he	is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump.	7.390823752013518
4451. the secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail	sales.	3.909194284059104
4452. february's volume was 1 per cent above january's for the	first pickup since last october although it's still 1.	5.157097727500639
4453. 5 per cent	off from february 1960.	5.332889050507437
4454. corroborating mr hodges' figures	was the federal reserve board's report of the large sales increase	in the nation's department stores for the week ending march 4.	5.25064289172906
4455. in newark for example this gain was put at 26 per cent above the	year-earlier level.	3.8700413846376875
4456. of course some of the credit for the sale boost	must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter	comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960.	6.774988328585166
4457. another optimistic	sign this one from the labor department was the report that	the long rise in unemployment compensation payments was interrupted	for the first time in the week ending feb 25.	4.0423060983613315
4458. initial claims	for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8100 in the week	ending march 4.	5.48137404417279
4459. mr hodges is so hopeful over the outlook	that he doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes.	4.0638033242303555
4460. well we can't have everything.	8.19181342513384
4461. prosperity for the whole nation	is certainly preferred to a tax cut.	4.454297960000184
4462. new jersey folk need not be told of the builder's march to	the sea for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles	of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that	remain.	5.398752821850719
4463. now the stone harbor bird sanctuary 31 acres of magic attraction	for exotic herons is threatened but the battlefront extends	far beyond our state.	3.4220170971640957
4464. against the dramatic fight being waged	for preservation of 30 miles of cape cod shoreline the tiny tract	at stone harbor may seem unimportant.	5.058989194686782
4465. but interior secretary udall	warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few	surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment	of all as public preserves.	3.8639488852346013
4466. the move for establishment	of a national seashore park on 30000 acres of cape cod from provincetown	to chatham is strengthened by president kennedy's interest	in that area.	4.4236462524490365
4467. but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape	is of more than regional concern for the automobile age has made it the	recreation spot of people from all over the country.	3.883529672230918
4468. by comparison	stone harbor bird sanctuary's allies seem less formidable	for aside from the audubon society they are mostly the snowy	common and cattle egrets and the louisiana green little blue and	black-crowned herons who nest and feed there.	4.508610858920242
4469. but there is hope for	conservation commissioner bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the	kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its	park space.	3.5611396661054964
4470. the desirability of preserving such places as the	cape dunes and stone harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every	year.	4.6411831484206285
4471. public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is	growing.	4.1640411247642115
4472. but that heritage is shrinking even faster.	7.3204196661506815
4473. much of the glamor president kennedy's peace corps	may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by sargent	shriver the head corpsman.	3.593481612566811
4474. anybody who is expecting a joyride	should according to mr shriver get off the train right now.	5.258815632271104
4475. first of all the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling.	5.341050409171837
4476. it will be a 16-hour training day.	9.39248185053188
4477. then off to a remote place in	an underdeveloped country where the diet culture language and living	conditions will be different.	3.766266598086489
4478. and the pay of course will be nil.	7.932353133673342
4479. despite all this the idea apparently has captured the imagination	of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by	the response than anybody else.	3.38707627933337
4480. the study of the st louis area's economic prospects prepared	for the construction industry joint conference confirms and	reinforces both the findings of the metropolitan st louis survey	of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the missouri-illinois	countryside.	4.977666347714883
4481. st louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing	and in some places stagnant mid-continent region.	4.072009654791848
4482. slackened	regional demand for st louis goods and services reflects the region's	relative lack of purchasing power.	5.2366113967159444
4483. not all st louis industries	of course have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood.	4.101091933932117
4484. but for those which do the slow growth of the area has a retarding	effect on the metropolitan core.	6.90272207995725
4485. the city has a stake in stimulating	growth and purchasing power throughout outstate missouri and southern	illinois.	3.4952918897775525
4486. gov dalton's new commerce and industry	commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective	effort to attract new industry.	5.375209431723499
4487. another	would be to take the advice of dr elmer ellis president of	the university of missouri and provide for an impartial professional	analysis of missouri's economy.	3.490908559397819
4488. he says the state in order to	proceed with economic development must develop an understanding of how	the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the	national economy.	5.477010502136237
4489. the research center of the university's	school of business and public administration is prepared to undertake	the analysis dr ellis has been talking about.	3.3602659108629367
4490. he and dean	john w schwada of the business school outlined the project at	a recent conference.	5.530580655092743
4491. the university can make a valuable contribution	to the state's economic development through such a study.	3.5885989714226016
4492. in southern illinois the new federal program of help to economically	depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth.	5.289810159461876
4493. the carbondale	industrial development corp has obtained a $500000 loan	to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate	production that will provide 500 new jobs.	3.0058476439666837
4494. carbondale is in the	herrin-murphysboro-west	frankfort labor market where unemployment	has been substantially higher than the national average.	5.299671260853175
4495. the federal	program eventually should have a favorable impact on missouri's depressed	areas and in the long run that will benefit st louis as	well.	3.642737539591257
4496. politics-ridden st clair county in illinois presents	another piece of the problem of metropolitan development.	6.469620015356213
4497. more industrial	acreage lies vacant in st clair county than in any other	jurisdiction in the st louis area.	4.007862540461562
4498. the unstable political situation	there represents one reason new plants shy away from the east side.	5.295552515224852
4499. and then there is st louis county where the democratic	leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning	of the important relationship between proper land use and economic	growth.	3.811281644811768
4500. st louis county under its present leadership also has	largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform and permitted	parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests.	5.115145969136211
4501. some	plant-location specialists take these signs to mean st louis	county doesn't want industry and so they avoid the area and more	jobs are lost.	3.3816774187263707
4502. metropolitan st louis's relatively slow	rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political business	civic and other leaders on both sides of the mississippi.	5.989618769852972
4503. without	a great acceleration in the metropolitan area's economy there will	not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters and st	louis will slip into second-class status.	3.218652350641392
4504. many of our very best friends are reformers.	7.775711367913186
4505. still we must confess	that sometimes some of them go too far.	4.755385047588522
4506. take for example the reformers	among new york city's democrats.	7.3074462437019365
4507. having whipped mr de	sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of tammany hall	they have changed the name to chatham hall.	3.4853257269598488
4508. even though headquarters	actually have been moved into the chatham building do they believe	that they can make the new name stick?	5.904151953454788
4509.    granted that the tammany	name and the tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political	shame the sachems of the hall also have a few good marks to	their credit.	3.222381184352216
4510. but it is tradition rather than the record which balks	at the expunging of the tammany name.	6.385878764611996
4511. after all it goes back to the	days in which sedition was not un-american the days in which the sons	of st tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force	and violence- the british government that is.	3.574413709206537
4512. further do	our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent	to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo?	5.328987830691555
4513.  they will- when they	give up the donkey and the elephant.	3.9581261874261098
4514. instead of attempting the impossible	why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger's	stripes are not black?	5.769141508906325
4515.  that might go over.	6.420027721571357
4516. the	white house itself has taken steps to remove a former batista official	col mariano faget	from his preposterous position as interrogator	of cuban refugees for the immigration service.	4.7419837192074645
4517. the	faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds.	4.132237586151741
4518. the kennedy	administration had assured anti-castro cubans that it would have	nothing to do with associates of dictator batista.	5.383194267365495
4519. using a batista	man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic	forces which alone can effectively oppose castro.	3.5078342401966465
4520. moreover	col faget's information on cuba was too outdated to be	useful in screening castro agents; the colonel fled to the	friendly haven of the dominican dictatorship as soon as castro seized	power.	4.813854858342629
4521. and while he had headed batista's anti-communist	section	the batista regime did not disturb the communists so much as more open	opponents who were alleged to be communists.	3.5683249550289293
4522. responsibility	for the faget appointment rests with gen j m swing an	eisenhower appointee as head of the immigration service.	5.227492447244603
4523. gen swing	has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the	prerogatives of his office.	3.9376434123914117
4524. his official term expired last summer.	6.63661696177807
4525. some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend	congressman walter of pennsylvania at a moment when the kennedy	administration was diligently searching for all the house votes it	could get.	3.436658536553786
4526. congressman walter has been all-powerful in immigration	matters but he has announced plans to retire in 1962.	5.526853771300665
4527. at that	point the administration will have little reason to hang onto gen	swing.	4.659495849327184
4528. the faget case was the kind of salvage job the administration	should not have to repeat.	5.8550321030290275
4529. as	president dwight d eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from	the strife of partisan politics.	3.430644967368585
4530. as a former president however mr	eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during	a new york republican rally and generally missed his target.	5.118365291751427
4531. mr eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost	by a peace corps girl in nigeria to attack the entire corps as a	juvenile experiment and to suggest sending a corps member to the	moon.	3.277484349282098
4532. nowhere did the speaker recognize	the serious purpose of the corps or its welcome reception abroad.	5.727081107312925
4533. his	words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name	to the eisenhower exchange fellowships dedicated to the same goal	of international understanding.	3.8727524207744377
4534. the former president blithely	ignored recent history in speaking of dollarette dollars under	kennedy administration fiscal policies.	4.920748137595253
4535. it was the eisenhower administration	which produced the largest peacetime deficit.	4.557325020321959
4536. finally	mr eisenhower found nothing but confusion in washington.	6.081489361130832
4537. this statement recalls the 1959 berlin crisis when president eisenhower	first told reporters that berlin could not be defended with conventional	weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the	picture too.	3.4120112174936224
4538. the crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion	has hardly been compounded.	5.141289184525503
4539. ex-presidents relieved of accountability	for policy sometimes seem to feel free of accountability	for their words.	3.5283184986174163
4540. some of former president truman's off-the-cuff	discourses have been in that vein.	7.44446567883036
4541. nobody can deny the right of former	chief executives to take part in politics but the american people	expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership	and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility.	3.779802746788595
4542. this is a matter	of respect for the presidency.	8.171259927053482
4543. mr eisenhower's new york speech	does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship.	3.7476272026315507
4544. the queen mary has long been a symbol of	speed luxury and impeccable british service on the high seas.	5.152510806873981
4545. reports	that the venerable liner which has been in service since 1936 was	to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us.	3.707070710381552
4546. but the cunard	line influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment has	decided to keep the queen mary in service until next spring at least.	5.337868608488342
4547. a new queen with the prosaic title of q3 had been planned	for several years to replace the queen mary.	3.6547897882546656
4548. the british government	concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding	industry had put through a bill to give cunard loans and grants totaling	$50400000 toward the $84000000 cost of a new 75000-ton passenger	liner.	4.8768082736677245
4549. since 1957 more and more trans-atlantic passengers	have been crossing by air.	4.384812954314257
4550. economy class fares and charter flights	have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines.	5.555589087358136
4551. competition	from other steamship lines has cut cunard's share of sea passengers	from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked	drop of profits on the atlantic run.	3.129934852389067
4552. the cunard line has	under consideration replacing the queen mary with a ship smaller than	75000 tons.	5.038253456185083
4553. this would be cheaper to operate and could be used for	cruises during the lean winter months.	4.4198407223403295
4554. also under consideration is	an increased investment in cunard eagle airways which has applied to	serve new york.	5.124472008824282
4555. the decline of the cunard line from its position	of dominance in atlantic travel is a significant development	in the history of transportation.	3.551087158882538
4556. gen maxwell	taylor's statement in saigon that he is very much encouraged	about the chances of the pro-western government of viet nam	turning back communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement	that he will not recommend dispatching united states troops to	bolster the vietnamese army.	4.982398654346115
4557. gen taylor will report to president	kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to south viet	nam and judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the far east	he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of vietnamese	military economic political and other resources.	3.7524235973006763
4558. there was	good reason for gen taylor to make an inspection trip at this time.	6.525248711179799
4559. communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their	activities and the great flood of the mekong river has interposed a	new crisis.	3.5498793373024027
4560. south viet nam's rice surplus for next year- more than	300000 tons- may have been destroyed.	5.6982113903124105
4561. the viet cong the communist	rebels may have lost their stored grain and arms factories.	3.123170373823548
4562. the	rebels may try to seize what is left of the october harvest when the	floods recede and the monsoon ends in november.	5.066827326000608
4563. nothing that	is likely to happen however should prompt the sending of united	states soldiers for other than instructional missions.	3.5679759360994274
4564. the indochina	struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954 when gen ridgway	estimated	it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win	a war the french were losing.	4.90310523893971
4565. it is a war to stay out of today especially	in view of the fact that president ngo dinh diem apparently	does not want united states troops.	4.077028010365066
4566. he may want additional technical	help and this should be forthcoming.	7.016026047429458
4567. south viet nam has received	$1450000000 in united states aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance	has been stepped up since vice president lyndon b johnson's	visit last may.	3.3998677816939002
4568. gen taylor the president's	special military adviser is a level-headed officer who is not likely	to succumb to propaganda or pressure.	5.264619940641197
4569. it is probable that his recommendations	will be informed and workable and that they will not lead to	involving the united states in an asian morass.	4.159276141561146
4570. gov john m dalton himself a lawyer and a man of long	service in government spoke with rich background and experience when	he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the	missouri general assembly or quit accepting fees from individuals	and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the	government and who are retained not because of their legal talents	but because of their government influence.	4.658993612946903
4571. ambassador stevenson yesterday	described the u n's problem of electing a temporary	successor to the late dag hammarskjold as the gravest crisis the	institution has faced.	3.370338433697032
4572. if the decision goes wrong	it may be- as mr stevenson fears- the first step on the	slippery path downhill to a u n without operational responsibilities	and without effective meaning.	4.836545875563292
4573. the integrity of the	office not merely requires that the secretary general shall be as	the charter puts it the chief administrative officer of the organization	but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions	from any government or any other authority external to	the organization.	3.0155509118551307
4574. in other words the secretary general is to be	a nonpartisan international servant not a political national one.	6.096464012328707
4575. he should be as dag hammarskjold certainly was a citizen of the	world.	4.084314752492883
4576. the charter does stipulate that due regard shall	be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical	basis as possible.	4.840638412618526
4577. the united states and its allies have	had no objection to this.	4.461080260425619
4578. what they have objected to is the attempt	of the russians to make use of the tragedy of dag hammarskjold's	death to turn the entire u n staff from the secretary down	into political agents of the respective countries from which they come.	5.3459404668067805
4579. the controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic	origin of the deputies of the secretary general and more particularly	around the nature of his relationship with them.	3.640342055459367
4580. although	the united states and the u s s r have been arguing	whether there shall be four five or six top assistants the most important	element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the	manner in which these deputies are to do their work.	5.983034973309627
4581. if any one	of them has any power to veto the secretary general's decisions	the nature of the organization will have changed.	4.190374593456003
4582. if they give him advice	when he asks it or if they perform specified duties under his direction	the nature of the u n will not of necessity change.	6.034422043728876
4583. the secretary general must have subject to the constitutional direction	of the security council and the general assembly the power	to act to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled	by advisers and assistants acting on someone else's instructions.	3.3020523332600424
4584. this is the root issue for which the united states should stand.	8.026667787122882
4585. we should not become confused or let our public become confused over	irrelevant questions of number or even of geography.	3.90677023522479
4586. what we must	have if the united nations is to survive is as nonpolitical nonpartisan	an organization at the top as human beings can make it subject	to no single nation's direction and subservient to no single nation's	ambition.	5.398670096161599
4587. the new city charter	which should get a yes vote as question no 1 on nov 7 would	not make a good mayor out of a bad one.	3.5400800588430417
4588. there is no such magic	in man-made laws.	7.651009054725007
4589. but it would greatly strengthen any mayor's executive	powers remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of	inaction in the board of estimate increase his budget-making authority	both as to expense and capital budgets and vest in him the right	to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy.	3.493230248535401
4590. lawmaking power is removed from the board of estimate	and made	a partnership responsibility of the city council and the mayor.	7.083750549591334
4591. thus	there is a clearer division of authority administrative and legislative.	4.138959470053728
4592. the board is diminished in both respects while it retains control	over zoning franchises pier leases sale leasing and assignment	of property and other trusteeship functions.	4.637256648550608
4593. the board will be able	to increase decrease add or eliminate budget items subject to the	mayor's veto; but the city council will now share fully this	budget-altering power.	3.3694967428042677
4594. overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes	will require concurrence by board and council and a two-thirds vote.	4.893189537993719
4595. the controller retains his essential fiscal watchdog functions;	his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed.	3.052877207324982
4596. he loses now-misplaced tax collection duties which go to the finance	department.	6.274274202756155
4597. on net balance in spite of controller gerosa's	opposition to the new charter as an invasion of his office the controller	will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government	than he has now.	3.688830147894053
4598. borough presidents while retaining	membership in the board of estimate lose their housekeeping functions.	5.952655257066091
4599. highways go to a new department of highways sewers to the department	of public works such street cleaning as borough presidents	now do to the sanitation department.	3.477847217164782
4600. some fiscal changes are important.	7.627422150015641
4601. the expense budget	is to be a program budget and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy	in fund transfers within a department.	3.444783948202813
4602. the capital budget for construction of permanent improvements becomes	an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises;	but as a second-look safeguard each new project must undergo	a board of estimate public hearing before construction proceeds.	4.427962824938135
4603. a road block to desirable local or borough improvements heretofore	dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on	progress is removed by making these a charge against the whole city	instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected.	3.056178599749142
4604. this will	have a beneficial effect by expediting public business; it will also	correct some injustices.	4.953833055851816
4605. enlargement of the city council	and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow.	4.3593613337819805
4606. the inter-american press association	which blankets the western hemisphere from northern canada to cape	horn is meeting in new york city this week for the first time in	eleven years.	5.513192772649281
4607. the i a p a is a reflection of the problems	and hopes of the hemisphere; and in these days this inevitably	means a concentration on the effects of the cuban revolution.	3.4451786284262074
4608. as the press in cuba was gradually throttled by the castro regime	more and more cuban publishers editors and correspondents were forced	into exile.	5.128733442754521
4609. the i a p a found itself driven from journalism	into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall	of the castro government and the return of the cuban press to the	freedom it knew before batista's dictatorship began in 1952.	3.1983690143197014
4610. freedom of the press was lost in cuba because of decades of corruption	and social imbalances.	6.606224526959638
4611. in such conditions all freedoms are lost.	4.8132943770946985
4612. this in more diplomatic language is what adlai stevenson told the	newspaper men of latin america yesterday on behalf of the united states	government.	6.236703965334702
4613. he felt able to end on a note of hope.	4.437501035249497
4614. he sees evidence	of fair winds for the ten-year alliance for progress plan with	its emphasis on social reforms.	5.183193599442892
4615. no group can contribute more to the	success of the program than the editors and publishers of the inter-american	press association.	3.8863571185015
4616. the twenty-second	soviet communist party congress opens in moscow today in a	situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago	when this meeting was first announced.	4.5137469458289825
4617. according to the original program	premier khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the kremlin	this morning to be filled with admiration or rage- depending	upon individual or national politics- because of the bold program	for building communism in our time which the congress will adopt.	3.356307428953514
4618. but far from being concerned about whether or not russia will have	achieved utopia by 1980 the world is watching moscow today primarily	for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear armageddon in	the immediate future.	5.441163027972301
4619. the evident contradiction between the rosy	picture of russia's progress painted by the communist party's	program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by premier	khrushchev's berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that	the program may be severely altered.	2.881586037460151
4620. whether it is or not the propaganda	impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted	at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated.	6.24712991081947
4621. and there must be many soviet citizens who know what is going on	and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised	for 1980 they and their children must first survive.	3.7203313999239684
4622. this	congress will see premier khrushchev consolidating his power and	laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness	remove him from the scene in the next few years.	5.092689281825654
4623. the widespread purge	that has taken place the past twelve months or so among communist	leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who	will dominate the congress and the central committee it will elect	will all have passed the tightest possible khrushchev screening both	for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job.	3.0917730742401757
4624. dr james b conant has	earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer.	5.656118182980611
4625. his earlier reports considered the american public schools	basically sound and not in need of drastic change.	4.090481804140108
4626. now a close look	at the schools in and around the ten largest cities including new york	has shattered this optimism.	6.063166277393707
4627. dr conant has come away shocked	and angry.	5.00727247663463
4628. his new book entitled slums and suburbs calls for	fast and drastic action to avert disaster.	5.384321871729479
4629. there is room for	disagreement concerning some of dr conant's specific views.	4.1932702992155635
4630. his	strong opposition to the transfer of negro children to schools outside	their own neighborhood in the interest of integration will be	attacked by negro leaders who have fought for and achieved this open	or permissive enrollment.	4.946470360029366
4631. dr conant may underestimate the psychological	importance of even token equality.	4.216706659305592
4632. his suggestion that	the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical	law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges	themselves- even though what he is recommending is already taking	shape as a trend.	4.797474278119159
4633. but these are side issues to a powerful	central theme.	4.736704003709135
4634. that theme cuts through hypocrisies complacency and	double-talk.	6.877353790410196
4635. it labels the slums especially the negro slums as dead-end	streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters.	4.009350584229012
4636. the villains	of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters	and dr conant accuses employers and labor unions alike.	4.844894421778637
4637. the facts	he adds are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling	bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration	rather than on real improvement of the schools regardless of	the color of their students.	2.986658759228999
4638. a call for action before it	is too late has alarming implications when it comes from a man who	in his	previous reports on the schools cautioned so strongly against extreme	measures.	5.366823090342811
4639. these warnings must not be treated lightly.	5.137247105405767
4640. dr conant's	conscientious selfless efforts deserve the nation's	gratitude.	6.747163326293677
4641. he has served in positions of greater glamour both at home and abroad;	but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward	report on the state of the public schools.	4.021196226415974
4642. a fascinating letter has just reached	this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail.	4.942282258431797
4643. he was delighted to learn that the post office department is now	going to expand this service to deliver mail from representatives	in congress to their constituents without the use of stamps names addresses	or even zone numbers.	3.5974362320881386
4644. in accordance with legislation passed	at the last session of congress each representative is authorized to	deliver to the post office in bulk newsletters speeches and other	literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district.	5.153886716628544
4645. this means	an added burden to innumerable postmen who already are complaining	of heavy loads and low pay and it presumably means an increased postal	deficit but our correspondent writes think of the additional junk	mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis.	3.0490215456759113
4646. letter writing is a dying	art.	7.345973904143394
4647. occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and	many are written by companies to one another but these are mostly	typewritten.	3.834605068447196
4648. most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly	be called a letter.	6.004032551725048
4649. old tired trembling the woman came to the cannery.	4.914589715716323
4650. she had	she said heard that the plant was closing.	6.480479496729324
4651. it couldn't close she	said.	5.900137214530782
4652. she had raised a calf grown it beef-fat.	7.126343159865994
4653. she had with her own	work-weary hands put seeds in the ground watched them sprout bud	blossom and get ready to bear.	3.7332208709326835
4654. she was ready to kill the beef dress	it out and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup broth	hash and stew against the winter.	5.533444148396861
4655. she had done it last year and	the year before and the year before that and she and her people	were dependent upon these cans for food.	3.6669341883183026
4656. this did not happen in	counties of north georgia where the rivers run and make rich the	bottom land.	5.513591666608852
4657. nor in south georgia where the summer sun shines warmly	and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields.	3.758493249136576
4658. this happened in decatur dekalb county not 10 miles from the	heart of metropolitian atlanta.	5.301784476652381
4659. and now the woman tired and	trembling came here to the dekalb county cannery.	4.368797132017946
4660. is it so the	cannery is going to close?	8.838285842241815
4661.    o n moss 61 tall	grey as a possum canning plant chief since 1946 didn't know what	to say.	3.511460046139656
4662. he did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this	summer.	6.252916318421762
4663. he did say he was out of cans the no 3's but i requisitioned	22000.	4.679075569373102
4664. he said he had no 2's enough to last two	weeks more.	7.250834324515205
4665. threat of closing the cannery is a recent one.	4.73803117807008
4666. a	three-man committee has recommended to commission chairman charles	o emmerich that the dekalb county cannery be closed.	5.098264175847768
4667. reason:	the cannery loses $3000 yearly.	4.441509347484829
4668. but dekalb citizens those	who use the facilities of the cannery say the cannery is not supposed	to make any money.	5.780083154438138
4669. the cannery said mrs lewellyn	lundeen an active booster of the cannery since its opening during	the war and rationing years of 1941 to handle the victory garden	produce is a service to the taxpayer.	3.20232135959004
4670. and one of the best services	available to the people who try to raise and can meat to plant	grow vegetables and put them up.	6.563472822220713
4671. it helps those people who help themselves.	5.072620134014488
4672. the county though seems more interested in those	people who don't even try those who sit and draw welfare checks and	line up for surplus food.	4.5149431834673885
4673. a driver of a dairy truck who	begins work at 1 am finishes before breakfast then goes out and	grows a garden and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family	of five asked what in the world will we do?	3.3049994775332387
4674.    what	in the world echoed others those come with the beans potatoes	the tomatoes will any of us do?	5.136875542792517
4675.    moss a man who knows	how much the cannery helps the county doesn't believe it will close.	4.071366209115369
4676. but he is in the middle an employe of dekalb but on the side	of the people.	7.890571745712896
4677. the young married people; the old couples.	4.138638166584539
4678. the	dairy truck driver; the old woman with the stew.	5.8955985562358775
4679. don't	ask me if i think the cannery helps he said.	4.713675353985574
4680. sir i know	the cannery helps.	8.138056913100796
4681. most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard.	5.419776969885086
4682. when a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or	hardship it is not always easy to say just forget it.	6.068539995425453
4683. there	is one thing i know; a person will never have spiritual poise and inner	peace as long as the heart holds a grudge.	4.140441327924499
4684. i know a man who held	resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades.	7.913677158026538
4685. several years	ago i was his pastor.	5.2848244478535324
4686. one night at the close of the evening service	he came forward left his resentment at the altar and gave his	heart to god.	6.290487906002698
4687. after almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story	of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on	his land.	3.844994074373589
4688. we tried to settle this dispute he said but	could never come to an agreement.	5.763123212202917
4689. i settled it tonight he continued.	4.7858361537801555
4690. i leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has	been lifted off my heart i have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven	my neighbor.	5.452882573631214
4691. forgiveness is the door through which a	person must pass to enter the kingdom of god.	4.214211140184341
4692. you cannot wear the banner	of god and at the same time harbor envy jealousy and grudges in	your heart.	6.323231854065517
4693. henry van dyke said forgive and forget if you can;	but forgive anyway.	3.735377363435076
4694. jesus made three things clear about	forgiveness.	7.18441647749278
4695. we must first of all be willing to forgive others before	we can secure god's forgiveness.	4.556847095889399
4696. for if ye forgive men their	trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you: but if ye	forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive	your trespasses.	4.6985648824459725
4697. it will do no good to seek	god's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong.	4.383613396298611
4698. then jesus indicated that god's forgiveness is unlimited.	6.547726347028007
4699. in the prayer jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these	words forgive us our debts.	3.4693810072894085
4700. when a person meets god's requirements	for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven.	6.605900222208336
4701. god's mercy	and patience will last forever.	4.273578568509461
4702. forgiveness implies more than a person	wanting his past sins covered by god's love.	6.089265401502854
4703. it also implies	that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past.	4.0789300274126905
4704. we want the past forgiven but at the same time we must be willing for	god to direct the future.	6.763982603915819
4705. finally we must be willing to forgive	others as many times as they sin against us.	4.644068321522927
4706. once peter asked	how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him?	5.795330268485805
4707.  till	seven times?	6.235438618222183
4708.  jesus saith unto him until seventy times seven.	6.530924869035571
4709. jesus not only taught forgiveness he	gave us an example of it on the cross.	4.514866758277277
4710. with all the energy of his broken	body he prayed father forgive them for they know not what	they do.	6.025923938409243
4711. she's been in and out of my house for a dozen years now although	she's still a teen-ager who looks like a baby she is getting	married.	3.7809022339785265
4712. her mother now dead was my good friend and when she came to	tell us about her plans and to show off her ring i had a sobering wish	to say something meaningful to her something her mother would wish	said.	4.978121296090255
4713. for a while there was such shrill girlish commotion i couldn't	have made myself heard if i'd had the equivalent of the message	to garcia.	3.7099520450627885
4714. but when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been	through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young	female- six girls sprawled on one bed drinking cokes and giggling-	she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute.	5.500939625452731
4715. how	do you know you love somebody enough to get married?	4.175745447673009
4716.  she asked.	11.221386398712887
4717. it was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have	ever asked: how can you be sure?	4.002233966516079
4718.    aren't you sure?	8.372310913027198
4719. 	i asked looking at her searchingly.	4.366251503835873
4720. i wanted to grab her by the	arm and beg her to wait to consider to know for certain because life	is so long and marriage is so important.	4.985715597920138
4721. but if she were just having	a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten	her out of a really good marriage.	3.9490886276349753
4722. besides in all honesty i don't	know how you can be sure.	6.2557556019286995
4723. i don't know any secret recipe for certainty.	4.319507003372295
4724. in the fevered intoxicating breathless state of being in love	the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships	are sometimes obscured.	4.724967580371474
4725. i knew of but one test and i threw it	out to her for what it was worth.	3.944065198136909
4726. does he ever bore you?	9.07991253757802
4727. 	i asked.	6.235438618222183
4728. bore me?	9.442765408986238
4729.  she was shocked.	7.290328263727336
4730. oh no-o! why	he's so darling and h   i mean i went on ruthlessly	when he's not talking about you or himself or the wonders	of love is he interesting?	4.86407432338468
4731.  does he care about things that matter	to you?	5.063045991010175
4732.  can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island	for years and years and still find him fascinating?	5.772556604326832
4733.    because	honey i thought silently there are plenty of desert islands in	every marriage- long periods when you're hopelessly stranded together.	3.2912331687416905
4734. and if you bore each other then heaven help you.	7.001797673988636
4735. she came	back the other day to reassure me.	4.5004554676483846
4736. she has studied and observed and	she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting.	6.698136921621827
4737. she asked if i had other advice and heady with success	i rushed it in i hope not too late.	3.709569085656714
4738. be friends with your mother-in-law.	8.951108560831399
4739. jokes cartoons and cynics to the contrary mothers-in-law make	good friends.	3.8594057640660555
4740. i do not know dr wilson sneed well.	8.050091763620038
4741. but i was deeply moved	by his letter of resignation as rector of st luke's church	in atlanta.	3.8876153547814676
4742. it was the cry of not just one heart; it spoke for many	in the clergy i suspect.	5.625686894994259
4743. the pulpit is a lonely place.	3.970749300494941
4744. who stops	to think of that?	8.439797924812085
4745.    imagine the searching and the prayer that	lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service	to this majestic church.	3.4382495444349814
4746. such a church needs vigor and vitality	in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments	he told his members.	5.71461045417375
4747. a minister should not stay beyond the	time that his leadership should benefit his church he wrote h	for he becomes ordinary h.	3.266884442709933
4748. and so the young minister	resigned to go and study and pray having never passed a day he	told his parishioners when i did not gain from you far more than	i ever gave to you.	5.134208006450743
4749. his very honest act called up the recent	talk i had with another minister a modest methodist who said:	i feel so deeply blessed by god when i can give a message of love	and comfort to other men and i would have it no other way: and	it is unworthy to think of self.	3.333181569226185
4750. but oh how i do sometimes need just	a moment of rest and peace in myself.	5.696542874651629
4751. a man who gives	himself to god and to the believers of his church takes upon himself	a life of giving.	4.16805775149709
4752. he does not expect to get great riches or he would	not have chosen to answer the call to preach.	5.894536718509852
4753. the good ones are not	motivated to seek vainly nor are they disposed to covet comfort or they	would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity.	3.0550674352279263
4754. theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards.	6.22078893656577
4755. yet we who	lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation	of the infinite through him- we who readily accept his sacrifice	as our due we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is	in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul.	3.620993099384278
4756. we press	him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions	with his word and god's.	5.3244150359659645
4757. we do not defeat the good ones	with this cruelty but we add to their burden while expecting them	to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance	and a few bucks a week american cash.	3.3419309839161704
4758. if we break the minister	to our bit we are buying back our own sins.	5.912426921869693
4759. if he won't break we	add to the stress he bears.	4.60893662528027
4760. and a minister of all men is most	conscious that he is mere man- prone to the stresses that earthly	humanity is heir to.	5.683940708001811
4761. we expect him to be noble and to make us so-	yet he knows and tries to tell us how very humble man must be.	4.0752460284161875
4762. we expect bestowal of god's love through him.	6.7161243145723635
4763. but how little love	we give him.	5.149289017956558
4764. the church truly is not a rest home for saints but a	hospital for sinners.	5.774149500159434
4765. yet every sunday we sinners go to that emergency	room to receive first aid and we leave unmindful that the man who	ministered to us is a human being who suffers too.	3.519138914083065
4766. mr podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each	summer at loon lake.	5.939689995991661
4767. the narrow fringe of sadness that ran around	it only emphasized the pleasure.	3.1854515389204408
4768. the evening was not always	spent in the same way.	6.586920253114477
4769. this year on a night cool with the front of september	moving in but with plenty of summer still about the podgers	were holding a neighborhood gathering in the pod.	3.6562656655326085
4770. the little cottage	was bursting with people of all ages.	5.817864340166415
4771. in the midst of it all	mr podger came out on the pod porch alone.	4.480225069866018
4772. he had that day	attended a country auction and he had come back with a prize.	7.0527790005125635
4773. the prize was an old-fashioned woven cloth hammock complete with cross-top	pillow fringed side pieces and hooks for hanging.	3.0035870664622424
4774. mrs podger	had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for	it and there it was slung in a vine-shaded corner the night breeze	rippling its fringe with a slow caressing movement.	4.895368937909061
4775. mr	podger sat down in it pushed himself back and forth in one or two	slow rhythmic motions and then swung his feet up into it.	3.582994418514298
4776. he closed	his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly	over him.	5.592266232634282
4777. suddenly one young voice rose above the others.	4.563413411429909
4778. but	it said do you always know when you're happy?	6.497793678716987
4779. 	the voice sank back into the general tangle of sound but the question	stayed in mr podger's mind.	3.6041431794584815
4780. here in the cool autumn-touched	evening mr podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly	contented and at peace.	5.82414683096034
4781. it had begun with the blue jay	feather.	5.908040381423324
4782. walking along the lake before breakfast mr podger had	seen the feather and the bird that had lost it in flight.	5.184751330086269
4783. the winging	spread of blue had gone on calling harshly into the wood.	3.4216729860505777
4784. the	small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet.	5.828248383286981
4785. all	day long mr podger who was a straw-hat man in the summer had	worn	the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield.	3.7587760141988413
4786. would a blue	feather in a man's hat make him happy all day?	5.994594008566495
4787.  hardly.	7.781497302878112
4788. but it	was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning	sunshine linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by	the lake.	5.562207056137002
4789. then since the auction was being held nearby he had	walked to it.	3.957676123664819
4790. and there on the way had been the box turtle that	slow self-contained world-ignoring relic of pre-history bent for	reasons best known to itself on crossing the road.	5.549140590547675
4791. it was doing very	well too having reached the center and was pursuing its way with commendable	singleness of purpose when mr podger saw hazard approaching	in the shape of a flashy little sports car.	3.326932582087183
4792. would the driver see	the turtle?	8.765951937458983
4793.  would he take pains to avoid it?	5.10666707450836
4794.    mr podger	took no chances.	8.146593118617925
4795. taking off his hat and signaling the driver with	it mr podger stepped into the road lifted the surprised turtle	and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking	suddenness.	3.5225014798996317
4796. the turtle immediately withdrew into its private	council room to study the phenomenon.	5.1383222494817025
4797. but mr podger and the	driver of the sports car waved at each other.	4.131626532122669
4798. here in the cool darkness	mr podger could still feel the warmth of midday could still	see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road could still see the	friendly grin on the young sun-browned face as the driver looked back	over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight.	4.842193179578523
4799. where was the driver now?	6.1723286655965675
4800.  what was he doing?	10.195425673254634
4801.  and the turtle?	7.229560056019047
4802. 	mr podger smiled.	7.9068494396104985
4803. for a few brief minutes they had all been	part of one little drama.	4.6674990643474645
4804. the three would never meet again but for	some reason or other mr podger was sure he would always remember	the incident.	4.9158767420233955
4805. then there had been the auction itself.	6.7327782311814355
4806. mr	podger heard again at will the voice of the auctioneer the voices	of the bidders and finally the small boy who had been so interested	in mr podger's hammock purchase.	5.240755587932927
4807. i like them things	too he had said.	5.255342971340968
4808. we got one at home.	8.613205309230189
4809. you know what?	8.07995729795247
4810.  if	you're lyin' out in the hammock at night and it gets kinda cool-	you know- you just take these sides with the fringe on- see-	and wrap 'em right over you.	4.943096493802256
4811. i do it lots o' times- i like to	lie in a hammock at night by myself when it's all quiet.	3.6848655532977124
4812. h the	wind moves it a little bit- you know h.	6.597955707115865
4813. mr podger	had	thanked him gravely and now he made use of the advice.	4.661618697851529
4814. as he pulled	the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon mr podger	saw that thin attractive freckled little face again and hoped that	the boy too was lying in a cool fringed-wrapped quiet.	4.827420046935648
4815. alacrity	the podger cat came by the hammock rubbed her back briefly	against it and then sure of a welcome hopped up.	3.4309467023565854
4816. she remarked that	she found the night wind a little chilly and mr podger took her	inside the fringe.	5.3374200822229145
4817. soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree	crickets rivaled the hum of voices from inside the pod.	3.4324055910637687
4818. mr	podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen	door opened and pam burst out.	6.06126953788045
4819. it's	getting so chilly we've lighted a fire and we're going to tell	a round robin story- a nice scary one.	3.1122226624738567
4820. we need you to start it.	8.42550825901505
4821. why	are you out here all by yourself?	4.310997698274464
4822.  aren't you happy?	8.372310913027198
4823. 	mr podger opened his cocoon and emerged tucking alacrity under	his arm to bring her in by the fire.	3.361342684501805
4824. of course i am he said.	8.812169056151928
4825. never happier in my life.	5.390818343379241
4826. i just came out here to know it.	7.694884065646533
4827. as the south begins another school year national and even	world	attention is directed at the region's slow progress toward racial	equality in the public schools.	3.6295564821987965
4828. desegregation is beginning in	two more important southern cities- dallas and atlanta.	5.6059307059672525
4829. in each	city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public	opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment.	3.765757741403661
4830. these programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully.	6.651250395638094
4831. the programs do not take sides on the issue itself.	3.799660802523975
4832. they point	out simply that it is the law of the land.	9.185692427531707
4833. the two	cities have the examples of little rock and new orleans to hold up	as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes	of desegregation.	3.3792767615417176
4834. even better they have the examples of nashville	and houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs.	6.004816913025755
4835. in each case there was an initial act of violence.	5.016849065491641
4836. in nashville a	school was dynamited.	7.1305330047353275
4837. in houston there were a few incidents of friction	between whites and negroes none of which were serious.	3.8544733446847284
4838. in	each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government	halted the threats of more serious incidents.	5.184659927964864
4839. the nashville	plan incidentally has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable	and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled south.	3.3492676052719315
4840. it is a stair-step plan in which desegregation begins in	the first grade.	6.030923020909523
4841. each year another grade is added to the process until	finally all 12 grades are integrated.	4.222639652384615
4842. the schedules are flexible	so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant	or realizes that it is something that has to be done so why	not now.	5.540570199552072
4843. the program has worked well in both nashville and	houston.	4.30624181866322
4844. it met a serious rebuff in new orleans where the two schools	selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by	white parents.	5.899193311854379
4845. another attempt will be made this year in new orleans	to resume the program.	4.143038383765946
4846. generally throughout the south	there is a	growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every	step of desegregation is met.	5.479141046317224
4847. perhaps the most eloquent move	toward removal of racial barriers has been in dallas.	4.671820141848539
4848. during the summer	negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants	and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments.	5.270454917464544
4849. it was part	of a citywide move toward full integration.	4.151143456019851
4850. so successful has	been this program worked out by white and negro civic leaders that	further extensions are expected in the next few months.	5.640908083677302
4851. hotels for	example are ready to let down the bars.	4.382430210358794
4852. already at least one hotel	has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis.	6.2880322401375315
4853. several conventions	have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated	basis.	4.454688132637502
4854. this is a radical change in attitude from the conditions	which prevailed several years ago when a series of bombings was directed	against negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods	of dallas.	5.419513558674997
4855. it is also symptomatic of a change in attitude	which appears to be spreading all across the south.	4.398929216669491
4856. southern	whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence	to try to stop negroes from claiming equal rights.	5.682298991943981
4857. they insist	they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in alabama	when the freedom riders sought to break down racial discrimination	in local bus depots.	3.331148558910114
4858. all across the south there are signs	that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves	would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant	attitude toward it.	4.809007050469228
4859. there are many causes for this change.	5.503117020796436
4860. one	of the most important is economic.	8.885544438669635
4861. business leaders are aware now	that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence.	3.7384110018302117
4862. they are putting	strong pressure on their police departments to keep order.	6.230594629537289
4863. in the	past these same southerners were inclined to look the other way.	4.218694738177624
4864. and as the businessmen have begun to act a real sense of	co-operation	has sprung up.	6.6364112581273345
4865. this co-operation has emboldened other southern whites	to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation.	3.322473116358526
4866. they	realize that by acting in concert rather than individually they will	not be picked out as objects of retaliation- economic and	otherwise.	4.9294278934869915
4867. since moving from a chicago suburb to southern california a	few months ago i've been introduced to a new game called lanesmanship.	3.9219529491900267
4868. played mostly on the freeways around los angeles it goes like	this:   a driver cruising easily at 70 mph in lane	a of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead.	4.498668967350279
4869. traffic	in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes	a tentative fender into lane b which is heavily populated by cars	also moving at 70 mph.	3.1740780651099505
4870. the adjacent driver in lane	b has three choices open to him.	4.918130688477006
4871. he can point his car resolutely	at the invading fender and force the other driver back into lane	a; slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes;	or alternately accelerate and decelerate thus keeping the	first driver guessing as to his intentions thereby making a fascinating	sport of the whole affair.	3.1405663852799552
4872. the really remarkable thing to	me is that most california natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down	and permit the invading car free access.	4.571096235541263
4873. whether or not this is done	out of enlightened self-preservation i don't know.	4.169655854715823
4874. but it is done	consistently and i'm both surprised and impressed.	6.682468826263
4875. this	could never happen in my native chicago.	4.187335525119484
4876. there such soggy acquiesence	would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood.	6.00158410632472
4877. in	chicago the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor	in an effort to force the other car back.	3.5439768633737563
4878. failing this he would pull	alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly.	5.761939477391639
4879. this negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways however	does an injustice to southern california drivers.	3.6202351446059198
4880. at the risk	of losing my charge-a-plate at marshall field and company i would	like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype.	5.218164642186178
4881. after three months	of research i can state unequivocally that los angeles drivers are	considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers i've	ever encountered.	3.451453682898076
4882. during one recent day of driving about los	angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers	stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible	side street.	5.27931417460945
4883. an out-of-town writer came up to paul	richards today and asked the oriole manager if he thought his ball	club would be improved this year.	3.5344417592624917
4884. now richards of course is	known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go.	5.751508190579781
4885. he can often make the	complex ridiculously simple and vice versa.	4.313216532824485
4886. this happened to be	vice versa but even so the answer	was a masterpiece.	6.054245362363131
4887. it's a whole lot easier he said	to increase the population of nevada than it is to increase the	population of new york city.	4.29200110622754
4888. and with that he walked off to give	instruction to a rookie pitcher.	6.610688297611701
4889. that is undoubtedly a hell	of a quote said the writer scratching his head.	4.011822335237052
4890. now if i	can just figure out what he's talking about i'll use it.	5.816198471163717
4891. spots open	this was just richard's way of saying that last	year the birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open.	3.5664037841188954
4892. some brilliant rookies nailed them down so that this spring just two	spots left and right field are really up for grabs.	5.533616306719585
4893. it should	be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots	that were open last year but so far it hasn't worked that way.	3.965711110307718
4894. this angle of just where the orioles can look for improvement this	year is an interesting one.	5.796895890863451
4895. you'd never guess it from the way they've	played so far this spring but there remains a feeling among some	around here that the orioles still have a chance to battle for the	pennant in 1961.	3.6359713039599098
4896. obviously if this club is going to move from	second to first in the american league it will have to show improvement	someplace.	7.444211278755988
4897. where can that improvement possibly come from?	4.916780719109557
4898. 	you certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than	it did last year.	5.249111103415458
4899. brooks robinson is great	and it is conceivable that he'll do even better in 1961 than he	did in 1960.	3.6105544945815518
4900. you can't expect it though.	8.751699788417616
4901. robby's performance last	year was tremendous.	4.543083147510349
4902. it's the same with ron hansen and	jim gentile.	6.800883177381819
4903. if they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no	complaint.	5.78016024333555
4904. they shouldn't be asked to carry any more of the burden.	6.868809425644118
4905. hansen will be getting a late spring training start which might	very well set him back.	3.686715407867395
4906. he got off to an exceptional start last season	and under the circumstances probably won't duplicate it.	5.61395759056176
4907. there are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching	to him last year.	3.97434663757648
4908. they don't expect to stop him just slow him	down some with the bat.	5.816826404169406
4909. he'll still be a top player they concede	because he's got a great glove and the long ball going for him.	3.503459102190975
4910. but	they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production.	6.33984063414542
4911. might move up	gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs.	3.759059477858703
4912. i have a hunch marv breeding might move	up a notch.	6.612243113879909
4913. but even so he had a good year in 1960 and won't do	too much better.	4.76564362828948
4914. so all in all the infield can't be expected	to supply the added improvement to propel the birds from second	to first.	5.965537383270811
4915. and the pitching will also have trouble doing better.	4.6456615333728255
4916. richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and	experience last season.	5.910147770433807
4917. where then can we look for improvement?	5.405384108635292
4918. 	from triandos brandt and walker answers richards.	5.912888603624434
4919. they're the ones we can expect to do better.	4.249230322943968
4920. the	man is right and at this time indications are that these three are	ready for better seasons.	6.103496558220384
4921. triandos hasn't proved it yet but	he says he's convinced his thumb is all right.	3.3851119961818994
4922. he jammed it this	spring and has had to rest it but he says the old injury hasn't bothered	him.	5.81266649629449
4923. if he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years	the club will have to be better off offensively.	5.186717410136228
4924. i'm still	not convinced though i'll have to see more of him before predicting	that big year for him.	5.482923488789415
4925. hank foiles backed up by frank house	who will be within calling distance in the minors make up better second	line catching than the birds had all last year but gus is still	that big man you need when you start talking pennant.	3.0984977751152787
4926. to me	brandt	looks as though he could be in for a fine year.	7.543198464501175
4927. he hasn't played	too much because richards has been working on him furiously in batting	practice.	3.879486827102106
4928. he's hitting the ball hard in the batting cage and	his whole attitude is improved over this time last year.	4.889832230052407
4929. when	he came to baltimore he was leaving a team which was supposed to win	the national league pennant and he was joining what seemed to be	a second division american league club.	3.5452993806004005
4930. he was down hard to talk	to	and far too nonchalant on the field.	6.010572466609162
4931. as of now that all seems behind	him.	5.591955732103251
4932. he's been entirely different all spring.	6.540375738893324
4933. and walker	looks stronger seems to be throwing better than he did last year.	4.473193524002477
4934. let	him bounce back and he could really set up the staff.	6.426291734479256
4935. so	if the orioles are to improve brandt triandos and walker will have	to do it.	3.638661731627009
4936. so far the platoons on left and right fielders don't	seem capable of carrying the load.	5.937115386082972
4937. of course this isn't	taking into consideration the population of nevada and new york	city but it's the way things look from here at this point.	3.549855198448663
4938. is the mother of an autistic child at fault?	8.10614042560225
4939. 	child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self.	4.072960151218301
4940. he tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects-	did his	mother make him this way?	6.241723231549461
4941.    some people believe she did.	5.878141490051111
4942. we believe that autism like so many other conditions	of defect and deviation is to a large extent inborn.	6.065361405585161
4943. a mother	can help a child adapt to his difficulties.	3.8650728943590416
4944. sometimes she	can- to a large extent- help him overcome them.	6.935722166417405
4945. but we don't think	she creates them.	5.183789600399308
4946. we don't think she can make her child defective	emotionally disturbed or autistic.	5.860909604848057
4947. the mother of a difficult	child can do a great deal to help her own child and often by sharing	her experiences she can help other mothers with the same problem.	3.6038986792693226
4948. since little is known about autism and almost nothing has been written	for the layman we'd like to share one experienced mother's comments.	5.246338027820374
4949. she wrote:	as the mother of an autistic	child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything	i have to manipulate my son's fingers for him when he	first	plays with a new toy.	3.45771501486837
4950. he wants me to do everything for him.	7.1899409147577416
4951. you	don't believe that autistic children become autistic because of	something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats	them.	3.9640584521281617
4952. but i do and my psychiatrist does too.	7.888236645670941
4953. i know that my	son wants control and direction but being autistic myself i cannot give	full control or direction.	3.705075793708015
4954. one thing i notice which i	have seldom heard mentioned.	7.025150579847689
4955. this is that autistic people don't enjoy	physical contact with others- for instance my children and i.	3.9461080052836914
4956. when i hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is	as straight and stiff as a board.	5.2478751631425915
4957. he pushes and straightens himself	as if he can't stand the feeling of being held.	3.7049703278112305
4958. physical contact is	uncomforatble for him!   this mother is quite correct.	5.765218264010608
4959. as	a rule the autistic child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others.	3.7065821538528234
4960. parents have to find other ways of comforting him.	6.864907007773176
4961. for the young	child this may be no more than providing food light or movement.	4.963945126660052
4962. as	he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object	.	7.061460454674952
4963. or certain words or rituals that child and	adult go through may do the trick.	3.838516579287946
4964. the answer is different for each autistic	child but for most there is an answer.	6.03479128014023
4965. only ingenuity will uncover	it.	6.0425455931307495
4966. dear doctors: we learned this	year that our older son daniel is autistic.	5.281491791179018
4967. we did not accept the	diagnosis at once but gradually we are coming to.	4.329288555767465
4968. fortunately there	is a nursery school which he has been able to attend with a group	of normal children.	6.996326260308485
4969. i try to treat daniel as if he were normal	though of course i realize he is far from that at present.	4.473195607363044
4970. what	i do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible.	7.4368874256534365
4971. i try to give him as many normal experiences as possible.	4.545698473423799
4972. what is your experience with autistic children?	7.947770246414763
4973.  how do they	turn out later?	5.768450398499045
4974.    many autistic children grow up to lead	relatively normal lives.	6.899353608140796
4975. certainly most continue to lack a certain warmth	in communication with other people but many adjust to school even	college to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood.	3.5836000630197455
4976. use	- a first grader colors pictures one solid color	everything- sky grass boy wagon etc.	4.950047401300498
4977. when different colors	are used she is just as likely to color trees purple hair green	etc.	4.126184201189658
4978. the other children in the class use this same coloring	book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color.	5.709376685062277
4979. should	i show my daughter how things should be colored?	3.872470671116009
4980.  she is an aggressive	nervous child.	8.940539453119941
4981. is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help	her outgrow these traits?	4.249154901358736
4982.  - her choice of one color	means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring without having	reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects.	4.9266698950186845
4983. this immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature	for the first grade.	4.105237940909267
4984. no coloring isn't exactly something	you teach a child.	6.26187174132527
4985. you sometimes give them a little demonstration	a little guidance and suggestions about staying inside the lines.	3.8964193675714047
4986. but	most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only	a very little demonstration.	5.9170500192922795
4987. seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest	in an old art: embroidery.	3.5801989772569325
4988. possibly responsible for this is the incoming	trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms which seems slated to	replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed.	5.899411639748965
4989. just as	a varitinted oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme	so may some of the newest versions of embroidery.	3.9022947552868077
4990. one such	in fact is a rug.	7.726008244239285
4991. though not actually crewel embroidery it has	that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue pink bronze	and gold and a sauterne background.	3.3647888754353534
4992. the twirled stylized design of	winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns	used so extensively for upholstery during the jacobean period in	england.	4.110625859725427
4993. traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing	more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available	in this country.	4.274324495713913
4994. the work is executed in england and	can be worked in any desired design and color.	5.53157267991933
4995. among some recent	imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on	which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens	and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color.	3.0942056126646382
4996. for a particularly fabulous room which houses	a collection of fine english chippendale furniture fabric wall panels	were embroidered with a typically chinese-inspired design of this	revered eighteenth century period.	4.761392848902308
4997. since the work is done by hand	the only limitation it is said is that of human conception.	5.033957578606341
4998. modern embroidered panels framed and meant to be hung on the	wall are another aspect of this trend.	5.67682206718088
4999. these have never gone out of	style in scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and	there in shops which specialize in handicrafts.	3.4859982920397576
5000. an amateur decorator	might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings and by	picking up her living room color scheme add a decorative do-it-yourself	note to the room.	4.800622802944936
5001. california democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962	model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling	in a thousand district headquarters party clubrooms and workers'	backyards.	3.245910248496181
5002. they seem darned proud of it.	7.140314491124691
5003. and they're	confident that the gop currently assailed by dissensions	within the ranks will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood	of this grassroots-fueled machine.	3.331142579951835
5004. their meeting at san	francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the california	democratic council directorate.	5.714059056854414
5005. but it will include 200-odd officeholders	organization leaders and interested party people.	4.678231761400618
5006. out of this session may come: - plans for a dramatic	broad-scale party rally in los angeles next december that would enlist	top-drawer democrats from all over the country.	5.608623525136599
5007. blueprints	for doubling the cdc's present 55000 enrollment.	3.978165740589449
5008. arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in	fresno next jan 26-28.	5.482703643302981
5009. and proposals for a whole series	of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state's 38 new congressional	districts.	3.766973064420842
5010. at the head of the cdc is an unorthodox	39-year-old amateur politico thomas b carvey jr	whose normal profession is helping develop hughes aircraft's moon	missiles.	5.325337746950534
5011. he's approached his democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering	fashion.	3.8380454074799544
5012. viewed from afar the cdc looks like	a rather stalwart political pyramid: its elected directorate fans out	into an array of district leaders and standing committees and thence	into its component clubs and affiliated groups- 500 or so.	4.214995447723725
5013. much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every	volunteer democratic organization of any consequence belongs to	the cdc.	4.0495657605041355
5014. moreover the entire state democratic hierarchy	from gov brown on down to the county chairmen also participates	in this huge operation.	5.722634948516333
5015. contrarily republican volunteers	go their separate ways and thus far have given no indication	that they'd be willing to join forces under a single directorate	except in the most loose-knit fashion.	3.511611405281181
5016. carvey believes that	reapportionment	which left many democratic clubs split by these new district	boundaries actually will increase cdc membership.	4.980686074074009
5017. where	only one club existed before he says two will flourish henceforth.	3.737625909216291
5018. biggest organizational problem he adds is setting up cdc	units in rock-ribbed democratic territory.	5.06307510518198
5019. paradoxically the council	is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party's	favor strongest where democrats and republicans compete on a fairly	even basis.	3.1534062861661236
5020. like most democratic spokesmen carvey predicts	1962 will be a tremendously partisan year.	6.444879719231699
5021. hence the attention	they're lavishing on the cdc.	4.663051570029926
5022. in all probability the	council will screen and endorse candidates for the assembly and for	congress and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary	favorites.	5.1553193572970075
5023. this bodes heated contests in several districts where	claims have already been staked out by democratic hopefuls who don't	see eye-to-eye with the cdc.	3.1919421812369326
5024. naturally the statewide	races will provide the major test for the expanding council.	6.3253882022564145
5025. shunted	aside by the rampant organizers for john f kennedy last	year who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the presidential	campaign the cdc plainly intends to provide the party's	campaign muscle in 1962.	3.452666946831256
5026. there is evidence that it will be happily received	by gov brown and the other constitutional incumbents.	7.43271657927254
5027. carvey considers that former vice president nixon would be brown's	most formidable foe with ex-gov knight a close second.	3.3983379747686175
5028. but the rest of the gop gubernatorial aspirants don't worry	him very much.	6.369697698302393
5029. in his cdc work carvey has the close-in	support and advice of one of california's shrewdest political strategists:	former democratic national committeeman paul ziffren	who backed him over a northland candidate espoused by atty gen	stanley mosk.	3.164383600648708
5030. that saw mosk moving into the national committee post over ziffren	note: we've	just received an announcement of the 54th assembly district post-reapportionment	organizing convention wednesday night in south	pasadena's war memorial bldg which graphically illustrates the	cdc's broad appeal.	4.655363399507156
5031. state sen dick richards will keynote;	state and county	committeemen cdc directors and representatives	members of 16 area clubs and all residents have been invited.	3.3911213116948127
5032. this is going to be a language lesson and you can master it in	a few minutes.	7.372874082966459
5033. it is a short course in communese.	5.095480374681948
5034. it works	with english russian german hungarian or almost any other foreign	tongue.	5.970647442429147
5035. once you learn how to translate communese much of each	day's deluge of news will become clearer.	3.9023892626507064
5036. at least i have found it	so.	10.176631174965054
5037. for some compulsive reason which would have fascinated	dr freud communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably	impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves.	3.488358905124822
5038. they	accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves	are most guilty.	5.5917115517889835
5039. president kennedy's latest warning to the	communist world that the united states will build up its military	strength to meet any challenge in berlin or elsewhere was somewhat surprisingly	reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the	iron curtain.	3.330892575129866
5040. then the communese reply came back from many mouthpieces	with striking consistency.	6.415630977465612
5041. now listen closely:	moscow radio from the literary gazette in english to england:	president kennedy once again interpreted the soviet proposals	to sign a peace treaty with germany as a threat as part of	the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism.	3.2867120956087748
5042. evidently	the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred	up in the west have been planned long in advance.	5.162451435507919
5043. the west berlin	crisis is being played up artificially because it is needed by the	united states to justify its arms drive.	3.7807667865841617
5044. the soviet news	agency tass datelined from new york in english to europe:	president kennedy's enlargement of the american military	program was welcomed on wall street as a stimulus to the american	munitions industry.	5.361855558520828
5045. when the stock exchange opened this morning	many dealers were quick to purchase shares in douglas lockheed and	united aircraft and prices rose substantially.	3.3605522286503775
5046. over 4 million shares	were sold the highest figures since early june.	6.007366707636165
5047. tass datelined los angeles in english to europe:	former vice president nixon came out in support of	president kennedy's program for stepping up the arms race.	3.5066003883189705
5048. he also	demanded that kennedy take additional measures to increase international	tension: specifically to crush the cuban revolution resume	nuclear testing resist more vigorously admission of china to its lawful	seat in the united nations and postpone non-military programs at	home.	4.932018174603597
5049. tass from moscow in english to europe:	the american press clamored for many days promising president	kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems	confronting the united states.	3.4662654934283856
5050. in fact the world heard nothing	but sabre-rattling the same exercises which proved futile for the	predecessors of the current president.	5.766002936671902
5051. if there were no west berlin	problem imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping	up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems	besetting the united states and its nato partners.	3.9517381526596207
5052. washington	apparently decided to use an old formula by injecting large	military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the us economy	after a prolonged slump.	5.25583928905752
5053. and now for communist	listeners and readers:   moscow radio in russian to the ussr:	the us president has shown once again that	the united states needs the fanning of the west berlin crisis	to justify the armaments race.	3.3983269657716595
5054. as was to be expected kennedy's latest	speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in bonn	where officials of the west german government praised it.	5.851939709750318
5055. moscow novosti article in russian datelined london:	us pressure on britain to foster war hysteria over the status	of west berlin has reached its apogee.	3.3030850585740503
5056. british common sense is	proverbial.	8.699905770298205
5057. the present attempts of the politicians to contaminate	ordinary britons shows that this british common sense is unwilling to	pull somebody else's chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures.	3.311173236591544
5058. east berlin radio in german to germany:	a better position for negotiations is the real point	of this speech.	5.3624434354908
5059. kennedy knows the west will not wage war for west	berlin neither conventional nor nuclear and negotiations will come	as certainly as the peace treaty.	3.3394274632611216
5060. whenever some washington circles	were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always	succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the pentagon and in bonn.	5.111755743852753
5061. in kennedy's speech are cross currents sensible ones and senseless	ones reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the president's	advisers and the political and economic forces behind them.	3.291571247725712
5062. well dear listeners despite all the shouting there will be no war	over west berlin.	6.647531985131563
5063. moscow tass in russian datelined	sochi:   chairman khrushchev received the us president's	disarmament adviser john mccloy.	3.5790387153848155
5064. their conversation	and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere.	6.266501735071757
5065. now	to translate from the communese this means:   the west berlin	crisis is really an east berlin crisis.	3.628163665740293
5066. the crisis	was artificially stirred up by the kremlin and the	red army.	5.350776258857228
5067. the reason was to speed up domestic production in the ussr	which khrushchev promised upon grabbing power and try to end	the permanent recession in russian living standards.	3.1430220520664935
5068. chairman	khrushchev in order to cure	his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position.	5.954097758410677
5069. his advisers	in the politburo are engaged in a great struggle	of opinions so he is not always consistent.	4.345561127239674
5070. the soviet union	will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over berlin	and neither will its warsaw pact allies.	5.087136054239606
5071. the west has no intention	of attacking russia.	3.9967133306105467
5072. chairman khrushchev and john mccloy	had a terrible row at sochi.	6.00671420940845
5073. see communese is easy- once	you get onto it.	4.291602230574483
5074. aug 4 1821 nearly a century after benjamin franklin founded	the pennsylvania gazette- a century during which it had undergone	several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication-	this paper made its first appearance as the saturday evening	post.	4.7393485771257975
5075. the country was now full of gazettes and samuel c atkinson	and charles alexander who had just taken over franklin's	old paper desired a more distinctive name.	3.0676798279742337
5076. when founded by franklin	the gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name	its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually	contained more and more fiction poetry and literary essays.	5.0885455086947164
5077. in the	middle of the century with a circulation of 90000 the post was one	of the most popular weeklies in the country.	4.028867799554334
5078. but during the second half	of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 cyrus	h k curtis purchased it- paper type and all-	for $1000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and	initialed miscellany and with only some 2000 subscribers.	4.729856011914084
5079. little	more than a fine old name valuable principally because of the	franklin tradition the saturday evening post was slow to revive.	3.5178789182121455
5080. but curtis poured over $1 million into it and in time it again became	one of the most popular weeklies of the country.	5.746625866121659
5081. remember the french railroad baron who was going to take me	floating down the nile?	4.415121450469498
5082.  h remember the night will rogers	filled a tooth for me between numbers?	6.088573343261978
5083.  h sure we met a	barrel of rich men but it's hard to find the real thing when you're	young beautiful and the toast of two continents h remember	fanny brice promised my mother she would look after me on the road?	3.5193079327271866
5084. 	all this remembering took place the other night when i	had supper with the ziegfeld girls at the beverly hills club.	5.409089756677182
5085. a quarter of a century has gone by since this bevy of walking dreams	sashayed up and down the staircases of the old new amsterdam theater	ny.	3.7097193986642196
5086. but watching mrs cyril ring berniece dalton	janssen mrs robert jarvis mrs walter adams order low-calory	seafood no bread i could see the ziegfeld girls of 1920	were determined to be glamorous grandmothers of 1961.	4.672644089390515
5087. i was	anxious to hear about those dazzling days on the great white way.	4.136640818275916
5088. all	i could remember was billie dove pasted over the ceiling of my	big brother's room.	4.967303163126196
5089. billie was really beautiful! exclaimed	vera forbes adams batting lovely big eyes behind glitter rimmed	glasses.	3.2541148766969448
5090. sing sing's prisoner strike was motivated by a reasonable	purpose a fair break from parole boards.	4.986506890979128
5091. but once the strike trend	hits hoosegows there is no telling how far it may go.	4.468450761747174
5092. inmates might	even demand the 34-hour week all holidays off and fringe benefits including	state contributions toward lawyers' fees.	4.760332783592175

5132. the 350th anniversary of the king james bible is being	celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the new testament	the first part of the new english bible undertaken as a new	translation of the scriptures into contemporary english.	5.492662824863408
5133. since	it was issued in the spring of 1611 the king james version has	been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations	of the bible.	3.481984974560952
5134. however biblical scholars frequently attested	to its numerous inaccuracies as old manuscripts were uncovered	and scholarship advanced.	5.17892547415895
5135. this resulted in revisions of the king	james bible in 1881-85 as the english revised version and in	1901 as the american standard version.	3.4004806117293587
5136. then in 1937 america's	international council of religious education authorized a new revision	in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages.	5.514690394374586
5137. undertaken by 32 american scholars under the chairmanship	of rev dr luther a weigle former dean of yale university	divinity school their studies resulted in the publishing of the	revised standard version 1946-52.	3.038391664476121
5138. the new english	bible	has not been planned to rival or replace the king james	version but as its cover states it is offered simply as the bible	to all those who will use it in reading teaching or worship.	4.945941718384633
5139. time of course will testify whether the new version will have	achieved its purpose.	4.590089540018281
5140. bible reading even more so than good classical	music grows in depth and meaning upon repetition.	5.271692178249955
5141. if this	new bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout	the years it will not survive the ages as has the king james	version.	3.7581270594006253
5142. however an initial perusal and comparison of some	of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to	speak well of the efforts of the british biblical scholars.	5.680056548425122
5143. one is	impressed with the dignity clarity and beauty of this new translation	into contemporary english and there is no doubt that the meaning of	the bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary	language than in the frequently	archaic words and phrases of the	king james.	3.833483261761273
5144. for example in the third chapter of matthew verses	13-16 describing the baptism of jesus the 1611 version reads:	then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john	to be baptized of him.	4.96587081425961
5145. but john forbad him saying i have	need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me?	3.696182443495304
5146.    and	jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now: for thus it	becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.	5.284653998619184
5147. and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the	water: and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit	of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him.	3.4320067895119895
5148. meaning	certainly the meaning is clearer to one who is not	familiar with biblical teachings in the new english bible which reads:	then jesus arrived at jordan from galilee and he came	to john to be baptized by him.	5.101919995810617
5149. john tried to dissuade him.	5.566239668376932
5150. 'do you	come to me'?	7.2063624088082445
5151.  he said; 'i need rather to be baptized by you'.	4.178667878511904
5152. jesus replied 'let it be so for the present; we do well to	conform this way with all that god requires'.	5.7623700551389065
5153. john then allowed him	to come.	5.324969863500522
5154. after baptism jesus came up out of the water at once and	at that moment heaven opened; he saw the spirit of god descending	like a dove to alight upon him;	among the most frequently quoted biblical sentences are the beatitudes	and yet so few persons other than scholars really understand the	true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by jesus at the beginning	of the sermon on the mount.	4.793076373857627
5155. to illustrate the first blessing	in the king james bible reads: blessed are the poor in	spirit; for their's is the kingdom of heaven.	3.6793133122828654
5156. the new version	states: how blest are those who know that they are poor; the	kingdom of heaven is theirs.	6.043516485423273
5157. some of the poetic cadence of	the older version certainly is lost in the newer one but almost anyone	with a fair knowledge of the english language can understand the	meaning without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar.	3.620066856385575
5158. to a novice	that is significant.	8.215150649296177
5159. in the second and third	chapters of revelation the new version retains however the old phrase	angel of the church which biblical scholars have previously	interpreted as meaning bishop.	3.87456497139481
5160. this is not contemporary english.	9.292791083698058
5161. contemporary	for the most part however the new version is	contemporary and as such should be the means for many to attain a	clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds	of years ago by the first followers of christ.	3.7290778381481364
5162. originally	recorded by hand these words have been copied and recopied translated	and retranslated through the ages.	5.036930641829304
5163. discoveries recently made of	old biblical manuscripts in hebrew and greek and other ancient writings	some by the early church fathers in themselves called for a restudy	of the bible.	3.2627534592365537
5164. to have the results recorded in everyday usable	english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth.	6.447092769490579
5165. there	is one danger however.	6.134522882161843
5166. with contemporary english changing with the	rapidity that marks this jet age some of the words and phrases of the	new version may themselves soon become archaic.	5.493048474589853
5167. the only answer will	be continuous study.	4.503016183355296
5168. the new testament offered to the public	today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up	of representatives of the church of england church of scotland	methodist church congregational union baptist union presbyterian	church of england churches in wales churches in ireland	society of friends british and foreign bible society and national	society of scotland.	5.461990221676442

5274. his desires	are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother's	love for him and what she expects of him in order to overcome them.	5.52554344858679

5294. this is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities	and colleges schedule what they call homecoming day.	5.583033236554207
5295. they seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes.	4.645217642026084
5296. the football opponent on homecoming is of course selected with	the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a christian	when thrown to one of the emperor's lions.	5.130089756334451
5297. it is true of	course the uncertainties of life being what they are that as now and	then the christian killed the lion homecoming days have been ruined	by a visiting team.	3.5574650871643625
5298. even with all possible precaution homecomings	are usually rather cruel and sad and only the perpetually ebullient	and the continually optimistic are made happy by them.	5.071201433259769
5299. more	often than not as the old grad wanders along the old paths his	memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside	him becomes an ache and a pain.	3.4373833783058405
5300. he can smell again the perfume she	wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter and can smell again the	aroma of autumn- fallen leaves the wine of cool air and the nostalgia	of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall.	4.584753728687632
5301. it is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple	of undergraduates faces alight holding hands and talking happily	as they come along oblivious of him or throwing him the most fleeting	and casual of glances such as they would give a tethered goat.	3.176620754684461
5302. usually	they titter loudly after they have passed by.	6.455718619260481
5303. he feels suddenly the weight of the fat that is on him.	4.594158201095112
5304. his	bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous.	5.955845995411395
5305. his legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary as if he had	walked for miles instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the	old campus paths.	3.505289878976991
5306. bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is	like unripe persimmons in his mouth.	5.650958887839178
5307. it is not much better if	he meets with old classmates.	4.503826701128498
5308. too often unless he hails them they	pass him by.	6.474197544771861

5310. if they do meet and recognize one another slap backs and embrace	the moment soon is done.	5.765303913472049
5311. after all when one has asked whatever became	of old joe and charlie h when one has inquired who it was sue	brown married and where it is they now live h when questions are asked	and answered about families and children and old professors h when	the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted h that does	it.	3.372956497319907
5312. by then one begins to notice the middle-age	spread; the gray hairs the eyeglasses bodies that are too thin	or too heavy; the fading signs of old beauty; the athlete of by-gone	years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs	when he has finished a sentence	of any length h then it is time to break it up and move on.	4.516819617832364
5313. it is if anything worse on the old player h   he sits	in the stands and he doesn't like that.	3.71422509997558
5314. enough of his life was spent	there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator	in the crowd.	5.978731190182347
5315. a team feels something.	5.009950131604775
5316. on a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next	to him.	8.024111018776276
5317. in the stands he is lonely and lost no matter how many are about	him.	4.378021575262059
5318. he sits there remembering the tense moment before the	ball was snapped; the churning of straining feet the rasp of the	canvas pants; the smell and feel of hot wet woolen sleeves across his	face.	4.3138062496348235
5319. he remembers the desperate panting breath; the long runs	on the kick-offs; the hard jolting tackles; the breakthrough; the	desperate agony of goal-line stands.	3.0155845464801687
5320. and so he squirms with each	play remembering his youth.	6.576393010823162
5321. but it is no use.	7.632269222215555
5322. no matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and	strength they can never be recaptured again.	6.19485603059515
5323. since the obvious is not always true the republican national	committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that	it occurred as suspected in the larger cities.	3.4712324062668674
5324. of 40 cities	with populations of 300000 and more mr kennedy carried 26 and mr	nixon 14.	5.679517553283156
5325. there are eight states in which the largest urban vote	can be the balance of power in any close election.	4.304854387294757
5326. these are new	york pennsylvania michigan maryland missouri new jersey illinois	and minnesota.	5.991719074404112
5327. in 1952 mr eisenhower won all but missouri.	4.439062881786378
5328. yet in 1960 all eight gave majorities to mr kennedy.	6.61367845496657
5329. republican research broke down the vote in philadelphia.	4.550560376333335
5330. mr nixon	despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups failed	to do so.	5.768463067337519
5331. his visit to warsaw poland after the russian journey	in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the polish vote which	in several cities is substantial.	3.7164639619945
5332. yet the gop breakdown discovered	that in philadelphia mr nixon received but 21 per cent of	the so-called polish vote; 30 per cent of the irish vote	and 18 per cent of the negro vote.	6.0153855181736136
5333. a gop task force' committee will seek to find out how its	party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities.	3.5626950224087692
5334. the task force might make a start in washington with republican	congressional leaders.	5.80176860891379
5335. these gentlemen already have done the party	harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas	and by their criticism of mr kennedy for talking about a recession	and unemployment.	3.440134486544343
5336. this error was compounded by declaring the recession	to be a statistical one and not a reality.	5.648406787732617
5337. the almost six	million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do	not consider themselves and their plight as statistical.	3.2756584776517097
5338. they did not	view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by secretary of labor	goldberg as politics which the gop declared it to be.	5.321563683950719
5339. the	people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take	an interest in their misery.	4.063386431946802
5340. senator mundt's gross distortion	of president eisenhower's conversation into a denunciation	of president kennedy as too left wing a statement mr eisenhower	declared to be entirely false is another case in point.	4.705797695628838
5341. if the republicans	and southern democrats join to defeat medical care for the	old under the social security program they will thereby erect still	another barrier to gop hopes in the cities.	3.3332561253294584
5342. the present republican leadership as practiced by mundt goldwater	bridges dirksen et al is repeating the errors of the party	leadership of the 1930s.	4.855876213700074
5343. in that decade the partisan zeal to defend mr	hoover and the party's failure to anticipate or cope with the	depression caused a great majority of americans to see the republican	party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human	beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic	crash.	3.50932798036882
5344. the republican party was not lacking in humanity	but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear	devoid of any consideration for people in trouble.	4.954450523070567
5345. farmers called their	mule-drawn pickup trucks hoover carts.	4.35543180209916
5346. smokers reduced to	the makings spoke of the sack tobacco as hoover dust.	5.424573167733594
5347. one may be sure the present republican congressional leadership	hasn't meant to repeat this error.	4.306835303691397
5348. but it is in the process of so	doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade john	f kennedy.	6.833242306194113
5349. that this is not good politics is underscored by the	latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like	the way in which the new president is conducting the nation's business.	4.591083651244195
5350. the most articulate republicans are those who in their	desire to get back at mr kennedy already have created the image	of a republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed	and the unemployed and which is even more unwilling to help old people	who need medical care.	4.835283921317584
5351. if they also defeat the school bill the	gop task force won't have much research to do.	3.8675501950389406
5352. it will early	know why the party won't win back city votes.	6.498124641414178
5353. the 1962 general assembly has important business to consider.	3.5389910986233617
5354. the tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in	any responsible manner.	6.689831259156584
5355. after the griffin-byrd political troup	has completed the circuit in november in the name of a pre-legislative	forum this is going to be the most politically oriented legislature	in history.	4.221410724146699
5356. every legislator from brasstown bald to	folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny	as a test of his political allegiances not his convictions.	5.515051456205681
5357. hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system	stands less chance than ever.	3.632947819985911
5358. and just how far can the legislature	go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the	midst of a governor's race?	5.818220524294673
5359.    how unpartisan will be the	recommendations	of lt gov garland byrd's senate committee	on government operations?	3.7868883047225013
5360.    the situation already was bad because	the legislature moved the governor's race forward a few months	causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual.	4.731915985709852
5361. but	when former gov marvin griffin and lt gov byrd accepted	the invitations of the georgia state chamber of commerce to join	the tour next november the situation was aggravated.	3.18240511022072
5362. neither	had a choice other than to accept the invitation.	6.709983941066315
5363. to have refused	would have been political suicide.	5.048050280116332
5364. and it may be that one or both men	actually welcomed the opportunity when the bravado comments are cast	aside.	6.717564710046971
5365. the georgia state chamber of commerce tried to guard	against the danger of eliminating potential candidates.	3.659058138840737
5366. it wanted	the state democratic executive committee to pick the serious	candidates.	6.723605181415871
5367. but state party chairman james gray of albany	said no and he didn't mince any words.	3.53380234088168
5368. they are just asking	too much he said.	7.130085106078323
5369. we can't think of anyone else who would want	to separate serious candidates from other candidates either.	3.664571511338654
5370. there are other dangers:   politics is an accelerating game.	7.010039148008107
5371. if an opponent accuses you of lying don't deny it.	4.299564757399604
5372. say he is	a horse thief runs an old adage.	5.886775612662998
5373. if either one ever started making promises there is no telling where	the promises would end.	4.179715466998794
5374. griffin's rural roads authority and byrd's	60000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper's oaths.	5.500057656546165
5375. the trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such	a good one.	3.7240889367752184
5376. why not have them travel the state in november debating?	8.146138993958294
5377. 	it would present a forum for them in almost every community.	4.102347292110622
5378. but further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor's	race being run in the next legislature the spectre of big spending	programs the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin.	5.020941515430913
5379. there isa way out of this.	6.079027892246913
5380. the chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative	forum.	5.73151032325704
5381. it has arranged a campaign for governor.	5.265568952802836
5382. if	it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed	next spring and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates	it can provide a service to the state.	5.0440962428545335
5383. but the legislature should	be granted the opportunity to compelte its work before choosing	up sides for the race.	3.8112749174688227
5384. former british prime minister attlee says eisenhower was	not a	great soldier.	5.379806591276404
5385. ike's somewhat like george washington.	4.540165272337349
5386. both won a pretty fair-sized war with a modest assist from british strategy.	5.916198904248554
5387. congressmen returning from recess say the people admire	president kennedy so much they're even willing to heed his call	to sacrifice- and give up his program.	3.248298071560786
5388. slogan of the john	birch society: paddle your own canoe.	5.6949573429346065
5389. the guy who makes the	motor boats may be a communist.	3.9434405297515385
5390. a republican survey says	kennedy	won the '60 election on the religious issue.	5.5755365064465074
5391. too many people were	afraid if the gop won they'd have to spend all their time praying.	4.020197630520204
5392. the providence journal editorial entitled east	greenwich faces a housing development problem points to a	dilemma that faces communities such as ours.	4.574669046112386
5393. your suggested solution	it seems to me is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your	generally realistic attitude toward and endorsement of sound planning.	3.515695388687657
5394. first of all there is ample area in east greenwich already	zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested.	5.8182809614261375
5395. this land is in various stages of development in several locations	throughout the town.	3.912537860672157
5396. the demand for these lots can be met for some	time to come.	5.506211442665388
5397. this would seem to indicate that we are trying neither	to halt an influx of migrants nor are we setting up such standards	for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy	land and build in the new sites.	3.7735188111806535
5398. what we are attempting to	do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density	residential areas and industrial and commercial development.	5.392315231977394
5399. it	is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial	development to help pay governmental costs.	3.946450175004832
5400. bostitch inc is	approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate	tax.	5.450821204090114
5401. the wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter	but this particular instance is in my opinion completely satisfactory.	3.231715479021801
5402. the 1960 tax book for east greenwich indicates a valuation for this	property in excess of two million dollars.	5.044035209287103
5403. with our current $3 per	hundred tax rate it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you	suggest a community should try to develop a modest industrial plant	as the best way to meet these problems.	3.5251733543558976
5404. in order to attract	additional industry that is compatible with this community it is	all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly	balance in the tax structure.	5.373397034208023
5405. as this tax base grows so then can your	medium and low density residential areas grow.	3.6233099898178485
5406. mr richard preston	executive director of the new hampshire state planning and	development commission in his remarks to the governors conference	on industrial development at providence on october 8 1960 warned	against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce	the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when	he said: if this is the fundamental reason for a community's	interest or if this is the basic approach success if any will be difficult	to obtain.	4.8957243444117875
5407. he went on to say: in the first place industry	per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities.	4.313464356961112
5408. it is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased	municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be.	6.246556425837346
5409. while councilman olson cited the anticipated increase in school	costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer the impact upon	a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes	to find alarm in uncontrolled growth.	3.403332755027915
5410. we in east greenwich have the	example of two neighboring communities one currently utilizing double	sessions in their schools and the other facing this prospect next year.	5.352546484182088
5411. it has already been reported in your newspapers that the east greenwich	school committee is considering additions to at least one	elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations	for a school population that we know will increase.	3.982037840661197
5412. if they are to	be commended for foresight in their planning what then is the judgment	of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage?	5.624028454353306
5413. 	where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies	within the community that you have called for in other editorials?	3.818410568716049
5414. 	i submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not	facing the facts of life.	5.382871288836666
5415. the fruitful course of metropolitanization	that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of	east greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it	was called.	3.0910642412883136
5416. for example:  the east greenwich police department	utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the warwick police	department thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and	ensuring police coordination in the cowessett-east greenwich-potowomut	area of the two communities.	4.9294426388818895
5417. the east greenwich	fire district services parts of warwick as well as east greenwich.	3.811867493589744
5418. the taxpayers of east greenwich appropriate sums of money	as do other kent county communities for the support of the kent	county memorial hospital a regional facility.	4.76682845802813
5419. the east	greenwich free library receives financial support from the town of	east greenwich and the city of warwick to supplement its endowment.	3.609507121358519
5420. feelers were put out last year to the city of warwick	as reported in your newspapers suggesting investigation of a common rubbish	disposal area to service the potowomut and cowessett areas of	warwick along with east greenwich.	4.903959718214953
5421. east greenwich was one	of the first rhode island towns to enter into contract agreement with	the rhode island development council for planning services we	could not provide for ourselves.	3.4182401098925497
5422. the education program for retarded	children conducted by the east greenwich school system has pupils	from at least one neighboring community.	5.489416448253688
5423. i feel compelled	to write this because i am greatly concerned with the problem of community	growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town	such as east greenwich.	3.8702026605076933
5424. i believe it is an area in which professional	planners have failed to set adequate guide posts; and yet they cannot	ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly	all the planning programs they have devised.	5.550074334320643
5425. these programs are	volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must	stand aside while land developers tell them when where and in what	manner the community shall grow.	3.309388332444444
5426. we have far less to fear in the migrant	family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions.	6.086173222054032
5427. until professional planners meet this situation squarely	and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts	i hope we in east greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny.	3.540519133273516
5428. i would like very much on behalf of my husband and myself to	send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the	gabrielle fund.	5.8649567072318005
5429. it is indeed true as stated in the famous	novel of our day for whom the bell tolls that no man	is an island entirely of itself; every man is a piece of the continent	a part of the main.	3.5595555408525508
5430. thanks to the generosity of mr	irving j fain president of the temple beth el; rev	dewitt clemens pastor of the mathewson street methodist church;	mr felix miranda of the imperial knife co; and to mrs	rozella switzer regional director of the national conference	of christians and jews who asked them to serve as a committee for	the fund.	4.860059994747091
5431. it is through them that we have become aware of the divine	humanity in man and therefore that most people are noble helpful	and good.	4.2816699509207155
5432. bless you my friends for it is through love and service	that brotherhood becomes a reality.	6.042260292840789
5433. i am a sophomore at mount pleasant high school.	4.547662774077212
5434. my future	plans are to become a language teacher.	7.78686421811658
5435. of course having this desire	i am very interested in education.	4.284593148117931
5436. a few weeks ago i read	in the bulletin that there were to be given chinese classes in cranston.	6.831244058614818
5437. the article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or	over and must not be going to high school to attend these classes.	3.9268433018684448
5438. the following week i read in the sunday paper that the students	of russia begin european and asian languages in the seventh grade.	4.961764169462695
5439. i wish you could see the situation as i see it.	5.044377706880652
5440. if russian	pupils have to take these languages how come american students have	a choice whether or not to take a language but have to face so many	exceptions?	6.131152333283748
5441.    i do not think that america is like russia	not in the least! i am proud of my country the small city i live	in my wonderful parents my friends and my school; but i am also	a young able and willing girl who wants to study the chinese language	but is not old enough.	3.387168850580774
5442. then people wonder why russian pupils	are more advanced than american students.	5.749900363456915
5443. well there lies your answer.	5.602157353769119
5444. at the height of the first snowstorm we had it was impossible	for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency.	6.1523437297499965
5445. however	the east providence rescue squad made its way through to my	home in time of desperation.	4.0040625399745275
5446. words cannot tell of the undivided	attention and comfort their service gave to me.	5.3960413988432885
5447. the concern they	felt for me was such as i shall never forget and for which i will always	be grateful.	3.42456397172726
5448. the rescue squad is to be praised immensely	for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather.	5.742183777192198
5449. had they not gotten	me to the hospital when they did perhaps i would not be here to	commend them at this time.	4.155811475117506
5450. many thanks for a job well	done.	8.621329278426296
5451. the providence sunday journal article asking whether	american taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway	to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities	sounds as though the providence journal is desperate for	news.	3.166358832025441
5452. usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front	page.	6.310904310690556
5453. on the question of admission to veterans administration	hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled	veterans it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly	affected by war service.	4.181936150041089
5454. it can manifest itself before discharge from	service or it can come out years later.	6.1042875374094265
5455. there is one other point	we should never lose sight of: many veterans who enter va hospitals	as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected.	3.5209549188204123
5456. no psychiatrist	could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its	effect in the ensuing years.	5.9343379518330135
5457. the arguments advanced by those individuals	and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically	curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected	case seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with	the wishes of the general public.	3.225406053067223
5458. i believe in priority for	service-connected disabled veterans in admission to va hospitals.	6.172487790356505
5459. but i don't believe we should close the door on nonservice-connected	patients.	4.55792187665826
5460. this matter is of great importance and the outcome may	mean the difference between life or death or at least serious injuries	for many veterans.	5.783776463566375
5461. some critics say that the length of stay	in a hospital is too long.	4.5157441812197305
5462. there's a reason for this length of stay.	7.06839057927105
5463. first of all the admitting physician in the va hospital gets	the patient as a new patient.	4.248776372820096
5464. he has no experience with this veteran's	previous medical record.	7.343604692141461
5465. if the doctor is conscientious he wants	to study the patient.	4.155672865204819
5466. as a result it takes a little longer than	it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient.	6.4627163378858254
5467. secondly the va physician knows that when the patient	leaves the hospital he is no longer going to have a chance to visit	his patient.	4.3960890334708225
5468. so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects	of treatment or surgery.	5.9216853882384735
5469. the american public must be presented	with the facts concerning va hospitalization.	3.9019045165823805
5470. the public	should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a va	hospital the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other.	5.2182805325428125
5471. the	responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a va	hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital.	4.106506733531223
5472. an	adequate system of va hospitals is better equipped to care for the	veterans than any 50 state hospitals.	5.426159746333329
5473. it seems that open season upon veterans' hospitalization is	once more upon us.	4.154457891788761
5474. the american medical association is once again	grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the	veterans administration medical program to the american taxpayer.	5.145230838417261
5475. do they the ama offer any solution other than outright	abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world?	3.8416732694450286
5476. 	we veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand	for medical care at va hospitals will grow proportionately as age	fosters illness.	5.282449009257676
5477. nevertheless we wonder at the stand of the ama	on the health problem confronting the aged.	4.041945725865021
5478. they opposed	the forand bill which would have placed the major burden of financial	support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction;	yet they supported the eisenhower administration which will	cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars	to initiate.	4.769589954529764
5479. no doubt there have	been moments during every presidency when the man in the white house	has had feelings of frustration exasperation exhaustion and even	panic.	3.822882442461052
5480. this we can sympathetically understand.	8.337475547191893
5481. but no president ever	before referred to his as a lousy job as walter trohan recently	quoted president kennedy as doing in conversation with sen	barry goldwater.	3.4223504044898867
5482. during his aggressive campaign to win	his present position mr kennedy was vitriolic about this country's	prestige abroad.	5.767926900575236
5483. what does he think a remark like this lousy	one does to our prestige and morale?	4.0041051800978416
5484.    if the president	of the united states really feels he won himself a lousy job	then heaven help us all.	5.928666276055827
5485. defense secretary robert s mcnamara	has asked congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters	costing about 200 million dollars.	3.3514844590479598
5486. why should congress even consider	allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection?	6.070579139983047
5487. 	top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of	massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would	persist for a long time.	3.310857143241429
5488. the scientists have also warned that no life	above ground or underground sheltered or unsheltered could be expected	to survive in an area at least 50 miles in diameter.	4.826798738801622
5489. this	sum spent for foreign economic aid the peace corps food for peace	or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries	would be an investment that would pay off in world peace increased	world trade and prosperity for every country on the globe.	3.3659055017937836
5490. let us prepare for peace instead of for a war which would mean the	end of civilization.	6.076954073600768
5491. it seems college isn't what it should be.	5.138500962787463
5492. i refer to	the attire worn by the students.	6.608368619376871
5493. upon a visit to a local junior college	last week i was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts	and the young men wearing bermuda shorts.	3.8689415337521784
5494. is this what	our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college	in a few years?	6.346794722022792
5495. 	education should be uppermost in their minds but	with this attire how can anyone think it is so?	3.6811423608447544
5496.  it looks more like	they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering	themselves.	6.432445698940908
5497. high school students have more sense of the	way to dress than college students.	4.243327954426569
5498. many high school students go past	my house every day and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen.	5.863426368049978
5499. no matter how hot the day they are dressed properly and not in shorts.	4.686036735715372
5500. the granting of	the jan masaryk award august 13 to senator paul douglas is a bitter	example of misleading minorities.	4.333943632019377
5501. douglas has consistently	voted to aid the people who killed masaryk and against principles	masaryk died to uphold.	3.8978365872951444
5502. douglas has voted for aid to communists and	for the destruction of individual freedom public housing foreign aid	etc.	5.591470272695612
5503. aug	8 the cta is urged to reduce fares	for senior citizens.	3.736892282064246
5504. rising costs have increased the difficulties	of the elderly and i would be the last to say they should not receive	consideration.	5.997883928955597
5505. but why is it the special responsibility of the cta	to help these people?	4.45062763024068
5506.    why should cta regular riders	subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the	people who drive their own cars or walk to work should?	5.371194132682763
5507.  the welfare	of citizens old and young is the responsibility of the community	not only of that part of it that rides the cta.	3.8052244549593657
5508. cta regulars	already subsidize transportation for school children policemen	and firemen.	5.639755501556749
5509. in	reply to a letter in today's voice urging the sale of meat after	6 p m i wish to state the other side of the story.	3.9163051362418675
5510. i	am the wife of the owner of a small independent meat market.	7.471920017957498
5511. my husband's	hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a	m to 7 p m the early part of the week and as late as 8 or	9 on week-ends.	4.187652921561541
5512. now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings-	and sundays too for this is coming.	6.784379096617655
5513. there is a trend to	packaging meat at a central source freezing it and shipping it to outlying	stores where meat cutters will not be required.	3.895953846164507
5514. if a customer	wishes a special cut it will not be available.	7.615315661894273
5515. we are slowly being	regimented to having everything packaged whether we want it or not.	3.980425687116819
5516. most women in this age of freezers shop for the entire week	on week-ends when prices are lower.	5.708590697736002
5517. also many working wives have children	or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them.	3.7100754006232974
5518. independent market owners work six days a week; and my husband hasn't	had a vacation in 14 years.	5.170101142464384
5519. no we are not greedy.	6.642919130973374
5520. but if we closed	the store for a vacation we would lose our customers to the chain	stores in the next block.	6.207025293116693
5521. the meat cutters' union which has	a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area	represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets.	3.5473519609812882
5522. what it is trying to do is to protect the little man too as well	as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores with choice	of cut being made by the consumer not the store.	5.937850305255562
5523. convention and sidney holzman	- i too	congratulate the american legion of which i am proud to have been	a member for more than 40 years on the recent state convention.	3.560032645017797
5524. i regret that bertha madeira today's voice obtained	incorrect information.	5.786434417052535
5525. had i been granted the floor on a point of	personal privilege the matter she raised would have been clarified.	3.9962615772978696
5526. the resolution under discussion at the convention was to require	the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the	american flag.	4.708721791282147
5527. judges under the jurisdiction of the chicago board of	election commissioners are instructed to do this.	3.8518319521950857
5528. the resolution	further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment	to their premises for the display of the flag.	4.46706462801962
5529. it was my desire	to advise the membership of the legion that the majority of polling	places are on private property and without an amendment to the law	we could not enforce this.	3.5956563894237057
5530. my discussion with reference to the resolution	was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of	election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors	who make available their private premises and not by innuendo	criticize them.	4.630622913686753
5531. at no time did i attempt to seek approval or commendation	for the members of the chicago board of election commissioners	for the discharge of their duties.	3.9696170200539274
5532. the illinois commission for handicapped	children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the catholic	charities of the archdiocese of chicago and depaul university of	the establishment of the institute for special education at the university	for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally	retarded children.	4.285799198511373
5533. in these days of serious shortage	of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped	and mentally handicapped children the establishment of such an institute	will be a major contribution to the field.	3.839624970285063
5534. the illinois	commission for handicapped children which for 20 years has had the	responsibility of coo^rdinating the services of tax supported and voluntary	organizations serving handicapped children of studying the	needs	of handicapped children in illinois and of promoting more adequate	services for them indeed welcomes this new important resource which will	help the people of illinois toward the goal of providing an education	for all of its children.	4.51255592570779
5535. i just want to let you know how much i enjoyed	your june 25 article on liberace and to thank you for it.	3.7706386340214713
5536. please	do put more pictures and articles in about liberace as he is truly	one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person.	4.92827803614884
5537. is this	perhaps	one of the things that is wrong with our country?	4.956793478603401
5538.    engineering	graduates of illinois institute of technology are reported receiving	the highest average starting salaries in the school's history-	$550 a month.	4.902730106154111
5539. my son who has completed two years in engineering	school has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled	laborer.	3.8280005012490452
5540. at a rate of $3.	10.267860505069153
5541. 22 an hour he is now earning approximately	$580 a month.	4.544736919063927
5542. ironic is it not that after completing years	of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what	he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer?	5.502903527129165
5543. 	case	editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this	page.	4.028327691191475
5544. your july 26 editorial regarding	the position of attorney general robert f kennedy on prospective	tax relief for du pont stockholders is based on an erroneous	statement of fact.	5.330488070125578
5545. as a result your criticism of attorney general	robert f kennedy and the department of justice was inaccurate	unwarranted and unfair.	4.20297328131293
5546. the editorial concerned legislative proposals	to ease the tax burden on du pont stockholders in connection	with the united states supreme court ruling that du pont must divest	itself of its extensive general motors stock holdings.	4.913254147604434
5547. these proposals	would reduce the amount of tax that du pont stockholders might	have to pay- from an estimated 1.	3.9216094909909986
5548. 1 billion dollars under present	law to as little as 192 million dollars.	6.615716605286168
5549. congressman wilbur d	mills chairman of the house ways and means committee asked	the department of justice for its views on these legislative proposals	as they related to anti-trust law enforcement.	3.6885511578183
5550. the attorney general	responded by letter dated july 19.	5.164938139177426
5551. copies of this letter were made	avaliable to the press and public.	3.9997130938892806
5552. in this letter mr kennedy	made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration-	what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust	judgments.	5.30599709778499
5553. there are a number of other considerations besides	this one but it is for the congress not the department of justice	to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation.	4.315232817041993
5554. yet your editorial said: now the attorney general	writes that no considerations 'justify any loss of revenue of this	proportion'.	5.371376900318155
5555. what mr kennedy in fact wrote was: it	is the department's view that no anti-trust enforcement considerations	justify any loss of revenue of this proportion.	3.4831118107212067
5556. the	editorial by omitting the words anti-trust enforcement totally	distorted mr kennedy's views.	5.2746957188556305
5557. the headline is offensive particularly	in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial.	3.9167690817575873
5558. church	- i concur most heartily	with today's letter on the futility of writing to sen dirksen	and sen douglas.	4.831577984290576
5559. but when you write to congresswoman	church bless her heart your letter is answered fully and completely.	3.6912545431020436
5560. should she disagree she explains why in detail.	6.629628091978492
5561. when she agrees	you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged.	4.305658152654164
5562. i think	we have the hardest working best representative in congress.	6.004620202237821
5563. drinks	- a recent news story	reported that frank sinatra and dean martin delayed 103 airplane	passengers 10 minutes in london while they finished their drinks.	3.065095457081868
5564. they do our country great harm by such actions.	7.112153155336938
5565. those in the public	eye should be good examples of american citizens while abroad.	4.434725610578415
5566. the plane should have started at the scheduled time and left sinatra	and martin to guzzle.	5.317888982787414
5567. overt socialism means government ownership and management	of a nation's main industries.	3.5489709298433088
5568. in covert socialism- toward	which america is moving- private enterprise retains the ownership	title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive	regulations actually controls them.	4.4647696465931705
5569. in order to attract	new industries 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build	government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise.	3.4071320980368687
5570. this	is a step toward overt socialism.	8.459032679956545
5571. issuing bonds for plant construction	has brought new industries to certain regions.	3.6224743329941615
5572. sir- we are	writing in reference to a recent suggestion made to the staff	of the public health nursing service of jersey city	.	5.415387006306923
5573. the day before election day to which we are entitled as a legal holiday	we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as workers	of the party.	3.390850093397489
5574. being ethical and professional people	interested in community health and well-being we felt this wasn't	a function of our position.	5.261460362093338
5575. such tactics reek of totalitarianism!	as we understand this directive was given to all city and county employes.	3.944830236737127
5576. to our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed	because of political affiliation.	5.616750353864021
5577. we therefore considered the suggestion	an insult to our intelligence ethics bill of rights	etc.	3.7445853424543185
5578. our only obligation for this day is to vote free of persuasion	for the person we feel is capable in directing the public.	5.241865938154337
5579. this is our duty- not as nurses or city employes- but as citizens	of the united states.	3.883518531453748
5580. _to the	sir- i read of a man who felt he should not build	a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to	sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters.	5.4607895636615
5581. does this man live in	a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves	but ready to demand that the community help and protect them?	3.7407048833793493
5582. 	community shelters are of course necessary for those	having	no space for shelter.	5.7878123441713685
5583. if in a town of 2000 private homes half of	them have shelters the need for the community shelters will be reduced	to that extent.	4.03441502092958
5584. in designing his home fallout shelter there	is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home's occupants	plus-one- so he will be able to take in a stranger.	5.689082596010121
5585. i	hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes	will have a change of heart will get busy and be the first member of	our plus-one shelter club.	3.5920199728820372
5586. sir- people continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer	space.	6.40159342395129
5587. it's simple enough from my point of view.	4.262710359499414
5588. it is the only method left for a man to escape from a woman's	world.	8.162680957399758
5589. sir- when	the colonies decided upon freedom from england we insisted through	the declaration of independence that the nations of the world recognize	us as a separate political entity.	3.8221378510246717
5590. it is high time the united	states began to realize that the god-given rights of men set forth	in that document are applicable today to katanga.	5.419515436900704
5591. in the united	nations charter the right of self-determination is also an essential	principle.	4.401683289875234
5592. this again applies to katanga.	7.148045136274212
5593. the people of katanga	had fought for and obtained their freedom from the communist	yoke of antoine gizenga and his cohorts.	3.6945747004785994
5594. by political economic geographic	and natural standards they were justified in doing so.	5.842716560086315
5595. the united states and the un denounce their own principles	when they defend the communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge	the right of self-determination of the katangans.	3.4000495236298494
5596. college costs	sir- permit me to commend	your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county	colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers	have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit	them to.	5.526326796981275
5597. the bill which passed the assembly last may and	is now pending in the senate should be given careful scrutiny.	3.600878666617692
5598. the procedure	for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges	and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers.	4.693628634324365
5599. under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county	college will be appointed; none will be elected.	4.479238545514439
5600. the trustees	will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board	of school estimate.	5.515126367212316
5601. this board will consist of two of the trustees	of the college and the director and two members of the board of freeholders.	4.534965178330448
5602. it will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college	and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders which shall	appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made	by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed levied	and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes.	5.415207128341965
5603. the approval of only three members of the board of	school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted	to the college.	4.031778949709679
5604. since two of these could be trustees of the college	actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected	official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue.	6.21549519127104
5605. this is taxation without representation.	5.700415426536716
5606. sir- your editorial	housing speedup is certainly not the answer to our slum problems.	6.07703671035358
5607. the very rules and regulations in every city are the primary	case of slum conditions.	3.360691105044142
5608. change our taxing law so that no tax	shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties.	4.871309038978495
5609. then see what a boom in all trades as well as slum clearance	at no cost to taxpayers will happen.	4.1277459203558955
5610. our entire economy will have	a terrific uplift.	6.742478726598884
5611. sir- an old man is kicked to death by muggers.	4.016114598597899
5612. the medical examiner	states that death was due to natural causes.	5.573606877956523
5613. i once	heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in new york	it is listed as death due to natural causes.	3.700183283013495
5614. exhibit	sir- every resident of this city	should visit the newark museum and see the exhibit our changing	skyline in newark.	5.138990422286191
5615. it will be at the museum until march 30.	5.847782217220944
5616. it is a revelation of what has been done what is being done	and what will be done in newark as shown by architects' plans models	and pictures.	5.812925836189525
5617. it shows what a beautiful city newark will become and	certainly make every newarker proud of this city.	3.6935963817900253
5618. it should	also make him desire to participate actively in civic school and religious	life of the community so that that phase of newark will live	up to the challenge presented by this exhibit.	5.180848944263986
5619. sir- i hasten to join in praise of the	men in the toll booths on the garden state parkway.	3.5829171198659338
5620. recently i traveled	the parkway from east orange to cape may and i found the most	courteous group of men you will find anywhere.	5.925514575199705
5621. one even gave my little	dog a biscuit.	4.549544436854582
5622. the viewers of the deep peep show	at 15th and m streets nw have an added attraction- the view	of a fossilized cypress swamp.	4.321689704424624
5623. twenty feet below the street level	in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site a black	coal-like deposit has been encountered.	3.8003648420622724
5624. this is a black swamp	clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees	were growing.	6.08078103699741
5625. the fossilized remains of many of these trees are found	embedded in the clay.	3.803254172132074
5626. some of the stumps are as much as three feet	long but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying	sediments.	6.676081116054594
5627. although the wood has been changed to coal much	of it still retains its original cell structure.	3.826473795830218
5628. in the clay are	entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants	growing in the region at the time.	5.414141426488665
5629. these microfossils indicate the	swamp was formed during the lower cretaceous period when dinosaurs	were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing.	3.441481726013805
5630. the 15th street deposit is not to be confused with	the nearby famous mayflower hotel cypress swamp on 17th street reported	in the washington post august 2 1955 which was probably	formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger.	4.633063485139773
5631. recently the secretary of the friends	committee on national legislation was interviewed on the air.	4.553181720338702
5632. while i respect his sincere concern for peace he made four points	that i would like to question.	5.9931820639110995
5633. he said let's work for	peace instead of protection from aggression.	4.358432811873533
5634. i would ask why	not do both?	8.157319626417467
5635.  military power does not cause war; war is the result	of mistrust and lack of understanding between people.	3.6419022417877933
5636. are we not	late especially those of us who call ourselves friends in doing enough	about this lack of understanding?	5.924648874828711
5637.   as to protection	the speaker disapproved of shelters pointing out that fallout shelters	would not save everyone.	3.8403189056011517
5638. is this a reason for saving no one?	8.184332010085583
5639.  would	the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his	boat could not pick up everyone?	3.4533636062208783
5640.   the speaker suggested	that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face.	4.9313424299753645
5641. if the world comes to this wouldn't it be the very time when courage	and american know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild?	4.010427400050551
5642. 	many of our young people think it would.	6.0529468867031095
5643. lastly the speaker	decried our organized program of emergency help calling it civilian	defense.	3.508098993350311
5644. in 1950 public law 920 created civil defense	a responsibility	of the government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property	in disaster natural or manmade.	4.985350428369018
5645. far from creating fear	as the speaker suggests preparedness- knowing what to do in an emergency-	gives people confidence.	3.8941148431234986
5646. civil defense has far to go and	many problems to solve but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer	tradition to be not only willing but prepared to care for our own families	and help our neighbors in any disaster- storm flood accident	or even war?	5.129172560668711
5647. 	it seems rather peculiar	that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves	with the protection and companionship of dogs.	3.3966669208616973
5648. i feel that few	burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone's apartment	if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide.	5.375901137252828
5649. in	addition would not the young female public of washington be afforded	a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets	if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash?	3.775174439157436
5650.    i grant that	the dog may not be really protective based on his training but if you	were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady	to molest how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with	a dog?	4.785578557143662
5651.  i would like to suggest that the landlords and commissioners	get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting	dogs in apartments.	4.100781148440279
5652. use the terraces of the	capitol for a sidewalk cafe?	6.906337013785081
5653.  could senator humphrey be serious	in his proposal?	4.481514945322058
5654.  is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists'	comfort?	8.319843190915448
5655.    perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could	be extended.	5.494941223662053
5656. the lincoln and jefferson memorials are rather bleak.	5.306425198379303
5657. why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel	too far to eat?	4.377736028167809
5658.  unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money	to support themselves during the off season.	5.730906253843198
5659. as an added suggestion	to balance the budget the government could sell advertising space	on the washington monument.	3.952563918553521
5660. it is visible throughout the city and	men from madison ave would jump at the chance.	5.581528792467908
5661. sen	hubert humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart.	4.481902244824051
5662. he like	most of us wants to be able to sit to contemplate and be moved by	the great outdoors.	5.932747502331579
5663. let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas	around fountains and gardens.	3.9869747156224133
5664. let us like the french have outdoor	cafes where we may relax converse at leisure and enjoy the passing	crowd.	5.625674870017389
5665. two strong dissents from	the majority report of the joint economic committee by	senators proxmire and butler allege that the new deal fiscal policy	of the thirties did not work.	3.4853145721070136
5666. soviets said to fear resurgence of	german militarism	for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large	powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional	warfare of the past a nullity.	5.279336937244698
5667. the united states and soviet	russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations.	4.138529490849534
5668. recent	statements	by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power	of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient	to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead	of negotiations.	4.788121156374724
5669. president kennedy was right when he said we	shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate.	4.2825828715389385
5670. i have just returned from a seven-week trip to europe and	the far east.	6.684860960054868
5671. it is quite evident that the people of western europe	are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war.	4.374622643735279
5672. the	fact is that the italians french and british know that they have	no defense against nuclear bombs.	6.1580948909362885
5673. we have no right to criticize them	as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war.	4.084092737255556
5674. we should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access	into berlin.	6.106249752084527
5675. it would be criminal folly if the communists tried to	prevent us.	4.471272116003336
5676. but there is nothing we can do to stop soviet russia from	granting de facto recognition to east germany.	6.528972260145329
5677. soviet russia has	been invaded twice by german troops in a generation.	3.8720362286002947
5678. in the last war	russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories	were devastated.	6.080602355238676
5679. the truth is that communist	russia fears the resurgence of german militarism.	3.8793481089762656
5680. berlin is merely	being used by moscow as a stalking horse.	5.8907630496046535
5681. actually the	communists	out of fear of a united and armed germany would probably be willing	to agree to a disarmed germany that would be united and neutral	and have its independence guaranteed by the u n.	3.6026072887493554
5682. if	the communists are sincere in wanting a united neutral and disarmed	germany it might well be advantageous for the german people in this	nuclear age.	4.952051118617686
5683. it could provide security without cost of armaments and	increase german prosperity and lessen taxation.	3.8806729022578543
5684. france and other western	european nations likewise fear a rearmed germany.	5.578463734904005
5685. if the german	people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany following	the example of austria.	3.922212705937351
5686. president kennedy has urged a	peace race on disarmament that might be called operation survival	which has many facets.	5.748243675818455
5687. why not make a beginning with a united and	disarmed germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing	would be guaranteed by the big four powers and the united states?	3.781256640825375
5688. 	a united germany freed of militarism might be the first step toward	disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world.	5.4380159129839365
5689. u n obligations	_to the editor of the new york	in your editorial of sept 30 the smoldering congo	you make the following comment: far too many states are following	the russian example in refusing to pay their assessments.	3.5359886671708156
5690. it	is up to the assembly to take action against them.	7.661565803518504
5691. they are violating	their charter obligation the prescribed penalty for which is suspension	of membership or expulsion.	3.706156592231621
5692. i would like to quote from	the charter of the united nations:   article 17 section	1: the general assembly shall consider and approve the budget	of the organization.	5.834676953029779
5693. section 2: the expenses of the	organization shall be borne by the members as apportioned by the general	assembly.	3.5365148777763378
5694. article 19: a member of the united nations	which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions	to the organization shall have no vote in the general assembly if	the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions	due from it for the preceding two full years.	5.364764604391829
5695. the u	s s r and her followers are careful in paying their obligations	to the regular budget.	3.176944439673927
5696. but they refuse as do the arab states	to support the united nations' expenses of maintaining the united	nations emergency force in the middle east as a buffer between	egypt and israel and the u n troops in the congo which	expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the united nations	but by a special budget.	5.760834356544803
5697. according to the official interpretation	of the charter a member cannot be penalized by not having the	right to vote in the general assembly for nonpayment of financial	obligations to the special united nations' budgets and of	course cannot be expelled from the organization	due to the fact that there is no provision in the	charter for expulsion.	3.5755805208488964
5698. connally	amendment's repeal held step toward world orderto the	in your sept 27 editorial appraisal	of the work of the first session of the eighty-seventh congress	you referred to the lack of consciousness of destiny in a time	of acute national and world peril.	5.238715860694991
5699. yet your list of things left	undone did not include repeal of the connally amendment to this country's	domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the statute	of the international court of justice.	3.388374388612974
5700. the connally	amendment says that the united states rather than the court shall	determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction	of the united states in a case before the world court to which	the united states is a party.	5.932170485205252
5701. if the case is thus determined by us	to be domestic the court has no jurisdiction.	4.143133030292754
5702. since the connally	amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other	party to a dispute with the united states it also prevents us from	using the court effectively.	6.047862798390018
5703. yet although the kennedy administration	and the eisenhower administration before it have both declared themselves	solidly for repeal of the connally amendment as contrary to	our best interests no action has yet been taken.	3.4784582590827875
5704. our destiny	in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit	of peace with justice under law.	5.420725652727025
5705. to achieve this destiny acts	as well as words are needed- not only acts that lead to physical strength	but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect.	3.3195724192983307
5706. what better affirmative step could be taken to this end	than repeal of the connally amendment- an act which could expose	the	united states to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging	attitude toward the court enable us to utilize it and advance	in a tangible way the cause of international law and order?	4.961322487950024
5707. 	we believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the	eighty-seventh congress should have included repeal by the senate	of the connally amendment.	3.372996764849859
5708. _to	many home-bound subway riders	utilizing the flushing-main street express are daily confronted with	the sight of the local departing from the woodside station as their	express comes to a stop leaving them stranded and strained.	4.661005395734429
5709. to the	tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to seventy-fourth street	and change for the ind this takes a daily toll of time and temper.	3.5398539485972558
5710. the transit authority has recently placed in operation	hold lights at bmt thirty-ninth and fifty-ninth street	stations in brooklyn.	4.3682290865793965
5711. this holds the local until the express	passengers change trains.	4.097509547152314
5712. without question this time and temper saver	should be immediately installed at the woodside station.	6.063890323214834
5713. service criticized	as a business man i have to use the telephone constantly from three	to four hours a day.	4.120527999859633

5715. it has not	been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization	which has brought about new ways of dialing.	3.938839025056394
5716. however there	are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone	operators.	6.413010254168548
5717. i have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the	young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls special long-distance	calls etc.	3.5455087291876928
5718. either it is lack of training lack of proper	screening when hiring lack of management or possibly lack of interest	on the part of the telephone company which does have a government-blessed	monopoly.	5.381482346010353
5719. i disagree with the	writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled.	4.073573794733906
5720. the funeral	for my husband was just what i wanted and i paid a fair price far	less than i had expected to pay.	4.820318426544798
5721. but the hospitals and doctors should	be.	5.253698371195348
5722. recently	i visited the very remarkable pilgrim school for retarded children.	5.687411745787859
5723. hazel park donates its recreation center five days a	week to the school.	3.5691845257426387
5724. there is no charge and no state aid.	7.338812643015789
5725. kiwanis	american legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do	what they can to bring in dollars for its support.	3.6158139879780937
5726. there are	70 children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school.	6.540408928532894
5727. reading writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts	as working in brass.	3.5987929458174444
5728. enough	trading stamps were collected to buy a 12-passenger station wagon.	5.800957649042745
5729. southfield	schools furnish an old 45-passenger bus	needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need	.	3.8268058513170846
5730. the school is located at 9-12 mile road woodward	heights.	6.362262841738842
5731. visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated	mothers can do.	3.9893380768841737
5732. i	was surprised at mayor miriani's defeat but perhaps mayor-elect	cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years	ago.	5.30428984401668
5733. maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city	departments such as welfare dpw and sanitation.	3.981272000453094
5734. negligence in	garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great.	5.383027302673612
5735. he	should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at	night.	3.881891721004826
5736. there should be better bus service and all of our city departments	and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling.	6.3198329609761235
5737. our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and i have yet to	read of a conviction in a littering case.	3.8001671424168535
5738. drunken truck drivers	in the city departments should be weeded out.	5.6332247752118665
5739. educate the city employes	to give real service to the public.	4.197103523171336
5740. after all they are paid by	the public they should be examples.	7.232642969527421
5741. are helpful	at a recent meeting of the women's	association of the trumbull ave united presbyterian	church considerable use was made of material from the detroit news	on the king james version of the new testament versus the new english	bible.	3.8042604743091015
5742. some members of the organization called attention	also to the article on hymns of inspiration the daily prayer and	three minutes a day as being very helpful.	5.711997705115747
5743. we feel that	the detroit news is to be complimented upon arranging for articles	on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material	along wholesome lines.	4.007160592941767
5744. thank you for the article by george sokolsky on the public apathy	to impudence.	5.919733037008081
5745. how old do you have to be to remember when americans	especially children were encouraged to be polite?	4.990650503938024
5746.  why has	this form of gentility gone out of american life?	6.8259558054179
5747.    how can	we old-fashioned parents who still feel that adults are due some respect	from children battle the new type of advertising that appears on	tv without denying the children the use of television entirely?	3.440602671747026
5748. 	writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of modern	parents they have observed.	5.53439811279815
5749. from necessity they are also inspired	by the hard-sell attitude of the sponsor so finally it	is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste	of his advertising.	3.889320082561674
5750. i commend senator hart for his brave fight to establish a national	park in the dunes area.	5.583632484855141
5751. i just wish	to	congratulate inspector trimmer and his efficient police troops in	cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles.	3.8905797861533666
5752. we have now a quiet	city fewer automobiles less congestion and fewer retail customers shopping	in center city.	5.419320422588002
5753. maybe he will help	to turn our fair city into a ghost town.	4.036659307062299
5754. i worked on the schuylkill	expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock	and concrete there wouldn't be an expressway.	6.053289291857493
5755. without these massive	trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future.	4.540124853294772
5756. mr george hough sounds like a business man who waits	until the last minute to leave his home or shop.	5.62345507349208
5757. the trucks today	help pay for this highway.	3.892053883113297
5758. they try to keep within the speed limits.	7.511600693445056
5759. although today's trucks are as fast as passenger cars a truck driver	has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road.	3.6034088103789133
5760. the	letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school	at 14 should have signed his letter simpleton instead of	simplicitude.	4.816801332580068
5761. such kids only wind up among the unemployed	on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden.	3.7160604850014116
5762. there are	lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates but not for	the dropouts.	6.028313867646389
5763. what we need is more vocational training in high schools	not more dropouts.	4.51105393270339
5764. _to the editor of the	i suppose i am missing some elementary point but i honestly	cannot see how two wrongs can make a right! i am referring	to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because	russia is.	4.633619613541247
5765. will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less	harmful to future generations of children?	3.752321942541847
5766.  if an atom bomb in 1945	could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have	is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it.	4.945525413517053
5767. as i see it if war starts and we survive the initial attack	enough to be able to fight back the nuclear weapons we now have-	at least the bombs- can inflict all the demage that is necessary.	3.5449439964925773
5768. why	do we need bigger and better bombs?	6.772641426959002
5769.  i repeat two wrongs do not	make a right.	4.306089928793474
5770. everyone should take time to read martin luther's hymn	a mighty fortress is our god.	5.628258316188906
5771. especially the	first half of the third verse:	_to	the editor of the inquirer: we led the	world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the	first bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki.	3.6599842226769863
5772. having led the world	in this mad race i pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead	it out of the race.	5.982152313313734
5773. are we to be the master of the atom or	will the atom be our master- and destroy us!	just because cheddi	jagan new boss of british guiana was educated in the united states	is no reason to think he isn't a red.	3.8911157620042913
5774. we have quite a few home-grown	specimens of our own.	7.250645916828873
5775. if we go all gooey over this newest castro	we've got rocks in our heads.	3.9475685152796043
5776. how	many times must we get burned before we learn?	5.889988919434671
5777. 	just to remind the communists	that the bombs dropped on japan were to end a war not start	one.	3.6125193741333153
5778. the war could have continued many years with many thousands killed	on both sides.	5.418025317182728
5779. intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets	of destruction are frightening whether they fall on japan london	or pearl harbor.	3.328675114808184
5780. that is why the united nations was formed so that	intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet	and solve problems without resorting to war.	5.601610666252422
5781. russia has showed	its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the	world.	3.9052523125455565
5782. why aren't the soviets expelled from the un?	7.211882712982162
5783. 	while	better late than never may have certain merits the posthumous	award of the nobel prize for peace to the late dag hammarskjold	strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation.	3.401168410619785
5784. had	it been bestowed while the secretary general of the united nations	was living unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in	pursuing a difficult and in many ways thankless task.	6.386796462182081
5785. according	to one report however mr hammarskjold was considered too	controversial a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last	spring.	3.568932733949625
5786. actually of course that label controversial applied	only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world	organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the soviet	union.	5.5298964395268015
5787. at khrushchev's door therefore can be placed	the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves	to be intimidated.	3.738190972227983
5788. it is well for us to remember that a wreath on a	coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed.	5.479390446436343
5789. as has happened so often in the past the ability to recognize	true greatness has been inadequate and tardy.	4.388025973263544
5790. just a brief note of	appreciation to vice president johnson and pakistani camel driver	bashir ahmad for providing a first-class example of people to people	good will.	4.9575199505022995
5791. if only this could be done more often- with such	heartening results- many of the earth's big problems would	shrink to the insignificances they really are.	3.7555494234356055
5792. thanks	for your good coverage of ahmad's visit too!	answer: east river drive	your continuing editorials concerning the schuylkill expressway	are valuable; however several pertinent considerations deserve recognition.	4.347077927718413
5793. one of the problems associated with the expressway	stems from the basic idea.	4.950235899078182
5794. we shuffle a large percentage of the cars	across the river twice.	6.734465634468131
5795. they start on the east side of the schuylkill	have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over	again to the east at their destination.	4.434034813008022
5796. bridges tunnels and ferries	are the most common methods of river crossings.	5.897464830760648
5797. each one of these	is by its nature a focal point or a point of natural congestion.	4.207045314729462
5798. we	should avoid these congestion points or putting it another way keep	cars starting and ending on the east side of the river- on the east	side.	5.155489838697752
5799. this can be accomplished by several logical steps:	so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage	paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead	directional lights as on our bridges.	3.2858442054442056
5800. one additional lane would then	be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the	traffic carrying capability of the east river drive by fifty percent.	5.153700304640714
5801. this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures	necessitated by the schuylkill expressway and without destroying	the natural beauty of the east river drive.	3.8473748658221583
5802. washington square	i wish	to advocate two drastic changes in washington square:  take	away george washington's statue.	5.303201541243915
5803. replace it with the	statue of one or another of the world's famous dictators.	4.029707463198134
5804. there's	no sense in being reminded of times that were.	6.007216719190701
5805. washington square seems	not part of a free land.	5.606811877222273
5806. it may remind one of russia china or	east berlin; but it can't remind one of the freedom that washington	and the continental soldiers fought for.	6.0209599631336435
5807. the fairmount	park commission will no doubt approve my two proposals because it	is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square.	3.28168426749932
5808. the matter may seem a small thing to some people i know but it's	a very good start on the road to totalitarianism h the commission	has posted signs in washington square saying:   the	feeding of birds is prohibited in this square.	5.056979391713611
5809. fairmount	park commission   does each tentacle of the octopus of	city government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers	an annoyance?	3.14356012126969
5810.  if birds don't belong in a square or park what	does?	6.457426901381631
5811.  they are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature.	5.467461633326269
5812. the trees are their homes; but the commission does not share	such sentiments.	5.095139183264272
5813. the whole official city apparently has an	intense hatred toward birds.	3.637873031071962
5814. starlings and blackbirds are scared off	by cannon from city hall.	5.295611680713495
5815. if any are	left presently we may expect to see signs specifically	the feeding of them too.	3.9903851048848886
5816. the city government is not	united in an all-out to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs delinquents	thugs murderers rapists subversives.	4.811049047099612
5817. let every	policeman and park guard keep his eye on john and jane doe lest one	piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive.	3.3537804329658125
5818. of	course in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and	innocent and dependent creatures die because we're afraid to feed them	and afraid to protest and say how come?	5.01667388713124
5819.  what's your motive?	5.546171133728239
5820. 	wants this deed done?	7.0221452830349005
5821. - in this small way do	the leaders of a city or of a nation iniure the masses to watching	or even inflicting torture and death upon even their fellow men.	3.249553737066722
5822. one means to help the birds occurs to me: let the chimes that	ring over washington square twice daily discontinue any piece of music	but one.	4.994830886236511
5823. let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody	has been the joy of mankind since time began the hymn abide with	me.	3.74524073801232
5824. we will know and he will know to whom it is rendered what	the birds would ask:	_to	there is a trend today to bemoan	the fact that americans are too soft.	5.49454476322961
5825. unfortunately those who	would remedy our softness seek to do so with calisthenics.	4.471592348878718
5826. they	are working on the wrong part of our anatomy.	6.927789469227907
5827. it is not our bodies	but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft.	4.0771602482737785
5828. ashamed of our wealth	and power afraid of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace	we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies.	4.720849859679862
5829. when we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which	we know to be right when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations	which do not permit self-determination when we become strong enough	to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own nation when	we recognize that our enemy is communism not war and when we realize	that concessions to communists do not insure peace or freedom then	and only then will we no longer be soft.	3.290743217268443
5830. america doesn't need	to push-up she needs to stand up!	the new column by maurice stans regarding business scandals is	fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has	some merit.	4.868234749714529
5831. however he states unequivocally the scandals in business	are far less significant than the scandals in labor.	3.8646612023392692
5832. i must	in fairness take issue with his premise primarily because the so-called	scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals.	5.120513347015886
5833. the area most prominently commented on during the mcclellan	hearings had to do with sweetheart contracts.	3.823603198412031
5834. these arrangements	would have been impossible if the business community was truly	interested in the welfare of its employes.	5.622443954201869
5835. a sweetheart arrangement	can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous	labor leaders demanding tribute.	3.2033864507113865
5836. anyone familiar with the details	of the mcclellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart	arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented	the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders.	5.5949957113023965
5837. further it	should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by congress	to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the	landrum-griffin act.	3.444349163687425
5838. the nuclear war is already being fought	except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets- not yet.	5.021750120374906
5839. it is being fought moreover in fairly close correspondence with	the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories.	3.565571190543391
5840. they predicted	escalation and escalation is what we are getting.	7.305104253865911
5841. the biggest nuclear	device the united states has exploded measured some 15 megatons	although our b-52s are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs	apiece.	3.622552353664809
5842. some time ago however mr khrushchev decided that when	bigger bombs were made the soviet union would make them.	6.318439426581881
5843. he seems	to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand since we cannot	assume that he has exploded his entire stock.	3.757792528452734
5844. and now of course	the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side.	5.783546228929838
5845. khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb?	4.9601012390560815
5846.  so be it- then	we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common	or hydrogen variety and neutron bombs which do not exist but are said	to be the coming thing.	4.682512943979749
5847. so escalation proceeds ad infinitum or more	accurately until the contestants begin dropping them on each other	instead of on their respective proving grounds.	3.3366906501512537
5848. what is needed	philip morrison writes in the cornell daily sun	is a discontinuity.	6.013306420653776
5849. the escalation must end sometime and probably	quite soon.	3.3766901727045986
5850. only a discontinuity can end it professor morrison	writes.	7.457743391372334
5851. the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction	or that of diplomatic policy.	3.4131076039350203
5852. morrison points out	that since our country is more urbanized than the soviet union or red	china it is the most vulnerable of the great powers- europe of	course must be written off out of hand.	5.712901857042973
5853. he feels therefore that to	seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united states is the	least risky path our government can take.	3.954740391194757
5854. his proposal is opposed to	that of richard nixon governor rockefeller past chairmen strauss	and mccone of the atomic energy commission dr edward teller	and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation	of the cold war.	4.570231676631847
5855. these gentlemen are calling for a resumption	of testing- in the atmosphere- on the greatest possible scale all	in the name of national security.	3.8335858493128803
5856. escalation is their first love and	their last; they will be faithful unto death.	5.929173002130167
5857. capable as their	minds may be in some directions these guardians of the nation's	security are incapable of learning or even of observing.	3.6579453381578455
5858. if this capacity	had not failed them they would see that their enemy has made a	disastrous miscalculation.	5.826142993954998
5859. he has gained only one thing- he has exploded	a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust	to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges.	3.347364316901334
5860. but if his	purpose was to inspire terror his action could hardly have miscarried	more obviously.	5.9453640212375385
5861. not terror but anger and resentment have been the	general	reaction outside the soviet sphere.	3.9929840905572145
5862. khrushchev himself is	reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused yet	our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his	footsteps.	4.833814474436293
5863. when one powerful nation strives to emulate the success	of another it is only natural.	4.147943708990487
5864. thus when the russians sent up their	first sputnik american chagrin was human enough and american determination	to put american satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable.	4.961533912816005
5865. but to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of	his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly.	4.5619085177419745
5866. when east germans fled to the west by the thousands paeans of	joy rose from the throats of western publicists.	5.981717057036764
5867. they are less vocal	now when it is the west berliners who are migrating.	5.1061523718216275
5868. the flood	is not as great- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative	account- but it is symptomatic.	5.3583034852338
5869. west berlin morale is low and	in age distribution the situation is unfavorable.	4.327174229031721
5870. nearly 18 per cent	of west berlin's 2200000 residents are sixty-five or older	only 12.	5.297344483925462
5871. 8 per cent are under fifteen.	6.06394745596759
5872. r h s crossman	mp writing in the manchester guardian states that	departures from west berlin are now running at the rate not of 700	but of 1700 a week and applications to leave have risen to 1900 a	week.	5.09375353353007
5873. the official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers	or independent professional people.	3.683487668440604
5874. whole families are moving and	removal firms are booked for months ahead.	5.720586103029227
5875. the weekly loss is partly	counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from west germany but the	hard truth says crossman is that the closing off of east berlin	without interference from the west and with the use only of east	german as distinct from russian troops was a major communist victory	which dealt west berlin a deadly possibly a fatal blow.	3.0762161152495495
5876. the	gallant half-city is dying on its feet.	6.226439563028376
5877. another piece of	evidence appears in a dispatch from bonn in the observer.	4.029030324709018
5878. mark arnold-foster writes: people are leaving west berlin	because they think it is dying.	5.995863315991641
5879. they are leaving so fast that	the president of the west german employers' federation issued an	appeal this week to factory workers in the west to volunteer for six	months' front-line work in factories in west berlin.	3.7391055147788723
5880. berlin's	resilience is amazing but if it has to hire its labor in the west the	struggle will be hard indeed.	6.065243137970256
5881. the handwriting is on the wall.	4.4191169680513545
5882. the only hope for west berlin lies in a compromise which will	bring down the wall and reunite the city.	5.326923205698102
5883. state department officials	refusing to show their passes at the boundary and driving two blocks	into east berlin under military escort will not avail.	3.4852121033538137
5884. tanks lined	up at the border will be no more helpful.	7.239089537529879
5885. the materials for compromise	are at hand: the nation walter lippmann and other sober	commentators have spelled them out again	and again.	3.093236849438788
5886. a compromise will leave both sides without the glow of	triumph but it will save berlin.	5.62866644891661
5887. or the city can be a graveyard monument	to western intransigence if that is what the west wants.	4.426205290617014
5888. the removal of stalin's body from the mausoleum he shared	with lenin to less distinguished quarters in the kremlin wall is not	unprecedented in history.	4.592545475571549
5889. it is in fact a relatively mild chastisement	of the dead.	5.076982615844736
5890. a british writer richard haestier in a book	dead men tell tales recalls that in the turmoil preceding	the french revolution the body of henry 4 who had died nearly	180 years earlier was torn to pieces by a mob.	4.804219742488535
5891. and in england after	the restoration the body of cromwell was disinterred and hanged at	tyburn.	4.176099437540053
5892. the head was then fixed on a pole at westminster and the	rest of the body was buried under the gallows.	5.632199033287189
5893. contemplating	these posthumous punishments stalin should not lose all hope.	3.842101150055133
5894. in 1899	parliament erected a statue to cromwell in westminster facing	whitehall and there presumably he still stands.	5.119414506292954
5895. nikita khrushchev	however has created yet another problem for himself.	3.892905291584818
5896. the lenin tomb	is obviously adequate for double occupancy moscow is a crowded city	and the creed of communism deplores waste.	4.377123275647989
5897. who will take stalin's	place beside lenin?	5.4023228459202794
5898.  there is karl marx of course buried in	london.	7.151987252808153
5899. the macmillan government might be willing to let him go but he has	been dead seventy-eight years and even the soviet morticians could	not make him look presentable.	3.3426551618220115
5900. who then is of sufficient stature to	lodge with lenin?	6.745696028862289
5901.  who but nikita himself?	6.134807226504275
5902.  since he has just	shown who is top dog he may not be ready to receive this highest honor	in the gift of the soviet people.	6.38588540169782
5903. besides he can hardly avoid musing	on the instability of death which what with exhumations and rehabilitations	seems to match that of life.	3.453026650331576
5904. suppose he did lie beside lenin	would it be permanent?	6.494138019159392
5905.  if some future khrushchev decided to	rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor would not the factory	workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession?	3.532145092544312
5906.  when	a man is laid to rest he is entitled to stay put.	6.552789333364189
5907. if nikita buys	a small plot in some modest rural cemetery everyone will understand.	3.7172308027000263
5908. the appointment of u thant of burma as the	un's acting secretary general- at this writing the choice	appears to be certain- offers further proof that in politics	it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential	friends.	4.796583052730573
5909. mongi slim of tunisia and frederick boland of ireland	were early	favorites in the running but france didn't like the	former and the soviet union would have none of the latter.	3.50840901758752
5910. with the	neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed	mr	hammarskjold u thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely	to be waylaid by a veto.	5.844187312423729
5911. what is interesting is that his positive	qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to	his candidacy.	4.292059780592084
5912. in all the bitter in-fighting the squabbles over election	procedures the complicated numbers game that east and west played	on the assistant secretaries' theme the gentleman from burma showed	himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat.	5.069060493958919
5913. he has	moreover another qualification which augurs well for the future.	3.8482037788922536
5914. he is a buddhist which means that to him peace and the sanctity of	human life are not only religious dogma but a profound and unshakable	weltanschauung.	5.468731672384179
5915. u thant of course will hold office until	the spring of 1963 when mr hammarskjold's term would have come	to an end.	3.6830957246735263
5916. whether the compromises- on both sides- that made	possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen.	5.365743674777692
5917. mr khrushchev's demand for a troika is dormant not dead;	the west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism	that u thant represents.	3.575069752054768
5918. in a sense the showdown promised by mr	hammarskjold's sudden and tragic death has been avoided; no precedents	have been set as yet; structurally the un is still	fluid vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership	are bringing to bear upon it.	4.764188078568926
5919. but at least the pessimists who believed	that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane	crash in the congo have been proved wrong.	3.839326448867073
5920. no one who has studied the radical right can suppose that words are	their sole staple in trade.	5.926478057777872
5921. these are mentalities which crave action-	and they are beginning to get it as messrs salsich and engh	report on page 372.	3.6700523267543694
5922. even in areas where political connotations are	left vague the spirit of vigilantism is spreading.	6.780884510647346
5923. friends a picture magazine distributed by chevrolet dealers describes	a paramilitary organization of employees of the gulf telephone	company at foley alabama.	3.220787760290438
5924. if the day should ever come that	foreign invaders swarm ashore along the gulf coast the account reads	they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained	telephone employees- all girls.	5.002506927529133
5925. h heavily armed and mobilized	as a fast-moving civil defense outfit 23 operators and office	personnel h stand ready to move into action at a minute's notice.	3.2225162314474964
5926. according to friends the unit was organized by john snook	a former world war 2 commando who is vice president and general	manager of the telephone company.	5.554627459009426
5927. the girls very fetching in their	uniforms are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck;	they are also trained with carbines automatic weapons pistols	rifles and other such ladies' accessories.	2.9297257608868077
5928. this may be opera	bouffe now but it will become more serious should the cold war	mount in frenzy.	6.128334094699583
5929. the country is committed to the doctrine of security	by military means.	3.8895058884354143
5930. the doctrine has never worked; it is not working	now.	6.407957841138589
5931. the official military establishment can only threaten to use	its nuclear arms; it cannot bring them into actual play.	3.1416780231942822
5932. a more dangerous	formula for national frustration cannot be imagined.	6.038612547239599
5933. as the civic	temper rises the more naive citizens begin to play soldier- but	the guns are real.	3.702870068958123
5934. soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they	are assured are in our midst.	5.89074784451874
5935. all false gods resemble moloch at least in the early phases of their	careers so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship	to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice.	3.742987808388231
5936. but there is reason in all things and in this country the heathenish	cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands.	6.2943850861392905
5937. the annual	butchery of 40000 american men women and children to satiate	its blood-lust is excessive; a quota of 25000 a year would be more	than sufficient.	3.000303251444213
5938. no other popular idol is accorded even that much	grace.	6.548103795586402
5939. if the railroads for example regularly slaughtered 25000	passengers each year the high priests of the cult would have cause	to tremble for their personal safety for such a holocaust would excite	demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united states.	3.4340417492820317
5940. but by comparison with the railroad the motor car is a relatively	new object of popular worship so it is too much to hope that it	may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily.	5.433971001196658
5941. yet it is plainly time to make a start and to be effective	the first move should be highly dramatic without being fanatical.	4.423946809983082
5942. here	then is what swift would have called a modest proposal by way of	a beginning.	5.481749968726555
5943. from next new year's day let us keep careful account	of each successive fatality on the highways publicizing it on all	media of communication.	3.3913980807159443
5944. to avoid suspicion of bigotry let the hand	of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five	thousandth corpse; but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery	be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners.	4.805187937990749
5945. then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution	on july 4 1963.	3.895782911967404
5946. the scene of course should be nine miles northwest	of centralia illinois the geographical center of population according	to the census.	4.837275210377736
5947. a special grandstand protected by awnings from	the midsummer sun of illinois should be erected for occupancy by	honored guests who should include the ambassadors of all those new african	nations as yet not quite convinced that the united states is	thoroughly civilized.	3.278696856399226
5948. the band should play the rogues' march as a	processional switching to hail columbia happy land! as	the trap is sprung.	4.357445679314308
5949. independence day is the appropriate date	as a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that governments	are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable	rights the first of which is life and when any government becomes subversive	of that end it is the right of the people to alter or abolish	it.	3.836008187446813
5950. the highway system is an agency of government and when it grinds	up 40000 americans every year the government is destroying its own	taxpayers which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do.	4.936177912555165
5951. hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government	but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual	citizens which would certainly alter it and definitely for	the better.	3.1435132415872795
5952. moreover the salubrious effects would not be exclusively	political but at least partially and perhaps primarily social.	6.283543126268702
5953. it	would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some	of its ancillary beliefs and practices- for instance the doctrine	that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon	not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the	cardinal sin of stasis or as it is generally termed staying put.	3.196211832249603
5954. true the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor	even a miniscule sect and their credo home-keeping hearts are	happiest is as disreputable as socinianism.	4.868452058655704
5955. nonetheless although	few in number they are a stubborn crew as tenacious of life as the	hardshell baptists which suggests that there is some kind of vital	principle embodied in their faith.	3.672750069874566
5956. perhaps there is more truth than we	are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of tarheelia	robert ruark's grandfather who was persuaded that the great curse	of the modern world is all this gallivantin'.	5.161620813085065
5957. in any	event the yearly sacrifice of 40000 victims is a hecatomb too large	to be justified by the most ardent faith.	3.475682364847487
5958. somehow our contemporary moloch	must be induced to see reason.	5.908714558099767
5959. since appeals to morality to humanity	and to sanity have had such small effect perhaps our last recourse	is the deterrent example.	3.348849985392986
5960. if we make it established custom that	whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive say beyond 25000	per annum then somebody is going to hang it follows that the	more eminent the victim the more impressive the lesson.	5.044256521134377
5961. to hang 50	governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related	to the highways; so all things considered the highway commissioners	would seem to be elected.	3.9141536440072713
5962. as the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly	around the earth the soviet union stands guilty of a monstrous crime	against the human race.	5.371286904282082
5963. but the guilt is shared by the united states	britain and france the other members of the atomic club.	4.542142047520861
5964. until	moscow resumed nuclear testing last september 1 the us and	uk had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere	as the russians and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still	coming down.	4.746667883861304
5965. as it descends the concentration of radioactivity builds	up in the human body; for a dose of radiation is not like a flu	virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies.	3.4381854462544807
5966. the effect of	radiation is cumulative over the years- and on to succeeding generations.	5.17439524666808
5967. so while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning history	is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the	west were so quick to assume when mr khrushchev made his cynical	and irresponsible threat.	3.2929496819937514
5968. shock dismay and foreboding for future	generations were legitimate reactions; a holier-than-thou sermon was	not.	4.8309909541536475
5969. on october 19 after the soviets had detonated at least	20 nuclear devices ambassador stevenson warned the un general	assembly that this country in self protection might have	to resume above-ground tests.	3.2660584697118145
5970. more recently the chairman of the atomic	energy commission dr glenn t seaborg admitted	to a news conference in las vegas nevada that the us might	fall behind russia if the	soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain.	5.183523513908962
5971. the	trial balloons are afloat.	4.885762953400104
5972. all of which makes it more imperative	than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood.	6.027358911477241
5973. but for the average citizen unfortunately this is one of science's	worst-marked channels full of tricky currents and unknown	depths.	4.300455590354308
5974. the scientists in and out of government do not agree on some	of the most vital points at least publicly.	5.639708492039504
5975. on the one hand the public	health service declared as recently as october 26 that present	radiation levels resulting from the soviet shots do not warrant	undue public concern or any action to limit the intake of radioactive	substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the	us.	3.195767263510829
5976. but the phs conceded that the new radioactive particles	will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations	and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the united	states.	5.94804846038643
5977. then it added: it is not possible to determine	how extensive these ill effects will be- nor how many people will	be affected.	3.9989142978701184
5978. having hedged its bets in this way phs	apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination	after all: at present radiation levels and even at somewhat	higher levels the additional risk is slight and very few people will	be affected.	5.250083131141686
5979. then to conclude on an indeterminate note: nevertheless	if fallout increased substantially or remained high for	a long time it would become far more important as a potential health	hazard in this country and throughout the world.	3.5580006609281036
5980. dr linus	pauling a nobel prize winner in chemistry has been less ambiguous	whether you choose to agree with him or not.	5.479734336736925
5981. after declaring in	an article last month in frontier magazine that the russian testing	carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences	of any action in the history of the world he gave this estimate	of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new soviet shots totaled	200 megatons:   the damage to human germ plasm would be	such that in the next few generations 160000 children around the world	would be born with gross physical or mental defects.	3.5596961767929938
5982. long-lived carbon-14	from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic neonatal	or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations	and between 200000 and one million human beings now living would have	their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia.	4.388782172374256
5983. most of these would be in the northern hemisphere where the fallout	is concentrating.	5.302970160673804
5984. pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from	the present series of russian tests will probably turn out to be	too high but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility.	4.986545469586412
5985. the lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due	in part to insufficient data covering large population groups from	which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn.	3.2962089021096292
5986. but more than one conscientious	researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion	of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout	has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem.	5.389293419762322
5987. its	dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe	national security requires further testing.	3.7671051206724284
5988. an illustration of this	attitude is found in john a mccone's letter to dr thomas	lauritsen reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the new	republic.	5.4092361458233365
5989. to this day the atomic energy commission shies	away from discussing the health aspects of fallout.	4.253517889494272
5990. a recent study	on radiation exposure by the aec's division of biology and	medicine stated: the question of the biological effect h of radiation	doses is not considered herein.	5.069319410677933
5991. of course the aec	is in a bind now.	4.977861089344138
5992. if it comes down too hard on the potential dangers	of fallout it will box the president on resuming atmospheric tests.	5.899535826542259
5993. so the commission's announcements of the new soviet shots have	been confined to one or two bleak sentences with the fission yield usually	left vague.	4.148935261038951
5994. now of course that the russians are the	nuclear villains radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid-1950s	when the us was testing in the atmosphere.	6.0926254785166325
5995. the prevailing	official attitude then seemed to be that fallout if not exactly good	for you might not be much worse than a bad cold.	3.709554723166035
5996. after a nuclear blast	one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days about all you had	to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof.	4.8522198057037444
5997. things	aren't that simple anymore.	4.937676637372945
5998. yet if washington gets too indignant	about soviet fallout it will have to do a lot of fast footwork	if america decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count.	5.896626174206888
5999. as of october 25 the aec	had reported 24 shots in the new soviet series 12 of them in a megaton	range including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons	; and	president kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported.	3.7040516044645386
6000. assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot	estimated by the japanese at 10 megatons a conservative computation	is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60	megatons.	4.935616789072045
6001. some government scientists say privately that the figure	probably is closer to 80 megatons and that the full 50-megaton bomb	that khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated.	3.6156337627020263
6002. if the new	soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous russian	tests the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion meaning a	fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far.	4.769457695704477
6003. to this must be added the	90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the	atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that	began in november 1958.	3.209472459889158
6004. one of the inescapable realities	of the cold war is that is has thrust upon the west a wholly new	and historically unique set of moral dilemmas.	5.5610490828815955
6005. the first dilemma was	the morality of nuclear warfare itself.	4.136411286096974
6006. that dilemma is as much with	us as ever.	6.973915817053922
6007. the second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear	testing a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present	series of soviet tests.	3.702761817257296
6008. when this second dilemma first	became	obvious- during the mid to late '50's- the united states	appeared to have three choices.	5.523413793507998
6009. it could have unilaterally abandoned	further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations.	4.218883642107791
6010. it could have continued testing to the full on the grounds	that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of communist	world domination.	6.357881506311317
6011. or it could have chosen to find- by negotiation-	some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security.	4.012951822830819
6012. this	third choice was in fact made.	7.744788876669552
6013. with the resumption of soviet	testing and their intransigence at the geneva talks however the	hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken.	3.423271325796965
6014. once	again the united states must choose.	8.978420131827372
6015. and once again the	choices	are much the same.	4.897599260934394
6016. only this time around the conditions are different	and the choice is far harder.	6.765099312808526
6017. the first choice abandoning tests	entirely would not only be unpopular domestically but would surely	be exploited by the russians.	3.4633045153613646
6018. the second choice full testing has	become even more risky just because the current soviet tests have	already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere.	4.819625423028915
6019. the third choice negotiation	presupposes as russian behavior demonstrates a great deal	of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable.	3.669083418284203
6020. we take the	position however that the third choice still remains the only sane	one open to us.	6.314372677171257
6021. it is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice	and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable.	4.01399056348137
6022. its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice; one which should	it fail will not have contaminated the conscience.	6.935212262151302
6023. that is the	contamination we most fear.	5.317311059528454
6024. leaving aside the choice of unilateral	cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral the question	must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part	would not be a good choice.	5.162193756488234
6025. for that is the one an increasingly large	number of prominent americans are now proposing.	4.868583228014521
6026. in particular governor	nelson rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as	anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests.	5.380481656975287
6027. speaking	recently in miami governor rockefeller said that to assure	the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent soviet	tests we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests.	3.5290110982069685
6028. taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be	unpopular in world opinion he argued that the responsibility of the united	states is to do confidently and firmly not what is popular	but what is right.	5.90720421585484
6029. what was missing in the governor's	argument as in so many similar arguments was a premise which would	enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable	to what is right.	3.557147744282483
6030. the possibility as he asserted that the russians	may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests	does not supply the needed ethical premise- unless of course we have	unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken	as a moral demand.	4.549640114922609
6031. besides the lack of an adequate ethical	dimension to the governor's case one can ask seriously whether our	lead over the russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons	is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary.	3.537409621487353
6032. recent statements	by the president and defense department spokesmen have to the	contrary assured us that our lead is very great.	5.505913200964625
6033. unless the administration	and the defense department have been deceiving us the facts	do not support the assertion that we are compelled to resume atmospheric	testing.	3.8133708001189732
6034. it is perfectly conceivable that a resumption	of atmospheric tests may at some point in the future be necessary	and even justifiable.	5.752061959901239
6035. but a resumption does not seem justifiable now.	5.3889981674657195
6036. what we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination	of the atmosphere by the soviet tests has radically increased our	own moral obligations.	6.225334162614109
6037. we now have to think not only of our national	security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests	we might undertake.	4.132953318901021
6038. this is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded	or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even	of the evil of communism.	5.104787567677497
6039. too often in the past russian	tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part.	4.431519037838832
6040. there ought	to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless	of what russia does.	5.891816855366879
6041. the refusal to resume atmospheric testing	would be a good start.	3.728838287231211
6042. when his holiness	pope john 23 first called for an ecumenical council and at the	same time voiced his yearning for christian unity the enthusiasm	among catholic and protestant ecumenicists was immediate.	5.068952655410852
6043. with good	reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided christendom.	4.1322846806902565
6044. but	as the more concrete plans for the work of the council gradually became	known there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides.	6.167611526206004
6045. the council we now know will concern itself directly only with	the internal affairs of the church.	3.361752345636786
6046. as it has turned out however	the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of	hope in the second were both wrong responses.	6.233507261017406
6047. two things have happened	in recent months to bring the council into perspective: each provides	a basis for renewed hope and joy.	3.7744603248720137
6048. first of all it is now	known that pope john sees the renewal and purification of the church	as an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity.	5.093937184018013
6049. far from	being irrelevant to the ecumenical task the pontiff believes that a	revivified church is required in order that the whole world may see catholicism	in the best possible light.	3.6859509014674186
6050. equally significant pope john	has said that catholics themselves bear some responsibility for christian	disunity.	5.537209001092656
6051. a major aim of the council will be to remove as	far as possible whatever in the church today stands in the way of unity.	4.227588741507594
6052. secondly a whole series of addresses and actions by the	pope and by others show that concern for christian unity is still very	much alive and growing within the church.	5.08116749256842
6053. the establishment by the	holy father of a permanent secretariat for christian unity in	1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern.	3.458467917980775
6054. the designation of	five catholic theologians to attend the world council of churches	assembly in new delhi as official observers reverses the church's	earlier stand.	4.701494326876715
6055. the public appeal by the new vatican secretary	of state cardinal cicognani for renewed efforts toward eastern	and western reunion was still another remarkable act.	3.240358098659535
6056. nor can one	forget pope john's unprecedented meeting with the archbishop of canterbury.	6.347455731427985
6057. augustin cardinal bea the director of the secretariate	for christian unity has expressed as directly as anyone the	new spirit that pervades the church's stance toward the protestant	and orthodox churches.	3.183106038408729
6058. noting all the difficulties that stand in	the way of reunion he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone.	5.943102869922075
6059. for discouragement or the temptation to abandon our efforts would	show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without	thinking of the omnipotence of god the irresistible efficacy of	prayer the action of christ or the power of the divine spirit.	3.4727684067943128
6060. can any christian fail to respond to these words?	7.245400355395225
6061. 	the administration's official budget review which estimates	a 6.	3.746151910255719
6062. 9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year isn't	making anyone happy.	5.798834484466335
6063. certainly it isn't making the president happy	and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget	got into its unbalanced condition how he intends to economize wherever	he can and how he hopes to do better next year.	3.5407366132300644
6064. we sympathize	with mr kennedy but we feel bound to say that his budget review	doesn't please us either although for very different reasons.	5.544554829639636
6065. furthermore we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying	than reassuring.	4.238029780169454
6066. in the first place a large part of the	discrepancy between president eisenhower's estimate of a 1.	6.452803111999508
6067. 5 billion	dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost	seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing president's	farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor.	4.133137821881351
6068. the eisenhower	budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and	yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received.	4.57844960909718
6069. the	rest of the deficit is also easily understood.	4.650055576380011
6070. four billion dollars	of the spending increase is for defense an expenditure necessitated	by the penny-wise policies of the eisenhhower administration quite	apart from the recent crises in berlin and elsewhere.	4.84524419900458
6071. four hundred	million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program a	responsibility similarly neglected by mr eisenhower.	3.9951910755062223
6072. the farm program	will cost an additional 1.	5.915937106306113
6073. 5 billion because of unusual weather	factors the food for peace program and other new measures.	4.154130186797966
6074. anti-recession	programs- aid for the unemployed their children and for depressed	areas- account for only 900 million of the 6.	5.510581528408262
6075. our complaint is that in many crucial areas the kennedy	programs are not too large but too small most seriously in regard	to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures.	3.5540574923928148
6076. and yet mr kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents	of the right with apologies and promises of tightening up and	economizing.	5.344902496749796
6077. we wish the president would remember that fiscal	responsibility was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election.	4.157206274882723
6078. the party that won used to say something about a new frontier.	6.158154980725491
6079. introduction of the dialogue principle	proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting	of the catholic association for international peace in washington	the last weekend in october.	3.242936529518669
6080. two of the principal addresses were delivered	by prominent protestants and when the speaker was a catholic	one discussant on the dais tended to be of another religious	persuasion.	5.863660043769611
6081. several effects were immediately evident.	5.3640111994084805
6082. sessions	devoted to ethics and foreign policy trends moral principle	and political judgment christian ethics in the cold	war and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this	procedure than if catholics were merely talking to themselves.	4.588553139838113
6083. usually	questions from the floor were directed to the non-catholic speaker	or discussion leader.	3.6923925994009976
6084. in the earlier sessions there was plentiful	discussion on the natural law which dr william v o'brien	of georgetown university advanced as the basis for widely acceptable	ethical judgments on foreign policy.	5.039844607242135
6085. that aristotelean-thomistic	principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the	participants but in the end the concept came to reassert itself.	4.488442334546182
6086. speakers	declared that protestants often make use of it if perhaps	by some other name.	5.967256500672669
6087. a lebanese moslem told about its existence and	application in the islamic tradition as the divine law while a	caip member who has been working in close association	with delegates of the new un nations told of its widespread recognition	on the african continent.	3.3182046322872365
6088. the impression was unmistakable	that whatever one may choose to call it natural law is a functioning	generality with a certain objective existence.	5.083589030370649
6089. another question	that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself.	5.199376983101423
6090. the stimulus from	the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences	was undeniable.	4.699138925642624
6091. it was expected that the comparison of different	approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other's	positions and better comprehension of one's own.	3.4914025650395533
6092. but a realization	that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed	and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions	to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political	issues.	4.85301393449161
6093. one effect of the spirited give-and-take of these	discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity	of being armed with the facts: knowledge of the destructive	force of even the tiniest tactical atomic weapon would have a bearing	on judgments as to the advisability of its use- to defend berlin	for example; the pervasive influence of ideology on our political	judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account; it	is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the christian	imperative.	3.1373296632802052
6094. everywhere i went in formosa i asked the same question.	6.926898063633976
6095. i was searching	for an accent of self-delusion or even of hypocrisy.	4.385707991553864
6096. i never	found it among any of the chinese with whom i spoke though granted	they were almost all members of the official family who presumably	harbor official thoughts.	5.814895778894882
6097. but i questioned also professional soldiers	who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian's dreamy	irredentism.	3.778820663032897
6098. their answer was: it can be done and we will do it.	8.317254588884454
6099. and then i put the question as pointedly as i could directly to chiang	kai-shek: in america i said practically no one	believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the mainland.	3.448102321750173
6100. what	evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government	proposes to do just that and that it can be done?	6.2590985013938205
6101.    he smiled.	6.752649817075903
6102. also at a british bloke seated next to me who asked the most asinine	questions.	6.288812909623921
6103. i recalled sympathetically the duke's complaint in browning's	he smiled and said a word	or two to the interpreter who turned to me the president wonders	where you are going after you leave taipei?	3.450179530756379
6104.  that i smarted	is a royal rebuff if ever there was one.	6.167976462644006
6105. i answered the routine	question about my itinerary rather coolly.	4.006857097892731
6106. chiang spoke again	this	time at greater length.	6.436285034405596
6107. the president says the translator	came in that the reason he asked you where you were going is because	he hoped you would be visiting other areas in southeast asia and	that everywhere you went you would seek the answer to your question.	3.521822797571735
6108. he says that if he were to express to you once again his own profound	determination to go to the mainland and his faith that that return	is feasible he would merely sound redundant.	5.940504227139186
6109. so you yourself must	seek these objective data and come to your own conclusions.	4.443410734696322
6110. any information	we have here in taiwan is at your disposal.	6.6071214746780145
6111. what are the relevant data?	6.049484253427465
6112.  for every person on taiwan there	are sixty in mainland china.	6.2987814160327105
6113. if the raw population figures are	crucially relevant then it is idle to think of liberation as idle as	to suppose that poland might liberate russia.	3.703994258239332
6114. relative military manpower?	8.217041520267811
6115. 	less than 60-1 but at least 6-1.	4.5619816908422965
6116. the estimates vary widely	on the strength of the chinese army.	5.663845938475368
6117. the armed	forces of taiwan are at a working strength of about 450000 though	a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated.	3.0889379703509907
6118. skill?	11.55875815210223
6119.  training?	7.781497302878112
6120. 	morale?	11.55875815210223
6121.  it is generally conceded that the formosan air force	is the best by far in asia and the army the best trained.	3.8292186470253324
6122. the morale	is very high.	5.924902573517046
6123. even so it adds up to impossible odds except	that the question arises on whose side would the mainland chinese	army fight?	3.684331151400369
6124.    the miserable people of china the largest cast	ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play cannot themselves	resist overtly.	4.5621270441574024
6125. they think perforce of physical survival:	everything else is secondary.	4.286831780035889
6126. but the army which mao continues to feed	well where are its sympathies?	5.864994679114777
6127.  the psychological strategists in	taiwan stress the great sense of family cultivated in china over	thousands of years.	3.187496142351295
6128. it has not been extirpated by ten years of communist	depersonalization.	7.476384371265573
6129. every soldier in the army has somewhere relatives	who are close to starvation.	4.310714636095958
6130. the soldiers themselves cannot stage	a successful rebellion it is assumed: but will their discontent	spread to the officer class?	4.724476994399411
6131.  the immediate families of the generals	and the admirals are well fed: a despot does not economize on his	generals.	3.0593521645977004
6132. but there are the cousins and aunts and nephews.	7.512885205091452
6133. their privations	are almost beyond endurance.	5.0385952345964835
6134. in behalf of what?	8.309623485598273
6135.  leninism-marxism	as understood by exegete mao.	4.47272175773081
6136. to whom will the generals stay	loyal?	7.586736289151621
6137.  there is little doubt if they had a secret ballot they	would vote for food for their family in place of ideological purity out	on the farm.	4.0771122121398005
6138. it is another question whether they- or a single	general off in a corner of china secure for a few	days at least from instant retaliation- will defy the party.	5.227710032315634
6139. but	the disposition to rebel is most definitely there.	4.336758626782752
6140. but there	must be a catalytic pressure.	7.060009728549242
6141. the military in taiwan believe that	the communists have made two mistakes which together may prove fatal.	3.2874951259672067
6142. the first was the commune program which will ensure agricultural	poverty for years.	5.737366596798112
6143. the family is largely broken up; and where it	is not it is left with no residue and the social meaning of this is	enormous.	3.7798773565302697
6144. for it is the family that in china has always provided social	security for the indigent the sick the down-and-out members of	the clan.	6.055162795728998
6145. now the government must do that; but the government is	left with no reserve granary under the agricultural system it has ordained.	3.6560318741131
6146. thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of	social security which had traditionally been privately discharged and	created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems	of social security.	4.77649597689462
6147. the second mistake is tibet.	4.691961439306809
6148. tibet has	historically served china as a buffer state.	6.571596644278629
6149. a friendly state sometimes	only semi-independent but never hostile.	3.884079007556175
6150. china never tried to	integrate tibet by extirpating the people's religion and institutions.	5.0967039088477275
6151. red china is trying to do this and she is not likely ever to succeed.	5.23867866555713
6152. tibet is too vast the terrain is too difficult.	6.392852387542922
6153. tibet may bleed	china as algeria is bleeding france.	4.113510116867142
6154. these continuing	pressures social economic and military are doing much to keep china	in a heightening state of tension.	5.638457442503488
6155. the imposition of yet another pressure	a strong one from the outside might cause it to snap.	3.6347563123258158
6156. the planners in taiwan struck me as realistic men.	5.413845099331095
6157. they know that	they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control.	4.04536069361025
6158. first	and foremost they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the communist regime.	6.727329878448015
6159. on these they feel they can rely.	5.591151666639735
6160. secondly they depend on america's	moral cooperation when the crucial moment arrives.	6.162693628869476
6161. they	hope that if history vouchsafes the west another budapest we will	receive the opportunity gladly.	3.5248935261794325
6162. i remarked jocularly to the president	that the future of china would be far more certain if he would invite	a planeload of selected american liberals to quemoy on an odd	day.	4.981489306566719
6163. he affected not to understand my point.	4.551653941808663
6164. but he-	and all of china- wear the scars of american indecisiveness and	he knows what an uncertain ally we are.	4.993135654247499
6165. we have been grand to formosa	itself- lots of aid and most of the time a policy of support	for the offshore islands.	4.44755922372318
6166. but our outlook has been and continues to	be defensive.	6.550764436119218
6167. a great deal depends on the crystallization of mr	kennedy's views on the world struggle.	4.443564446613482
6168. the free chinese know that	the situation on the mainland is in flux and are poised to strike.	5.01650736015275
6169. there is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized	force for liberation.	4.112594130538983
6170. the moment of truth is the moment of crisis.	7.280334839988983
6171. during the slow buildup	the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details	fine words strutting gestures.	3.872704130972495
6172. the crisis burns these suddenly	away.	6.405031005388266
6173. there the truth is open to eyes that are willing to look.	5.3970632244576455
6174. new self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked	bones.	6.260895530773775
6175. a truth-revealing crisis erupted in katanga for	a couple of days this month to be quickly smothered by the high pressure	verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies.	3.3322939779741794
6176. before memory	too clouds over let us make a note or two of what could be seen.	6.29981772487243
6177. the measure was instantly taken as always in such cases of	public men at many levels.	3.377177781791267
6178. one knows better now who has bone and	who	has jelly in his spine.	5.893049040460336
6179. but i am here concerned more with policy	than with men.	4.506899313000043
6180. public men come and go but great issues of policy remain.	6.215483891491437
6181. now everyone knows- or knew in the week of december 10-	that something had gone shockingly wrong with american foreign policy.	3.6519032446909883
6182. the united states was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful	orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most	pro-western and anti-communist within any of the new nations-	the only place in africa moreover where a productive relationship	between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved.	5.013112373013805
6183. of course the	fighting was officially under the auspices of the united nations.	5.1766839306792445
6184. but	in the moment of truth everyone could see that the us was	in reality the principal.	6.898198358469337
6185. the moment simultaneously revealed that	in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our nato	allies to the entire western community.	3.4463504485467102
6186. by our policy the west was-	is- split.	7.384411978888609
6187. but the key revelation is not new.	4.969446082342829
6188. the controlling	pattern was first displayed in the hungary-suez crisis of november	1956.	5.140897863355007
6189. it reappears in whole or part whenever a new crisis	exposes the reality: in cuba last spring	; at the peaks of the nuclear	test and the berlin cycles; in relation to laos algeria south	africa; right now with almost cartoon emphasis in the temporally	linked complex of tshombe-gizenga-goa-ghana.	3.079722704797674
6190. reveal	this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows:	under prevailing policy the u s can take the initiative	against the right but cannot take the initiative against the left.	5.4240042848532175
6191. it makes no difference what part of the world is involved what form	of regime what particular issue.	5.1278969438559665
6192. the u s cannot take the	initiative against the left.	6.3671200276955
6193. there is even some question whether	the u s can any longer defend itself against an initiative	by the left.	3.7860275062146846
6194. we can attack tshombe but not gigenza.	7.732080548727134
6195. no	matter that gizenga is moscow's man in the congo.	4.3538975573404635
6196. no matter that	it is his troops who rape western women and eat western men.	5.901000919767463
6197. no matter	that the katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of western	interests in africa.	4.001450373225623
6198. unified you don't protect western security by first removing	we can force	britain and france out of the suez but we cannot so much as try	to force the russian tanks back from budapest.	5.215095120916408
6199. we can mass our	fleet against the trujillos but not against the castros.	4.248728358185545
6200. we can	vote in the un against south african apartheid or portuguese rule	in angola but we cannot even introduce a motion on the berlin wall-	much less give the simple order to push the wall down.	4.9861281173686365
6201. we officially	receive the anti-french moscow-allied algerian	fln	but we denounce the pro-europe anti-communist oas as criminal.	3.3671686386035855
6202. in the very week of our war against katanga we make a $133	million grant to kwame nkrumah who has just declared his solidarity	with the communist bloc and is busily turning his own country into	a totalitarian dictatorship.	4.896210345569119
6203. as our planes land the war materiel that	kills pro-western katangans we stand supinely bleating while nehru's	troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our nato	ally portugal.	3.1627623015791078
6204. what explains this uni-directional paralysis?	7.850198109834498
6205. 	it is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes	the frame of our international- and in some degree our domestic-	policy.	3.9456280840569047
6206. the suez-hungary crisis proves that this system was not	invented by the new administration but only made more consistent and	more active.	4.976481967459546
6207. most immediately relevant to these	episodes in goa katanga and ghana as to the suez-hungary crisis	before them is the belief that the main theater of the world drama	is the underdeveloped region of asia africa and latin america.	3.720791274903612
6208. from this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy	on the uncommitted nations	especially on those whose leaders make the most noise- nehru tito	nkrumah sukarno betancourt etc.	5.0007080940516175
6209. our chief aim becomes that	of finding favor in neutralist eyes.	3.9443699017250324
6210. if we grasp this orientation	as a key our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned	becomes intelligible.	6.517831892143136
6211. and it becomes clear why in general we cannot	take the initiative against the left.	4.202138471670116
6212. to write a play the dramatist once	needed an idea plus the imagination the knowledge of life and the	craft to develop it.	5.707556197848925
6213. nowadays more and more all he needs is someone	else's book.	4.30999888390062
6214. to get started he does not scan the world about him;	he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists.	5.813339506721304
6215. so	far this season broadway's premieres have included twice as many	best from	abroad.	3.6855904414836025
6216. which owes much of its poetic power to the james agee novel a death	in the family; the wall awkwardly based on the john hersey	novel; advise and consent lively but shallow theater drawn	from the mountainously detailed bestseller; face of a hero	based on a pierre boulle novel.	4.590260115441953
6217. the only original works	attempting	to reach any stature: tennessee williams' disappointing domestic	comedy period of adjustment and arthur laurents' clever	but empty invitation to a march.	3.0332202602805243
6218. clearly the most provocative	plays are all imported originals- a taste of honey by britain's	young shelagh delaney; becket	by france's jean anouilh; the hostage by ireland's	brendan behan.	4.397808875851736
6219. among the musicals camelot came	from t h white's the once and future king and novels	were the sources of the less than momentous tenderloin and do	re mi.	3.4562703271803326
6220. wildcat and the unsinkable molly brown were originals	but pretty bad leaving top honors again to an import- the	jaunty and charmingly french irma la douce.	4.487286750489764
6221. the only other works	at least technically original were dreary farces- send me no	flowers under the yum-yum tree critic's choice.	3.1548166752783353
6222. in the forthcoming the conquering hero and carnival	broadway is not even adapting books but reconverting old movies	.	5.07031242269106
6223. originals	are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily	bad.	4.023163537365048
6224. some memorable plays have been drawn from books notably life	with father and diary of anne frank.	5.228598972462181
6225. and particularly in the	musical field adaptations have long been the rule from die fledermaus	and the merry widow to oklahoma! and my fair	lady.	3.381679672466073
6226. as critic walter kerr points out: adaptations	so long as they are good still qualify as creative.	6.001757031264614
6227. and other defenders	invariably argue that after all shakespeare and moliere were	adapters too.	3.9798310716916836
6228. the difference is that the masters took the bare frame	of a plot and filled it with their own world; most modern adapters	totally accept the world of a book squeeze it dry of life and add only	one contribution of their own: stage technique.	5.163850218871465
6229. the most	frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports	is increasing production expense- producers cannot afford to take chances.	3.0419119589380665
6230. but that explanation is only partly true.	7.866413358557472
6231. off-broadway where	production is still comparatively cheap is proving itself only slightly	more original.	3.446904320613778
6232. laudably enough it is offering classics and off-beat	imports but last week only one us original was on the boards	robert d hock's stunning civil war work borak.	5.095718152025373
6233. the	real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of us playwrights.	4.97445837515975
6234. he: come	with me to the casbah.	7.349443291624702
6235. she: by subway or cab?	4.587494350441445
6236. 	that exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in manhattan	as more and more new yorkers were discovering 29th street and	eighth avenue where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like	arabian nights grecian palace and egyptian gardens are the american	inpost of belly dancing.	4.592706615872931
6237. several more will open soon.	5.81964649265095
6238. their	burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd street	burlesque joints but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always	familial- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis.	5.722059652058767
6239. the belly boites with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted	ionic columns heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of greek	and turkish families.	2.9041015572344793
6240. customers often bring their children; between	performances enthusiastic young men from the audience will take	the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces.	5.076404207554484
6241. except for the odd	uptown sex maniac or an overeager greek sailor the people watch in	calm absorption.	3.52616542668348
6242. small shirt-sleeved	orchestras play in 24 or 44 time	using guitars violins and more alien instruments with names that	would open sesame: the oud grandfather of the lute; the darbuka	a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass; the def	a low-pitched tambourine.	4.256900225125105
6243. the girls sit quietly with the musicians wearing	prim dresses or plain secretarial shifts until it is time to	go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem.	3.2964016084089516
6244. if a dancer is good she suggests purely	and	superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny- the continuum	of mankind.	5.359903409040499
6245. but a great many of what variety calls the	cooch terpers are considerably less cosmic than that.	4.017377535625539
6246. each dancer	follows the ancient oriental pattern- she glides sideways with	shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates and through breathing	and muscle control she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips	and away to the far end of the room.	4.704874257933969
6247. this is done at varying speeds	ranging from the slow and fast shifte telli	meaning	to the fastest ecstatic karshilama	.	3.9760559434757914
6248. the new york dancers are highly eclectic varying	the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations back bends	or floor crawls.	5.485282929058603
6249. but they do not strip.	7.636339218355399
6250. the striptease is crass;	the belly dance leaves more to the imagination.	5.073843981629069
6251. when a dancer	does well she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills- although	the manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping	the tips into the dancers' costumes.	3.1640406406576638
6252. with tips the girls average	between $150 and $200 a week depending on basic salary.	5.538851547958008
6253. although	they are forbidden to sit with the customers the dancers are sometimes	proffered drinks and most of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy.	4.112464765539027
6254. all over the country belly clubs have never	been bigger especially in detroit boston and chicago and even	in small towns; one of the best dancers a turkish girl named semra	works at a roadhouse outside bristol conn.	5.245888081856426
6255. the girls are kept	booked and moving by several agents notably voluble black-bearded	murat somay a manhattan turk who is the sol hurok of the central	abdomen.	3.162103759022453
6256. he can offer nine turkish girls plans to import at least	15 more.	6.0192328883698165
6257. but a great many of the dancers are more or less native.	6.2435053035645005
6258. sometimes	they get their initial experience in church haflis conducted	by lebanese and syrians in the us where they dance with	just as	few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs.	4.842134172685286
6259. as the	girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins the melting	pot has never bubbled more intriguingly.	3.5576260799822146
6260. some manhattan examples:	jemela 23 seems hong kong oriental	but has a spanish father and an indian mother was born in america	and educated at	holy cross academy and textile high school says	she learned belly dancing at family picnics.	4.7395431906854695
6261. serene	23 was born in budapest and raised in manhattan.	4.56696604268585
6262. daughter	of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance she is one of the few	really beautiful girls in the new york casbah with dark eyes and dark	waist-length hair the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe	glimmering body.	5.249428467781649
6263. many belly dancers are married but serene is one	of the few who will admit it.	4.149776037034674
6264. marlene	25 a brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from arabic friends	in paris now lives on manhattan's west side is about the best	belly dancer working the casbah loves it so much that she dances on	her day off.	4.589910655118727
6265. she has the small highly developed body of a prime athlete	and holds in contempt the girls who just move sex.	3.6399572172377455
6266. leila 25 is a greenwich village painter of	persianesque miniatures	who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles.	4.8496737880763305
6267. a graduate of hollywood high school she likes to imagine herself	as she takes the floor a village girl coming in to a festival.	3.4827902628085115
6268. gloria circa 30 who was born	in italy and once did chorus work in toronto has been around	longer than most of the others wistfully remembers the old days	when	we used to get the seamen from the ships you know with big turtleneck	sweaters and handkerchiefs and all.	4.794890972366246
6269. but the ships are very slow	now and we don't get so many sailors any more.	3.726282277165131
6270. the uptown crowd	has moved in and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck	sweater for a button-down collar?	4.4634297995660415
6271. 	of the handful of painters that austria	has produced in the 20th century only one oskar kokoschka is widely	known in the us.	3.319839800666327
6272. this state of unawareness may not last	much longer.	6.631694278558337
6273. for ten years a small group of european and us	critics has been calling attention to the half-forgotten austrian	expressionist	egon schiele who died 42 years ago at the age of 28.	3.764021113664029
6274. the	critics' campaign finally inspired the first major us exhibit	of schiele's works.	5.32866841840633
6275. the show has been to boston and manhattan	will in time reach pittsburgh and minneapolis.	3.6692713937566763
6276. last week it opened	at the j b speed museum in louisville at the very moment	that a second schiele exhibit was being made ready at the felix landau	gallery in los angeles.	5.193118473264973
6277. schiele's paintings are anything	but pleasant.	4.552963546182761
6278. his people are angular and knobby-knuckled	sometimes painfully stretched sometimes grotesquely foreshortened.	5.53053222965987
6279. his colors are dark and murky and his landscapes and cityscapes	seem swallowed in gloom.	3.5060166067707534
6280. but he painted some of the boldest and	most original pictures of his time and even after nearly half a century	the tense tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its	fascination.	5.541655123177315
6281. the son of a railway stationmaster	schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy danubian town	of tulln 14 miles northwest of vienna.	3.3458965992405103
6282. he was an emotional lonely	boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely	any schoolwork.	5.893037861323299
6283. when he was 15 his parents finally allowed him to attend	classes at the academy of fine arts in vienna.	4.036606126962031
6284. even there he	did not last for long.	7.210411566269034
6285. cried one professor after a few months of student	schiele's tantrums and rebellion: the devil himself must	have defecated you into my classroom!   for a while his	work was influenced deeply by the french impressionists and by the patterned	mosaic-like paintings of gustav klimt then the dean of austrian	art.	3.2138480487901377
6286. gradually schiele evolved a somber style of his own-	and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter.	5.2210198123502805
6287. his pictures were	roundly denounced as the most disgusting things one has ever seen	in vienna.	3.755286904047553
6288. he himself was once convicted of painting erotica and	jailed for 24 days- the first three of which he spent desperately trying	to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle.	5.481902623026461
6289. for years he	wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars was even driven	to scrounging for cigarette butts in vienna's gutters.	3.1747742322342978
6290. drafted	into	the austrian army he rebelliously rejected discipline wangled a vienna	billet went on painting.	5.017334462467588
6291. it was not until the last year of his	life that he had his first moneymaking show.	5.102636197453442
6292. the unabashed sexuality of so many of this paintings was not the	only	thing that kept the public at bay: his view of the world was one of	almost unrelieved tragedy and it was too much even for morbid-minded	vienna.	5.503942669793871
6293. he was obsessed by disease and poverty by the melancholy of	old age and the tyranny of lust.	3.791138477675023
6294. the children he painted were almost	always in rags his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness	and his nudes- including several self-portraits- were stringy	contorted and strangely pathetic.	4.614055624115537
6295. the subject he liked most was the	female body which he painted in every state- naked half-dressed	muffled to the ears sitting primly in a chair lying tauntingly on a	bed or locked in an embrace.	2.908912158639424
6296. the most surprising thing about the twenty-second congress of	the soviet communist party is that it was surprising- perhaps	quite as much in its own way as the twentieth congress of 1956 which	ended with that famous secret report on stalin.	5.215352704023867
6297. the publication	last july of the party's draft program- that blueprint for	the transition to communism- had led the uninitiated to suppose	that this twenty-second congress would be a sort of apotheosis	of the khrushchev regime a solemn consecration of ideas which had in	fact been current over the last three or four years	in all theoretical party	journals.	2.9604938800703815
6298. these never ceased to suggest that if in the eyes of marx	and lenin full communism was still a very distant ideal the establishment	of a communist society had now under khrushchev become	an immediate and tangible reality.	5.108108179608335
6299. it seems that khrushchev	himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution	to marxist doctrine with his draft program	his twelve-hour speech at the recent congress was in fact very largely	.	3.430339835660222
6300. he and other soviet leaders	responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward	some new formulas such as the early replacement of the dictatorship	of the proletariat by an all people's state and also of having	laid down the lines for a much greater democratization of	the whole hierarchy of soviets starting with the supreme soviet itself.	4.845786234817249
6301. their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at	bureaucracy and would enable the people to take a more direct	and active part in running the country.	3.6754078662591447
6302. also elections would be	more democratic; there might even be two or more candidates for voters	to choose from.	5.705207963912397
6303. no doubt there was still a lot in the draft	program- and in khrushchev's speech- which left many points	obscure.	3.9489463616773786
6304. was it the party's intention for example to abolish gradually	the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning	sovkhozes ie state farms	?	5.397401842798228
6305.  as we know the soviet peasant today	still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on	his private plot; and it is still very far from certain how valid	the party's claim is that in a growing number of kolkhozes	the peasants are finding it more profitable to surrender their private	plots to the	kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something	increasingly like a state farm.	3.4567448897952904
6306. if one follows the reports of the	congress one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty	in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this	matter.	5.7086263587580275
6307. the draft program was interesting in other respects	too.	3.7635046481795182
6308. it contained for example a number of curious admissions about	the peasants who enjoy no sickness benefits no old-age pensions	no paid holidays; they still benefit far less than the other 50	per cent of the nation from that welfare state which the soviet	union so greatly prides itself on being.	5.443849318235344
6309. over all these	fairly awkward problems khrushchev was to skate rather lightly;	and though he repeated over and over again the spectacular figures	of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 the ordinary	people in russia are still a little uncertain as to how communism	is really going to work in practice especially in respect of food.	3.372556760701047
6310. would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry?	7.153641035529133
6311.  this was something	on which k himself seemed to have some doubts; for he kept	on threatening that he would pull the ears of those responsible	for agricultural production.	3.8531214007801293
6312. and as we know the virgin lands are	not producing as much as khrushchev had hoped.	7.095718077364442
6313. one cannot	but wonder whether these doubts about the success of khrushchev's	agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the	big surprises provided by this congress- the obsessive harping on the	crimes and misdeeds of the anti-party group- molotov malenkov	kaganovich and others- including the eighty-year-old marshal	voroshilov.	3.3531242559901093
6314. molotov in particular is being charged with all kinds	of sins- especially with wanting to cut down free public services	to increase rents and fares; in fact with having been against all	the more popular features of the khrushchev welfare state.	4.7726881200130675
6315. the trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one	side of the story: what in the secret councils of the kremlin	molotov had really proposed we just don't know and he has had	no chance to reply.	3.3086399051195756
6316. but one cannot escape the suspicion	that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated	anti-party group would be totally unnecessary if there were not	inside the party some secret but genuine opposition to khrushchev on	vital doctrinal grounds on the actual methods to be employed in the	transition to communism and last but not least on foreign policy.	4.820637429560679
6317. the whole problem of peaceful coexistence and peaceful	competition with the capitalist world is in the very center of this	congress.	3.989560291449464
6318. mikoyan declared:   molotov altogether rejects	the line of peaceful coexistence reducing this concept merely to the	state of peace or rather the absence of war at a given moment and	to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war.	4.985828421073165
6319. his views in	fact coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence	who look upon it merely as a variant of the cold war or of an armed	peace.	3.6012985511457845
6320. one cannot help wondering whether molotov	and the rest of the anti-party group are not being used as china's	whipping-boys by khrushchev and his faithful followers.	5.7276695189900195
6321. for	something clearly has gone very very seriously wrong in soviet-chinese	relations which were never easy and have now deteriorated.	3.3722588572751357
6322. the effect of chou en-lai's clash with khrushchev together	with the everlasting attacks on molotov + co has shifted the whole	attention of the world including that of the soviet people from	the epoch-making twenty-year program to the present soviet-chinese	conflict.	5.223329516153336
6323. not only as we know did chou en-lai publicly treat	khrushchev's attack on albania as something that we cannot consider	as a serious marxist-leninist approach to the problem	but	the albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to	khrushchev calling him a liar a bully and so on.	3.458024864065776
6324. it is extremely	doubtful that the handful of albanians who call themselves communists	could have done this without the direct approval of their chinese friends.	5.20382534657196
6325. the big question is whether in the name of a restored chinese-soviet	solidarity the chinese will choose to persuade the albanians	to present their humble apologies to khrushchev- or get rid of	enver hoxa.	3.3077972309096433
6326. these seem about the only two ways in which the unhappy	incident can now be closed.	7.0560253518535125
6327. but albania is merely a symptom	of a real malaise between china and russia.	3.754916240062437
6328. khrushchev for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable	decay of capitalism is genuinely favorable to peaceful coexistence	and would like above all the berlin and german problems	to be settled peacefully; he knows that he was never more popular than	at the time of the russo-american honeymoon of 1959.	5.1388349388218435
6329. but	it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere- in the	first place from china but perhaps also from that china lobby	which i was assured in moscow nearly two years ago exists on	the quiet inside the party.	3.284348264653676
6330. to these people solidarity and unity with	china should be the real basis of russia's future policy.	5.734538291765638
6331. and the	chinese as the albanian incident shows have strong suspicions that	khrushchev is anxious to secure a shameful peace with the west.	3.3401011112133228
6332. the fact that china	should be supported by north korea and north	vietnam is highly indicative.	5.641513224232879
6333. and one cannot but wonder whether	marshal malinovsky	who was blowing hot and cold exalting peace but	also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against	the west wasn't trying to keep the chinese quiet.	3.3814256344839193
6334. and this	brings us inevitably to the 30-	or 50-megaton bomb.	5.8837583395362625
6335. was not this dropped	primarily in order to appease the chinese- especially after	khrushchev's humiliating surrender to the west in canceling	the german peace-treaty deadline of december 31?	3.667335662286485
6336.    what	does it all add up to?	7.195669668078802
6337.  indications are that khrushchev	favor peaceful coexistence and	the maintenance of the status quo in	the world.	3.7536200511841464
6338. the chinese north vietnamese and north koreans on	the other hand feel that militarily russia is strong enough to support	them in the just wars of liberation they would like to embark	on before long: with china attacking formosa and the north koreans	and north vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective	countries.	4.647579031307138
6339. perhaps khrushchev is in a more difficult	position than any since 1957 when the anti-party group nearly	liquidated him.	4.222864914175254
6340. he seems strong enough inside the party to cope with	any internal opposition; but if he is up against china's crusading	spirit in world affairs he is going to be faced with the most agonizing	choice in his life.	5.978133701992753
6341. he may support china; he	may break with china	or he may succeed by all kinds of dangerous concessions	in persuading china to be patient.	3.59282102032392
6342. the next days may show where things	stand.	6.0927238335516565
6343. on a misty sunday morning last month a small band of militant	anti-communists called the minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field	about fifteen miles east of here.	3.485592313321801
6344. eleven men a woman and a teen-age	boy tramped over cold damp fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour	field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare.	5.269821317367853
6345. to the average	american this must sound like an incredible tale from a saturday	night tv movie.	3.863678710946025
6346. but to the minutemen this is a serious business.	9.41026270700311
6347. they feel that the united states is engaged in a life-and-death	struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy.	4.772924222201686
6348. they feel	that world war 3 has already begun and they are setting themselves	up as a last line of defense against the communist advance.	5.472422916447031
6349. their national leader robert bolivar depugh of norborne	mo says the minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best	suited to defeat the red onslaught.	3.3054032852557165
6350. in their maneuvers last month	they wore world war 2 camouflage garb and helmets and carried unloaded	m-1 rifles.	5.590820481630204
6351. the maneuvers were held in secret	after a regional seminar for the minutemen held in nearby shiloh	ill had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs who had	arrested regional leader richard lauchli of collinsville ill	and seized four operative weapons including a browning machine gun	two browning automatic rifles and an m-4 rifle.	2.8086084255682655
6352. undismayed	by this contretemps a small band of the faithful gathered at lauchli's	home at 6:30 am the next day put on their uniforms	and headed for a farm several miles away.	5.089140255667446
6353. a 60 mm mortar and a	57 mm	recoilless rifle owned by lauchli were brought along.	3.3422584879483828
6354. the mortar	was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated.	4.710837720980214
6355. after a tortuous drive in an open truck and a world war	2 army jeep down soggy trails the band arrived at a small clearing	squeezed between a long low ridge and a creek-filled gully.	3.409202429733839
6356. here	the two leaders depugh and lauchli hastened to put the group	through its paces.	5.626559340453378
6357. the minutemen were instructed in the use	of terrain for concealment.	3.7727050522469807
6358. they were shown how to advance against an	enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge.	5.775659936675444
6359. they practiced movement behind a	smoke screen laid by smoke grenades; and they attempted a skirmish	line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment.	3.169439259436874
6360. eleven dummy	rounds were fired by lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar	shooting.	5.612365122388696
6361. mrs depugh the mother of five children and an	active member of her husband's organization participated in all the	exercises.	3.8269506543147096
6362. there were no casualties but the guerrillas	admitted to being a little tired when the leaders called	a halt at 9 am to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane.	5.31268005738779
6363. i would like to add one more practical reform	to those mentioned by russell kirk dec 16.	4.005292238859225
6364. it has to do	with teachers' salaries and tenure.	7.496903032966977
6365. next september after receiving	a degree from yale's master of arts in teaching program	i will be teaching somewhere- that much is guaranteed by the present	shortage of mathematics teachers.	3.311612395286362
6366. i will also be underpaid.	9.390687711538805
6367. the	amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers.	4.181376575452256
6368. teaching	is at present a sellers' market; as a result buyers the	public must be satisfied with second-rate teachers.	5.971375772683665
6369. but this is not	the real problem; the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually	paid on the basis of time served rather than quality.	4.054325665537221
6370. hence all	teachers good and bad who have been teaching for a given number of	years are paid the same salary.	6.069863131905754
6371. i am firmly convinced that considering	the average quality of teachers in this country the profession is grossly	overpaid.	4.285736871900535
6372. it follows that teachers as a group cannot expect	any marked salary increases; there is a limit to how much the public	will pay for shoddy performance.	6.033418281297226
6373. the only hope which good teachers	have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight	of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them.	3.2266520973252097
6374. the only hope which	the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis	of merit rather than tenure.	5.314772588989683
6375. here as in all sectors of the economy	quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual	to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses.	3.9889173237423625
6376. of initiative	on the eve of the great debate on the proposal	to give the president broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions	which could practically bring us into the atlantic community	we should face the alternatives on this proposition.	5.052100574633123
6377. what we will	be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective	which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which	we now operate.	3.558884433734137
6378. without this power we lay open any american industry	which the europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy	to the will of others.	5.390228206993245
6379. it is this loss of initiative in how we conduct	our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we	conduct our political affairs.	3.746742487115974
6380. i disagree with mr burnham's position on the common market	nov 18 as a desirable organization for us to join.	5.680623772010375
6381. for him to	ignore the political consequences involved in an atlantic union of	this kind is difficult to understand.	3.8880278323015642
6382. the pressure for our entry to	the common market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated	trade union by way of a purely economic thoroughfare or	garden path with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background.	4.7229025567378375
6383. the appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing	to those who do not see its relation to political and legal	as well as economic self-rule.	3.7713325119860093
6384. in entering this union we will be surrendering	most if not all of our economic autonomy to international	bodies such as the atlantic institute or the oecd	imf and others.	5.752952185599457
6385. to think that we can merely	relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political	or legal autonomy is wishful thinking.	3.8685093163733177
6386. if it is not enough that	all of our internationalist one worlders are advocating that we join	this market i refer you to an article in the new york times'	magazine section nov 12 1961 by mr eric johnston	entitled we must join the common market.	5.516641318630184
6387. he says: it	has swept aside petty nationalisms age-old rivalries and worn-out	customs.	3.4796816234696144
6388. referring to britain he says we see a nation that	traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its	economy placing this authority in continental hands.	5.422437432876429
6389. h since	the goal of our international planners is a world government this atlantic	community would mark a giant step in that direction for once	american economic autonomy is absorbed a larger grouping is a question	of time.	3.375908451677274
6390. frankly it is being very cleverly done for in a sense	they have us over a barrel.	5.984958875943868
6391. listen to what mr johnston has to	say: consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict.	3.459237246459501
6392. h we would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports	we need.	5.94907328757095
6393. we would be crippled by reduced output industrial decline	widespread unemployment.	4.403154445591403
6394. but the solution to this dilemma	is not the incorporation of the united states into an atlantic community	or economic empire but merely what libertarians like henry	hazlitt and ludwig von mises have been arguing for years: an	end to government regulations an end to government competition in industry	and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry.	4.651016467688926
6395. create a	free market here give us a sound debt-free money system and we'll	compete with anyone europe and asia combined.	3.353363317787655
6396. in short get this	governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won't have to worry about	european competition or communism either.	5.217484708769358
6397. if we want to preserve	our sovereignty this is the way to do it; not acquiesce to an international	planning board.	4.798890038203754
6398. if we go into this common market we might	just as well stop talking about constitutional guarantees connally	amendments or for that matter conservatism in general.	5.396759690114786
6399. we welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a many-sided	discussion of the atlantic common market which nr will	be continuing in our pages.	3.531134989215084
6400. the peiping chinese were the only major silver seller in the	world markets who stopped selling the metal on monday morning november	27 anticipating by two days the announcement of the us	treasury that the pegged offering price will be removed.	4.523461817664658
6401. and the army	in 1954 i was drafted and after serving two	years honorably on active duty i was not required to participate in	any further army reserve activities.	3.409296506874611
6402. now more than five years later	i cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier.	5.89301217465613
6403. but	in spite of this i at present a man 31 years of age and a college	professor have been recalled by direction of the president	to report on november 25th to fort devens massachusetts for another	twelve months of active duty as an sp 4	.	3.4277691799190393
6404. today seven years after the date of my initial induction	as a draftee i am assistant professor of philosophy and science	at st michael's college.	5.218872024869624
6405. for after leaving the army in 1956	i spent five years in graduate school first at boston college	and then at the university of toronto.	3.8590366269527374
6406. this time added to that which	i had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954 makes	a total of twenty-two years of education.	5.216718995213742
6407. the possibility	of recall into the army is part of the price that a modern american	has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys.	3.827316734678882
6408. with	this no loyal citizen can quarrel.	6.8927906044940945
6409. however it seems axiomatic that	the government has an obligation to exercise its mandate reasonably	equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably	causes.	3.541793467783861
6410. in my own case i submit that such reasonable and fair	exercise is woefully lacking.	6.021569572915808
6411. taken back into the army now as an	sp 4 i am leaving 110 college students whose teacher i am.	3.77085874196544
6412. wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from	at this late date it is	impossible for st michael's college to find a suitable replacement	for me.	5.4048895830809425
6413. even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal	life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very	compelling reason- i cannot help looking around at the black leather	jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns	of every american city and asking myself if our society has gone	mad.	3.5314191831683193
6414. in news broadcasts i consistently	hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the katanga army	referred to as mercenaries.	5.327914157584764
6415. this confuses me no end.	4.665249289439083
6416. if the hessian	troops sent here willy-nilly by the hessian government to fight for	england in the 1770's were mercenaries what shall we call the un	troops sent to the congo willy-nilly by their governments to	fight for the united nations?	5.001097824895482
6417.  if the un troops are not mercenaries	then the hessians were not mercenaries either.	3.9431085975423876
6418. and if the foreigners	fighting in the katanga army are mercenaries then lafayette	and von steuben were mercenaries too as were also the members of the	lafayette escadrille in the early part of world war 1 and of	chennault's flying tigers in the early days of world war 2.	5.9524138207436925
6419. it doesn't take a gore vidal to tell you	what's wrong with cherokee textile's slogan pitney-bowes	objects july 1.	3.4651091323926373
6420. it's an eighteenth-century negative man!	suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment:  by moving	the term republic to lower case substituting the modern	phrase move ahead for the stodgy keep and by using the postmaster's	name on every envelope	the slogan cannot fail.	4.301732956842859
6421. impending death of pope	in the issue of march 5 1960 you had an	excellent editorial which said:   on trial in jakarta for	having flown for the indonesian anti-communist insurgents	us	pilot alan lawrence pope boldly told the court that in supporting	the freedom fighters he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence	of indonesia.	2.891662270607095
6422. facing a prosecution which has demanded the	death penalty he said: 'i have participated in the war against	communism in korea and at dienbienphu and i have helped in the evacuation	of north vietnamese to the free world.	5.041094455663653
6423. i have done all this	for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states	which have been threatened by communist domination'.	3.90164556526322
6424. at least in	indonesia khrushchev found an american proud to be at total war with	communism!   since then nothing has happened to save the	life of pope.	5.699983080618942
6425. i found recently a very small article in the new	york times:   us	flier loses plea.	4.160560478855963
6426. indonesia court	upholds pope's death sentence.	7.3491509635620424
6427. indonesia military supreme	court has confirmed the death sentence passed on alan lawrence	pope an american pilot.	3.6383910183399237
6428. pope was convicted last year of having aided	north celebes rebels by flying bombing missions.	5.543784224776332
6429. he has been in	prison since may 1958 when his aircraft was shot down over moluccas.	4.046280770084297
6430. he may appeal to president sukarno for clemency.	7.030027214566518
6431. as	we see pope may appeal to president sukarno khrushchev's friend	for clemency.	3.698410809587171
6432. this possibility is anything but reassuring.	7.080576420503722
6433. the eleanor roosevelt tractor committee acts on behalf of the cuban	freedom fighters.	3.52079527800884
6434. but who will act now and immediately to save the	life of alan pope?	6.180685038421751
6435.  are tractors available for him?	5.945793491459674
6436.  does anybody	think of saving the life of an anti-communist american pilot?	7.082513555403779
6437. 	a few days before i saw your mention of what texas	liberals were doing to promote louis capet the week	june 3 another analogy had occurred to me.	3.160173237198191
6438. consider	this table:  louis 14- fdr.	6.50129772493279
6439. h with no strong	men and no parliament to dispute his will he was the government.	4.323520314580511
6440. a 'dust-settling' period	of decadence and decline.	6.031148443921851
6441. h he opened his mouth said little and thought not at all.	4.3002209448880375
6442. h not completely virtuous	but completely incompetent.	7.329914706352198
6443. and marie antoinette- jacqueline	bouvier.	5.311971472199445
6444. h the beautiful and light-hearted.	9.051105561811351
6445. french revolution- conservative revolution?	4.904063420843623
6446.    truly	that liberals should choose louis 14 as a bogey-symbol of conservatism	is grotesquely ironic considering the louis 14 character	of their grand monarque fdr: not only in his accretion of absolute	power and personal deification	but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies.	4.441798973032441
6447. in defeating louis capet john tower's victory in	texas signals once again the end of the divine right of liberalism.	3.8724622024380295
6448. it seems to me that nc in his editorial	confrontation sr mar 25 has hit upon the real	problem that bothers all of us in a complex world: how do we retain	our personal relationship with those who suffer?	5.419634639584704
6449.  this affects us	all intimately and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress.	3.850513034676881
6450. i know of no other solution than the one nc proposes-	to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us hoping that	this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place.	5.36052778640638
6451. never	have i seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically.	3.8455925734478456
6452. thank you for the illustrated editorial confrontation.	7.047427135491323
6453. it is both great writing and profound religion.	4.3710713682863185
6454. nc	has said something important so well that this preacher	will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece.	5.429855099861369
6455. i	feel that nc hit the very core of our existence in the editorial	confrontation.	3.7774946523106876
6456. personally it meant a great deal; my	only hope is that it will be shared by many many others.	6.465629084088033
6457. confrontation	should fortify us all whether in southeast	asia or the us.	3.9144545404388986
6458. congratulations to nc	for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the	peace corps.	6.125395546593654
6459. i concur that it is necessary for americans to have	a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands.	4.418171923159087
6460. it would	be heartbreaking to see idealism and hence effective leadership thwarted	by the poverty and hardship which young americans will run into.	5.0385278382479735
6461. the editorial confrontation was certainly direct	in its appear to those of us living here in america.	3.7744590772212736
6462. i personally	gained strength from it.	7.62233762876887
6463. thanks for continuing to capture the attention	and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world.	3.8497957154740874
6464. nc's editorial confrontation is a stunning piece	of writing.	6.050931081358854
6465. i would hope that sargent shriver will encourage everyone	entering the peace corps to read it.	4.090611053753324
6466. the important people to	humanity are not the khrushchevs and the castros h but the schweitzers	and the dooleys and the others like them whose names we will	never know.	5.011039248642869
6467. editor's note: reprints of confrontation	will be included among the material to be distributed to	members of the peace corps.	3.5624746000168694
6468. a peace corps official described the	editorial as precisely the message we need to communicate to the	men and women who will soon be peace corps volunteers.	5.308381634301144
6469. bostonian?	7.781497302878112
6470. 	f l lucas's article in sr's	april 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the	new english bible.	5.6299595077611935
6471. i certainly hope this will be the impression left	in the minds of readers rather than the comment by cleveland amory	in his first of the month column.	4.489685649030394
6472. it is blind fundamentalist	dogmatism to say messing around with the king james version	h seems to us a perilous sport at best.	5.629012204244964
6473. lester markel is on the right track in his article interpretation	of interpretation	sr mar 11.	4.490569848268761
6474. the current stereotype	of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting	the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored	fact fancy and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished	in this country more than a generation ago.	4.5023664765735
6475. we don't	need this type of protection any more.	4.856437523556919
6476. the public is now armed with	sophistication and numerous competing media.	5.809748885899594
6477. besides there are no	longer enough corruptible journalists about.	4.397933830903198
6478. the accepted method	of writing news has two major liabilities.	5.06668722358371
6479. first it does not communicate.	6.9676209222428485
6480. a reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements	of both sides in a major labor dispute for instance is unable to tell	his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute.	5.204986362725634
6481. second it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous.	4.214558553600422
6482. the	charges by the late junior senator from wisconsin not only destroyed	innocent people but misled the nation.	5.325796367781465
6483. yet the press was powerless	to put these charges in perspective in its news columns.	4.132312188886829
6484. despite several	years of front-page stories the average citizen was unable to get	a complete picture of mccarthy until he saw on the television screen	what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way	of communicating.	5.026043301657643
6485. the senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions.	3.925483196108368
6486. it seems to me the time has come for the american	press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will	do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by	those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve	their own ends.	5.256336117702004
6487. the objective should be to provide a method of getting	into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant	information in the possession of reporters and editors.	3.341840708559293
6488. i would like to see you devote	some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning president	kennedy's activities so far as southern california is concerned.	5.800616990098523
6489. you have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised	press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent	opinions.	4.676451255545571
6490. to begin with the all-powerful los angeles times	does not publish a transcript of these press conferences.	5.544914401378441
6491. i	am sure that they did when eisenhower was president.	4.444839278337639
6492. next	because of the time differential the conferences come on the networks	during the middle of the day.	6.265401859438235
6493. up until now the networks have grudgingly	run half-hour tapes at 5 pm or sometimes 7 or 10:30 pm.	3.4856322300989016
6494. even then a few of the less interesting questions are	edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator.	6.36469419755036
6495. however last night	the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got	on tv were a few snatches which douglas edwards and huntley	and brinkley could squeeze into their programs.	3.2416373813171107
6496. this is no criticism	of them as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute	news summary.	5.7476379017149934
6497. the radio stations did run transcripts	during the evening hours.	3.639968761993641
6498. however by comparing	the tv snatches two different radio station re-runs and the censored	los angeles times version i found that the radio stations	had edited out questions	or even a paragraph out of the middle of the president's answer.	5.353421885660476
6499. i am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country	about the abuse he is being subjected to.	4.148206625141188
6500. we out here don't	see enough of the conference to know he is being abused.	6.457697210804083
6501. i don't	know if this is the situation in other parts of the country; apparently	it is not.	4.653632610610483
6502. it also happened with the inauguration which was	not re-run at all during the evening hours and i wrote to the tv	editor of the times.	5.426354621081391
6503. he did mention in his column the fact that	he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand	the networks and the independent local stations' not doing this-	but nothing happened.	3.338050929793611
6504. can you bring the networks' attention	to this?	7.4436271494138655
6505. 	i was interested	in james webb young's madison avenue column in which	he raised the question do we need a college of propaganda?	3.436154698337584
6506. 	sr feb 11.	7.9068494396104985
6507. in my estimation we definitely	do; and the sad part of it is that we had one which was rounding into	excellent shape and we let it disintegrate and die.	4.034355993405055
6508. during	the war we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare	which included the teaching of propaganda both black and white and the	various shades of grey in between.	5.372912059945412
6509. we had a couple of schools in this	country the principal one being on the marshall field estate out	in lloyd's neck.	4.018356398037532
6510. there were also a couple in canada and several	in england.	6.894993749644694
6511. the english schools preceded ours and by the time we	got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda	and its teaching.	3.7182957112709256
6512. four of us here in the united states attended	first as students then as instructors almost every one of these	schools in england canada and the united states.	6.487051283354468
6513. we set up	the lloyd's neck school worked out its curriculum and taught there.	3.7971898045893955
6514. toward the end of the war we really felt that we had learned something	about propaganda and how to teach it.	6.442685928935933
6515. when the end did	come and the schools were disbanded and abandoned we felt and hoped	that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust.	3.815134780247745
6516. we hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some	sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year	or so.	5.020180933325319
6517. alas no such thing happened.	5.270955537812732
6518. there apparently is no school of	propaganda or psychological warfare.	6.916630293612182
6519. a study at the pentagon and at	the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there.	3.8052920780716577
6520. and	not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been	called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way.	6.222133297327961
6521. congratulations	on the article do we need a college of propaganda?	4.4420305000541775
6522. 	this is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this	critical field in years and i certainly hope it sparks some action.	5.677855095988804
6523. many of us in public	relations were flattered that richard l tobin chose to devote his	editorial in the march 11 communications supplement to the merger	of the public relations society of america and the american public	relations association.	3.625554985045974
6524. i was surprised and sorry to find in your issue	of march 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet	been published.	5.729764206777246
6525. whether in his forthcoming book c p snow	commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily	autobiographical critic charged him is important.	3.6483412464599008
6526. one should be able	to get hold of the book at once.	6.911700776622839
6527. but the attack was made from an advance	copy.	4.97427362297598
6528. if this practice should take root and spread the man who	submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before	he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality.	5.199361429801662
6529. editor's note: sir robert watson-watt	wrote on page 50 of sr research for 4 march 1961: i	have read an advance copy of the snow book which is to be titled 'science	and government'.	3.2045715143993525
6530. until the work actually appears i am	not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail.	5.88761823222038
6531. but i have compared	its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of godkin	lectures at harvard from which the book was derived and i can	with confidence challenge the gist of c p snow's incautious	tale.	3.342698048238758
6532. watson-watt's remarks in sr did not then	constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the godkin lectures.	5.69261079347055
6533. representatives of harvard university press which is publishing	the book this month of april recognize and freely acknowledge	that they invited such reaction by allowing life magazine to print	an excerpt from the book in advance of the book's publication date.	3.1155838738717883
6534. the text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the	prepublication excerpt.	5.231909307011535
6535. sir robert watson-watt's rebuttal	of sir charles snow's godkin lectures is marred throughout	by too forceful a desire to defend lindemann and apparently himself	from sir charles' supposed falsehoods while stating those falsehoods	in an unclear incoherent argument.	2.953846696516343
6536. the article	presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning.	5.1895945919226385
6537. it calls the	conclusion admitted valid by historians and military strategists alike	a perverted conclusion.	3.6799616982445196
6538. it submits	an enthusiastic impressionistic conception of lindemann contributing	another aspect of the man but on no more authoritative basis than sir	charles' account.	5.621081038614416
6539. we are left to choose between the two lindemanns.	5.959471478229491
6540. the only fact that holds any weight in the article is the	result of the tea party.	5.420613387657003
6541. but we are to believe that lindemann actively	supported radar outside the tizard committee and dissembling	discounted it inside?	4.329760553306046
6542.  if so i would lean to sir charles' conception	of the man.	6.6319640151494275
6543. i think it was a grave error to print the	article at this time.	4.807902551402201
6544. to the unfortunate people unable to attend the	godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the	book which may dissuade some people from reading it.	4.883241412446594
6545. it is not news that nathan milstein is a wizard of the	violin.	4.16356592707821
6546. certainly not in orchestra hall where he has played countless	recitals and where thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with	the chicago symphony orchestra playing the brahms concerto with	his own slashing demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high pale	pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music	or forever finds it closed.	4.709212799696082
6547. there was about that song something	incandescent for this brahms was milstein at white heat.	4.083763266798529
6548. not	the noblest performance we have heard him play or the most spacious	or even the most eloquent.	5.629912900167192
6549. those would be reserved for the orchestra's	great nights when the soloist can surpass himself.	4.029649297863679
6550. this time the	orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own	high mood.	5.6068774465620255
6551. but he had in walter hendl a willing conductor able only	up to a point.	4.223736413042032
6552. that is when mr milstein thrust straight	to the core of the music sparks flying bow shredding violin singing	glittering and sometimes spitting mr hendl could go along.	5.3441790165318865
6553. but	mr hendl does not go straight to any point.	4.208747559331716
6554. he flounders and	lets music sprawl.	6.887174422376562
6555. there was in the brahms none of the mysterious and	marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist orchestra	and music to ultimate fusion.	4.0526242241878485
6556. so we had some dazzling and memorable	milstein but not great brahms.	6.475741613672964
6557. the concert opened with	another big romantic score schumann's overture to manfred	which suffered fate this time with orchestral thrusts to the byronic	point to keep it afloat.	3.1303912294289455
6558. hindemith's joust with weber tunes was	a considerably more serious misfortune for it demands transluscent	textures buoyant rhythms and astringent wit.	4.600490417168352
6559. it got the kind of scrambled	coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when	the man with the baton lacks technique and style.	3.827789219447262
6560. summer	the bayreuth festival opens july 23 with a new production	of tannhaeuser staged by wieland wagner who is doing all the	operas this time and conducted by wolfgang sawallisch.	4.733415743452088
6561. sawalisch	also conducts the flying dutch opening july 24.	3.914764946418777
6562. parsifal	follows july 25 with hans knappertsbusch conducting and he	also conducts die meistersinger to be presented aug 8 and	12.	4.835149464236032
6563. the ring cycles are july 26 27 28 and 30 and aug	21 22 23 and 25.	3.135433823729296
6564. no casts are listed but	lotte lehmann sent word that the negro soprano grace bumbry will	sing venus in tannhaeuser.	5.2001890959900425
6565. remember how by a series of booking absurdities chicago	missed seeing the bolshoi ballet?	4.0612087743826075
6566.  remember how by lack of two big	theaters chicago missed the first visit of the royal danish ballet?	5.4491005639217835
6567. 	well now we have two big theaters.	4.73358350619292
6568. but barring a miracle and	don't hold your breath for it chicago will not see the leningrad-kirov	ballet which stems from the ballet cradle of the maryinsky and	is one of the great companies of the world.	5.441455382538456
6569. before you let	loose a howl saying we announced its coming not once but several times	indeed we did.	3.5739490550612696
6570. the engagement was supposed to be all set for the big	theater in mccormick place which sol hurok ballet booker extraordinary	considers the finest house of its kind in the country- and	of course he doesn't weep at the capacity either.	4.53913610164634
6571. allied arts corporation first listed the chicago dates	as dec 4 thru 10.	3.8012087367900396
6572. later the hurok office made it dec 8 thru	17 a nice long booking for the full repertory.	5.822502311737389
6573. but if you keep a calendar	of events as we do you noticed a conflict.	4.305483203822423
6574. allied arts had	booked marlene dietrich into mccormick place dec 8 and 9.	5.528334082733536
6575. not la dietrich.	7.023137867924893
6576. allied arts then notified	us that the kirov would cut short its los angeles booking fly here	to open nov 28 and close dec 2.	4.786640599253875
6577. shorter booking but still	a booking.	4.579814444911634
6578. a couple of days later a balletomane	told me he had telephoned allied arts for ticket information and was	told the newspapers had made a mistake.	5.238154223506659
6579. so i started making	some calls of my own.	4.880352995057501
6580. the kirov ballet	is firmly booked into the shrine auditorium los angeles nov	21 thru dec 4.	4.617668892426824
6581. not a chance of opening here nov 28-	barring that miracle.	4.691648190918143
6582. then why not the juicy booking hurok had held	for us?	6.100601780508679
6583.  well dietrich won't budge from mccormick place.	4.634300435489061
6584. then	how about the civic opera house?	6.545861026160313
6585.  well allied arts has booked	lena horne there for a week starting dec 4.	4.289337224502951
6586. queried about	the impasse allied arts said: better cancel the kirov for	the time being.	5.057856519535358
6587. it's all up in the air again.	5.883383147290653
6588. so the kirov	will fly back to russia minus a chicago engagement a serious	loss for dance fans- and for the frustrated bookers cancellation of	one of the richest bookings in the country.	5.140754860368305
6589. will somebody please	reopen the auditorium?	5.462570748116222
6590. 	paintings and drawings by marie moore of st thomas virgin	islands are shown thru nov 5 at the meadows gallery 3211	ellis av week days 3 p m to 8 p m sundays 3 p m	to 6 p m closed mondays.	4.400896533170556
6591. an exhibition of	evelyn cibula's paintings will open with a reception nov 5 at	the evanston community center 828 davis st.	3.450905893038903
6592. it will continue all	month.	11.25740196215758
6593. abstractions and semi-abstractions by everett mcnear	are being exhibited by the university gallery of notre dame	until nov 5.	3.2422999641276196
6594. in the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget the dallas	civic opera will use san francisco's new leni bauer-ecsy	production of lucia di lammermoor this season returning the favor	next season when san francisco uses the dallas don giovanni	designed by franco zeffirelli.	4.510512143710053
6595. h e bates has scribbled a farce called hark hark	the lark! it is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible	novels of the season.	3.6941453924192276
6596. if there is a moral lurking among the	shenanigans it is hard to find.	7.921543736873265
6597. perhaps the lesson we should take from	these pages is that the welfare state in england still allows wild	scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics.	4.0577435691348205
6598. anyway a number of	them meet here in devastating collisions.	5.9893560220060085
6599. one is an imperial london	stockbroker called jerebohm.	5.223370663195646
6600. another is a wily countryman called larkin	whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled i believe	in earlier volumes of mr bates' comedie humaine.	4.73653013992017
6601. what's	up now?	6.235438618222183
6602.  well jerebohm and his wife pinkie have reached the	stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive	rustic simplicities.	5.564842187258467
6603. they want to own a junior-grade castle	or a manor house or some modest little place where shakespeare might	once have staged a pageant for great elizabeth and all her bearded	courtiers.	3.2143177650596075
6604. they are willing to settle however in anything	that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at.	5.706803686776677
6605. and of course	larkin has just the thing they want.	4.66479359532643
6606. the name of it is gore court and it is surrounded	by a wasteland that would impress t s eliot.	6.08430674204463
6607. that's not	precisely the way larkin urges them to look at it though.	4.444940197922723
6608. he conjures	herds	of deer and wild birds crowding the air.	5.756901530812683
6609. he suggests	that gore court embodies all the glories of tudor splendor.	3.6561514059851796
6610. the stained-glass	windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas the paneling	may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform.	4.887416138647139
6611. the vast dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions	when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch.	3.1157346896677103
6612. larkin has an answer to all that.	6.917779164000633
6613. the spaciousness of the tudor	cooking areas for example will provide needed space for the extra	television sets required by modern butlers cooks and maids.	3.0238668805030655
6614. also perhaps	table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented.	6.064208360983228
6615. it's a wonder really to how much mendacious trouble	larkin puts himself to sell the jerebohms that preposterous manse.	3.6793490095716757
6616. he doesn't really need the immense sum of money	he makes them pay.	5.454042783680371
6617. for larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot.	4.387304766009366
6618. he has	a glorious wife and many children.	6.704695092333511
6619. when he needs money to buy something	like say the rolls-royce he keeps near his vegetable patch he	takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies.	3.5836477014898667
6620. one of those capital-gains	ventures in fact has saddled him with gore court.	6.610269384101138
6621. he is	willing to sell it just to get it off his hands.	4.4523532971021424
6622. and the jerebohms	are more than willing to buy it.	6.91421321726247
6623. they plan to become county people	who know the proper way to terminate a fox's life on earth.	3.6193470864563047
6624. one then the other	if in larkin's eyes they are nothing	but piccadilly farmers he has as much to learn about them as they	have to learn about the ways of truly rural living.	5.241773637466249
6625. mr bates	shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc.	3.858425854211741
6626. oneupmanship	is practiced by both sides in a total war.	6.444914738890874
6627. first	the larkins are ahead then the jerebohms.	4.42210761443543
6628. after larkin has been persuaded	to restock his tangled acres with pheasants he poaches only what	he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers.	5.121200718777509
6629. one	of the local callers a retired brigadier apparently left over from kipling's	tales of india does not approve of the way larkin gets	his birds.	3.684167979543165
6630. he doesn't think that potting them from a deck chair	on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance	is entirely sporting.	5.692304632128362
6631. but the brigadier dines on the birds with	relish.	4.5714099775326344
6632. it is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive	film yet made from miguel de cervantes' don quixote	is the brilliant russian spectacle done in wide screen and color	which opened yesterday at the fifty-fifth street and sixty-eighth street	playhouses.	4.517741327564975
6633. more than a beautiful visualization of the	illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant	and his squire sancho panza in seventeenth-century spain this inevitably	abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an	affectingly warm and human exposition of character.	3.0883341245850375
6634. nikolai	cherkasov the russian actor who has played such heroic roles as alexander	nevsky and ivan the terrible performs the lanky don quixote	and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility	and the surface absurdity of this poignant man.	4.454782768611655
6635. his addle-brained	knight-errant self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an	age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous	code of knight-errantry had become a joke is as cervantes no doubt	intended a gaunt but gracious symbol of good moving soberly and sincerely	in a world of cynics hypocrites and rogues.	2.9669906123650622
6636. cherkasov	does not caricature him as some actors have been inclined to do.	5.476979534096998
6637. he	treats this deep-eyed bearded bony crackpot with tangible affection	and respect.	3.472634548144582
6638. directed by grigory kozintsev in a tempo that is	studiously	slow he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and	passing gravely through an impious world.	5.023117275047143
6639. the complexities	of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately	stilted english language that has been excellently dubbed in	place of the russian dialogue.	3.473995428400738
6640. the voices of all the characters including	that of cherkasov have richness roughness or color to conform	with the personalities.	4.956941656060934
6641. and the subtleties of the dialogue are most	helpfully conveyed.	5.040455502035874
6642. since russian was being spoken instead of spanish	there is no violation of artistry or logic here.	5.373733333023133
6643. splendid	too is the performance of yuri tolubeyev one of russia's leading	comedians as sancho panza the fat grotesque squire.	3.38973607487774
6644. though	his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don	he gives it a firmness and toughness- a sort of peasant dignity-	too.	5.03038298058069
6645. it is really as though the russians have seen in this character	the	oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons.	3.799275844896664
6646. the episode in which sancho panza concludes the joke that is played	on him when he is facetiously put in command of an island is	one of the best in the film.	5.33502480131699
6647. true the pattern and flow of	the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in	the first half before don quixote goes to the duke's court.	3.574983404194344
6648. but	strength and poignancy develop thenceforth and the windmill and deathbed	episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of	the old boy.	4.682025486366721
6649. there are other good representations of peasants	and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently	photographed in this last of the russian films to reach this	country in the program of joint cultural exchange.	3.7755667183272776
6650. also on the	bill at the fifty-fifth street is a nice ten-minute color film called	sunday in greenwich village a tour of the haunts and joints.	5.284763622342264
6651. television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz	which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member	of the family.	3.630644034276944
6652. there seems to be an unfortunate assumption	that an hour of chicago-style jazz in prime evening time for example	could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary.	5.64832737113173
6653. at least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for chicago	and all that jazz presented on nbc-tv nov	26.	4.604760892150076
6654. the program came out of the nbc special projects department	and was slotted in the du pont show of the week series.	5.762658425174459
6655. perhaps special projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines.	4.517419044688161
6656. if so it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different	department- one with enough confidence in the musical material	to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room	to display their talents.	5.721041759450672
6657. as a matter of fact this latter approach	has already been tried and with pleasing results.	4.3419619246970065
6658. a few years	ago a	timex all-star jazz show offered a broad range of styles	ranging from lionel hampton's big band to the free-wheeling	dukes of dixieland.	5.043077668148473
6659. an enthusiastic audience confirmed the live	character of the hour and provided the interaction between musician	and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance.	3.5529022673316133
6660. about that same time john crosby's tv series	on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space	is one of the most sensible things a producer can do.	5.2423690008897506
6661. in an hour remembered	for its almost rudderless movement a score of jazz luminaries	went before the cameras for lengthy periods.	3.766643805680158
6662. the program had been arranged	to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration	on the music.	5.560346764920259
6663. cameras stared at soloists' faces in extreme closeups	then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work.	3.27716069051589
6664. chicago and all that jazz could not be faulted on the choice	of artists.	6.379859242382333
6665. some of the in-person performers were jack teagarden	gene krupa bud freeman pee wee russell johnny st cyr	joe sullivan red allen lil armstrong blossom seeley.	3.1394410405909885
6666. the	jazz buff could hardly ask for more.	6.341160181359005
6667. furthermore garry moore	makes an ideal master of ceremonies.	4.392843348304192
6668. one of the script's big problems	was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances	by musicians of today.	5.645152028448205
6669. nbc had gathered a lot of historical material	which it was eager to share.	4.266785567422324
6670. for example there was sheet music	with the word jazz in the title	to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold.	5.542067766779147
6671. samples	soomed into closeup range in regular succession like telephone poles	passing on the highway while representative music reinforced the mood	of the late teens and 1920's.	3.0565679930012695
6672. however well chosen and cleverly	arranged such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an	interruption than an auxiliary to the evening's main business which	should probably have been the gathering	of fresh samples of the chicago style.	4.980455908579012
6673. another source of	nbc pride was its rare film clip of bix beiderbecke but this	view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would	have blotted out the entire glimpse.	3.2262683559835246
6674. similarly in presenting still	photographs of early jazz groups the program allowed no time for a	close perusal.	5.446054058522884
6675. chicago and all that jazz may have wound	up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer.	3.524702384051576
6676. by trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase	for today's artists the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect	example of either.	5.595835461970884
6677. still the network's willingness to experiment	in this musical field is to be commended and future essays happily	anticipated.	4.014828057319899
6678. even joan sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous	reception she received from the metropolitan opera audience attending	her debut as lucia in donizetti's lucia di lammermoor sunday	night.	5.097775018033168
6679. the crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of	cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as miss sutherland	took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic mad	scene created on her own and with the help of the composer and the	other performers.	3.20720884606592
6680. her entrance in scene 2 act 1 brought some	disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note.	5.255848928071706
6681. thereafter	the audience waxed applause-happy but discriminating operagoers reserved	judgment as her singing showed signs of strain her musicianship	some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization.	2.9610703079037326
6682. as she gained composure during the second act her technical resourcefulness	emerged stronger though she had already revealed a trill almost	unprecedented in years of performances of lucia.	5.23019462256604
6683. she topped	the sextet brilliantly.	5.503310575060637
6684. each high note had the crowd in ecstasy	so that it stopped the show midway in the mad scene but the	real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding	at the moment.	5.0486006696408365
6685. miss sutherland appeared almost as another person	in this scene: a much more girlish lucia a sensational coloratura	who ran across stage while singing and an actress immersed in her	role.	3.223504154183106
6686. what followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as	miss sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among	sopranos today.	4.921963497490243
6687. this big flexible voice with uncommon range	has been superbly disciplined.	3.6365997550644678
6688. nervousness at the start must have caused	the blemishes of her first scene or she may warm up slowly.	5.437764888427881
6689. in	the fullness of her vocal splendor however she could sing the famous	scene magnificently.	3.8025887550090722
6690. technically it was fascinating aurally	spell-binding and dramatically quite realistic.	5.85711308438589
6691. many years have passed	since a metropolitan audience heard anything comparable.	4.376773939628505
6692. her debut	over perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine.	6.206665752627615
6693. the	performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor	silvio varviso.	3.631264215435208
6694. he injected more vitality into the score than	it has revealed in many years.	5.5221039326397845
6695. he may respect too much the italian tradition	of letting singers hold on to their notes but to restrain them	in a singers' opera may be quite difficult.	3.4256452336867165
6696. richard tucker	sang edgardo in glorious voice.	6.931833348363946
6697. his bel canto style gave the performance	a special distinction.	3.894040438959646
6698. the remainder of the cast fulfilled its	assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and	limited stage direction proved only serviceable.	5.518921305628863
6699. miss sutherland	first sang lucia at covent garden in 1959.	4.195258574028514
6700. she	has since turned to bellini whose opera beatrice di tenda	in a concert version with the american opera society introduced her	to new york last season.	4.707238896415041
6701. she will sing la sonambula with	it here next week.	4.343455364932992
6702. anyone for musical ping-pong?	8.578179420247961
6703.    it's really quite fun-	as long as you like games.	4.214828791206925
6704. you will need a stereo music system	with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart and	one or more of the new london phase 4 records.	6.15662623203739
6705. there are 12	of these to choose from all of them of popular music except for the	star release.	4.192656658250465
6706. this features	the marching songs of several nations recorded as though the various	national bands were marching by your reviewing stand.	5.00268812365005
6707. complete with	crowd effects interruptions by jet planes and sundry other touches of	realism this disc displays london's new technique to the best effect.	3.149408424384874
6708. all of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed	explanation of this new recording program.	6.6280030440898186
6709. no reference is made to the	possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner and	it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music.	3.806628352265696
6710. directionality	is greatly exaggerated most of the time; but when the sounds of	the two speakers are allowed to mix there is excellent depth and dimension	to the music.	5.289838897407306
6711. you definitely hear some of the instruments close	up and others farther back with the difference in placement apparently	more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely	being louder than the ones farther back.	3.603495370072696
6712. this is a characteristic of	good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural	sound.	6.638957470598609
6713. london explains that the very distinct directional	effect in the phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods	of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape	channels.	3.428436884888057
6714. these are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active	co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two	channels which are impressed on the record.	5.096186148563564
6715. in some of the numbers	the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and	then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects.	3.7042849080806177
6716. some clue to the character of london's approach in these discs	may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include	the word percussion or percussive.	5.427536138569214
6717. drums xylophones	castanets and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably	well.	3.8153354353929636
6718. only too often however you have the feeling that you are sitting	in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your	left and others facing them on the wall to your right.	6.122289432063122
6719. they are definitely	in the same room with you but your head starts to swing as	though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a	spirited volley.	3.5040843239480015
6720. stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day and johnny	keating's kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in percussive	moods	seemed one of the least attractive discs- the arrangements just	didn't have so much character as the others.	4.814750216285655
6721. there is an extraordinary	sense of presence in all of these recordings apparently obtained	at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies.	4.114588453836969
6722. the penalty for this is noticeable in the big bold brilliant	but brassy piano sounds in	.	5.274060993122257
6723. all of the releases however are recorded at a	gratifyingly high level with resultant masking of any surface noise.	3.8697902044078596
6724. practically guarantees enjoyment and is a dramatic	demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system.	5.921573363174492
6725. many hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic but not	realistic.	4.172396038519164
6726. strange but true- authenticity and realism often	aren't related at all.	5.464324534513327
6727. almost every film bearing the imprimatur	of hollywood is physically authentic- in fact impeccably so.	3.734176448143248
6728. in	any given period piece the costumes bric-a-brac vehicles and decor	bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity.	5.015340972414037
6729. the major studios	maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who	look to this matter.	3.300633903538383
6730. during the making recently of an important biblical	film some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only	of costumes and interiors but of architectural developments sports	arenas vehicles and other paraphernalia were compiled consulted and	complied with.	4.65074900560536
6731. but alas the authenticity seems to stop at	the set's edge.	3.9995049184557914
6732. the drama itself- and this seems to be lavishly true	of biblical drama- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity	at all.	5.0716062454072235
6733. the storyline in sort is wildly unrealistic.	3.5437132290213715
6734. thus in the story of ruth we have ruth naomi and boaz	and sets that are meticulously authentic.	5.894559967986059
6735. but except for a vague adherence	to the basic storyline- ie that ruth remained with naomi	and finally wound up with boaz- the film version has little to	do with the bible.	3.345507000878927
6736. and in the new king of kings the	plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to	the gospels.	5.940294392057956
6737. earlier this month edward r murrow director	of the united states information agency came to hollywood and	had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry.	4.078860331678814
6738. he talked about unauthentic storylines too.	6.9910641462573375
6739. he intimated that	they weren't doing the country much good in the cold war.	4.039877012036378
6740. and	to an industry that prides itself on authenticity he urged greater realism.	5.597105524224653
6741. in many corners of the globe he said the major	source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet.	4.274987265976606
6742. would we want a future-day gibbon or macaulay recounting the saga	of america with movies as his prime source of knowledge?	5.149472799357606
6743.  yet for	much of the globe hollywood is just that- prime if not sole source	of knowledge.	3.9007442587986865
6744. if a man totally ignorant of america were to judge	our land and its civilization based on hollywood alone what conclusions	do you think he might come to?	5.342816744898444
6745. 	francois d'albert hungarian-born violinist who made his	new york debut three years ago played a return engagement last night	in judson hall.	3.3895707834053925
6746. he is now president of the chicago conservatory	college.	10.30804457243282
6747. his pianist was donald jenni a faculty member at depaul	university.	3.924107022982518
6748. the acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged	by the artists so that for the first half of the program when	the	piano was partially open mr jenni's playing was too loud.	5.47958969745701
6749. in	vying with him mr d'albert also seemed to be overdriving his	tone.	4.160954325933303
6750. this was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the	performances however except in the case of the opening work mozart's	sonata in a which clattered along noisily in	an unrelieved fashion.	5.688180106217423
6751. brahm's sonata in a although also	vigorous stood up well under the two artists' strong large-scale	treatment.	3.4873664346060727
6752. mr d'albert has a firm attractive tone which eschews	an overly sweet vibrato.	5.5329896275947545
6753. he made the most of the long brahmsian	phrases and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work	a handsome performance.	4.285758720097181
6754. a sonata for violin and piano called	bella bella by robert fleming was given its first united	states performance.	4.869961641515431
6755. the title refers to the nickname given his	wife by the composer who is also a member of the national film board	of canada.	4.023442417358424
6756. the work's two movements one melodically sentimental	the other brightly capricious are clever enough in a ravel-like	style but they rehash a wornout idiom.	4.206710149795431
6757. they might well indicate conjugal	felicity but in musical terms that smack of hollywood.	3.819066923884677
6758. works	by dohnanyi hubay mr d'albert himself and paganini	indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve	as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase.	4.7679538520464595
6759. standard items	by sarasate and saint-saens completed the program.	3.839926141012394
6760. in recent years anna xydis has played with the new york	philharmonic and at lewisohn stadium but her program last night	at town hall was the greek-born pianist's first new york recital	since 1948.	5.420258512534536
6761. miss xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard	and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the	authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control.	3.4784897331209184
6762. and the	tone she commands is always beautiful in sound.	6.018876913204683
6763. since she also	has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the	romantic tradition miss xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure.	3.6216381754014124
6764. she played with style and a touch of the grand manner and every	piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures.	5.231615829474255
6765. the second half of her program was devoted to russian composers	of this century.	4.121887653630306
6766. it was in them that miss xydis was at her best.	7.286908435691379
6767. the rachmaninoff prelude no 12 op 32 for instance gave	her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities- the	ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them	simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble.	2.921185220871843
6768. the	four kabalevsky preludes were also assured rich in color and songful.	5.724224599692095
6769. and the prokofieff seventh sonata had the combination of romanticism	and modern bravura that prokofieff needs.	4.001259153477553
6770. miss	xydis'	earlier selections were mendelssohn's variations serieuses in which	each variation was nicely set off from the others; haydn's sonata	in e minor which was unfailingly pleasant in sound and chopin's	sonata in b flat minor.	4.258817405404139
6771. a memory lapse in the last somewhat	marred the pianist's performance.	4.16119916318673
6772. so what was the deepest music	on her program had the poorest showing.	6.195226430699775
6773. miss xydis was best when	she did not need to be too probing.	5.088329908588709
6774. all the generals who held important commands in world war	2 did not write books.	6.470239501815124
6775. it only seems as if they did.	6.135939380261984
6776. and the	best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written.	5.790571860676611
6777. one	of the very best is only now published in this country five years	after its first publication in england.	4.172152341092497
6778. it is defeat into victory	by field marshal viscount slim.	6.032942550376746
6779. a long book heavily	weighted with military technicalities in this edition it is neither	so long nor so technical as it was originally.	3.4854058179585623
6780. field marshal slim	has abridged it for the benefit of those who finding not so great	an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves are more	interested in men and their reactions to stress hardship and danger.	5.020383258630392
6781. the man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is of	course the field marshal himself.	3.9810127368630432
6782. william joseph slim	first viscount slim former governor general of australia was the	principal british commander in the field during the burma war.	5.569932392925513
6783. he	had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat	of 1942 when the ill-prepared ill-equipped british forces were outmaneuvered	outfought and outgeneraled.	3.1481782883074882
6784. he returned in command of	an international army of gurkhas indians africans chinese and	british.	5.607488755266293
6785. and in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles	and hills and along the great rivers of burma he waged one of the most	brilliant campaigns of the war.	3.982619373846727
6786. the forgotten war his soldiers	called the burma fighting because the war in africa and europe	enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines.	5.050196274497023
6787. parts of defeat	into victory are a tangle of burmese place names and military	units but a little application makes everything clear enough.	3.267445412887005
6788. on	the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book.	7.495484945555711
6789. field marshal slim is striking in description amusing in many anecdotes.	3.9293783696508453
6790. he has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit	mistakes and even a cardinal error.	6.1761903548923875
6791. he praises many individuals	generously.	5.123384103136574
6792. he himself seems to be tough tireless able and intelligent	more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers.	5.911191734143956
6793. an army to win	defeat into victory is a dramatic	and lively military narrative.	3.7729969068761364
6794. but it is most interesting in its account	of the unending problems of high command of decisions and their	reasons of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle	action.	5.516840731485682
6795. before he could return to burma field marshal	slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite	them with fresh recruits.	3.5823018944535883
6796. his remarks about training discipline	morale leadership and command are enlightening.	5.718289845864292
6797. he believed in making	inspiring speeches and he made a great many.	4.5744280089456515
6798. he believed in being	seen near the front lines and he was there.	6.856088301388871
6799. for general morale reasons	and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers when food was	short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly.	3.3910942504532766
6800. other crucial matters required constant supervision:	labor and all noncombatant troops whose morale was vital too;	administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with	top brass- british american and chinese; health hygiene medical	aid and preventive medicine; hospitals and nurses	; food and military supplies; logistics and transport;	airdrops and airstrips; roads and river barges to be built.	4.128468980179795
6801. of a commander	commenting on these and other matters field	marshal slim makes many frank and provocative remarks:   when	in doubt as to two courses of action a general should choose the	bolder.	3.431222650689014
6802. the commander has failed in his duty if he	has not won victory- for that is his duty.	4.9530373332478375
6803. it only	does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which	others may have but which you cannot give them.	3.6965116328476877
6804. so	i made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some	of it.	5.483463920808223
6805. field marshal slim is more impressed by the courage	of japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders.	3.998868896569494
6806. of the japanese private he says: he fought and marched till	he died.	6.3144044912322945
6807. if 500 japanese were ordered to hold a position we had to	kill 495 before it was ours- and then the last five killed themselves.	3.842794894710814
6808. brooding about future wars the field marshal has this	to say: the asian fighting man is at least equally brave as	the white usually more careless of death less encumbered by mental	doubts less troubled by humanitarian sentiment and not so moved by	slaughter and mutilation around him.	4.464122156548164
6809. he is by background and living	standards better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly to demand	less in the way of subsistence or comfort and to look after himself	when thrown on his own resources.	3.5702553001774375
6810. a bunch of young buckaroos from out west who go by the name	of texas boys choir loped into town hall last night and succeeded	in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience.	4.6904356491246855
6811. actually the	program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded	and they sang it beautifully.	3.686599428352056
6812. under the capable direction of the choir's	founder geroge bragg the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds	in an opening group of renaissance and baroque madrigals and motets	excerpts from pergolesi's stabat mater and all of the	britten ceremonial of carols.	4.685290021022158
6813. their singing was well-balanced	clear and within obvious limitations extremely pleasing.	4.00791661363441
6814. the	limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices-	an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity an occasional	waver and now and then a bleat.	4.827867814848142
6815. but mr bragg is	a remarkably gifted conductor and the results he has produced with	his boys are generally superior.	3.7649660480009848
6816. most surprising of all he has accomplished	some prodigies in training for the production of words.	6.530409635395313
6817. the latin	for example was not only clear; it was even beautiful.	3.814063239116131
6818. furthermore there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation	of the music.	6.114808044874642
6819. lines came out neatly and in good balance.	4.340699778392519
6820. the piano accompaniments by istvan szelenyi were stylish.	5.212062429831616
6821. a boy soprano named dixon boyd sang a durante solo motet and	a few other passages enchantingly.	3.1854372213447664
6822. other capable soloists included	david clifton joseph schockler and pat thompson.	5.714967463857636
6823. the final	group included folk songs from back home stomped out shouted and	chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume.	3.0275015173568347
6824. boys will be	boys and texans will be texans.	6.4761350550005385
6825. the combination proved quite irresistible	last night.	3.8879962348465313
6826. the polish song and dance company called mazowsze after	the region of poland where it has its headquarters opened a three-week	engagement at the city center last night.	4.720296285980717
6827. a thoroughly ingratiating	company it is and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly	realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all	evening.	3.6787036419889865
6828. not that it is all funny by any means though some	of it is definitely so but simply that the dancers are young and handsome	high-spirited and communicative and the program itself is as vivacious	as it is varied.	5.663836762755267
6829. there is no use at all in trying to follow	it dance by dance and title by title for it has a kind of nonstop format	and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses	for identification.	3.656538533369034
6830. the material is all basically of folk origin	gleaned from every section of poland.	5.170514894301992
6831. but under the direction of	mira ziminska-sygietynska who with her late husband founded the	organization in 1948 it has all been put into theatrical form treated	selectively choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators	and performed altogether professionally.	3.246719020499519
6832. under the surface of the	wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training	and an equally professional sense of performing.	5.392110157734287
6833. since	the organization was created thirteen years ago it is obvious that	this is not the original company; it is more likely the sons and daughters	of that company.	3.9385118107517254
6834. the girls are charming children and the men	are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters.	5.1495731446615896
6835. the stage is constantly	full of them; indeed there are never fewer than eight of them on	stage and that is only for the more intimate numbers.	3.575855760056082
6836. they can be exuberant	or sentimental flirtatious or funny but the only thing they	seem unable to be is dull.	5.885988021995292
6837. to pick out particular numbers is	something of a problem but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously	excellent to be missed.	3.695802821747758
6838. there is for example a stunning krakowiak	that closes the first act; the mazurka choreographed by witold	zapala to music from moniuszko's opera strasny dwor'	may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see; there	is an enchanting polonaise; and the dances and songs from the tatras	contain a magnificent dance for the men.	4.860888571113923
6839. everywhere there are	little touches of humor and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians	is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments	with winning warmth.	3.430197575514666
6840. the matunuck presents king	of	hearts by jean kerr and eleanor brooke.	4.9134743406513435
6841. directed by michael	murray; settings by william david roberts.	4.179210848678788
6842. the cast:	producer john holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season's	opener at matunuck in jean kerr's king of hearts.	4.406714875228372
6843. the dialogue is sharp witty and candid- typical don't eat	the daisies material- which has stamped the author throughout her	books and plays and it was obvious that the theatre-by-the-sea audience	liked it.	3.074410600814286
6844. the story is of a famous strip cartoonist an	arty individual whose specialty is the american boy and who adopts	a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material.	4.741179043635852
6845. this is	when his troubles begin not to mention a fiedgling artist who he hires	and who turns out to have ideas of his own with particular respect	to the hero's sweetheart-secretary.	3.412233894592033
6846. john heffernan playing	larry larkin the cartoonist carries the show in marvelous fashion.	5.810057612033222
6847. his portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless.	3.9311046111931476
6848. this may be unfortunate perhaps from the standpoint	of david hedison providence's contribution to hollywood who is	appearing by special arrangement with 20th century-fox.	4.963670003404378
6849. not that	mr hedison does not make the most of his role.	5.414606572755717
6850. but the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist and it	has to be that way.	6.019776646177577
6851. a word should be said for gary morgan a	broadway youngsters who as the adopted son makes life miserable for	nearly everybody and larkin in particular.	3.3154474541532286
6852. and for his playmate francis	coletta of west warwick who has a bit part billy.	6.179681480399518
6853. on the whole audiences will like this performance.	5.2287720101218635
6854. it is a tremendous	book lively constantly moving and the matunuck cast does well	by it.	5.481757552630928
6855. the presents epitaph for	george dillon	by john osborne and anthony creighton directed by wallace	gray.	3.2010470245769134
6856. the cast:    the angriest young man in	newport last night was at the playhouse where epitaph for george	dillon opened as the jazz festival closed.	4.6762148998720745
6857. for the hero	of this work by john osborne and anthony creighton is a chap embittered	by more than the lack of beer during a jam session.	3.7827189493252003
6858. he's mad	at a world he did not make.	7.2674174820807504
6859. furthermore he's something of	a scoundrel an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips.	3.740896432862331
6860. this is in contrast to the family with whom he boards.	9.062660012462327
6861. they not only	think and feel cliches but live cliches as well.	3.799606862592114
6862. it is into this	household one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls	out of its people that george dillon enters at the beginning of the	play.	5.167258534336158
6863. an unsuccessful playwright and actor he has faith only	in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists.	4.345513088918345
6864. by the end of the	third act the artist is dead but the body lingers on a shell among other	shells.	6.266667963243692
6865. not altogether a successful play epitaph for	george dillon overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in	a lesser work might be crippling.	3.4303364623800348
6866. it is awfully talky for instance	and not all of the talk is terribly impressive.	6.315221786259129
6867. but it strikes sparks	on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten.	4.2940685733593
6868. there is a fine second act as an example one in which samuel groom	as dillon has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage	after another.	6.204373734126072
6869. this is an exciting young actor to watch.	4.952082657253255
6870. just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is laura stuart	whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch.	5.532963154941271
6871. miss stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish almost an	icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment.	3.5524879313112687
6872. also fine are	sue lawless as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female	spider and just as destructive harold cherry as her scratchy	spouse and hildy weissman as a vegetable in human form.	4.643803371929234
6873. wallace	gray has directed a difficult play here usually well but with	just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste.	3.6036790406738657
6874. still his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection	of that pale sustenance despair.	5.649957152262803
6875. the presents where's	charley?	4.714224030340366
6876.  with music and lyrics by frank loesser directed	by christopher hewett choreography by peter conlow musical direction	by samuel matlowsky.	5.324928373593282
6877. the cast:    everybody fell	in love with amy again last night at the warwick musical theater	and shelley berman was to blame.	3.2358782908879795
6878. one of the finest soft shoe	tunes ever invented once in love with amy is also of course	one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come	out of american musical comedy in our era.	5.107658203136304
6879. so the audience last	night was all ears and eyes just after act 2 got a rousing opening	chorus where's charley?	3.5957531294840552
6880.  and berman sifted out all alone	on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering	into being.	5.107463587698603
6881. it is greatly to berman's credit that he	made no attempt to outdo ray bolger.	3.740590215443487
6882. he dropped his earlier and delightful	hamming which is about the only way to handle the old war horse	called charley's aunt and let himself go with as an appealing	an amy as anybody could ask.	5.309428596186003
6883. in brief berman played	himself and not bolger.	4.435983861800374
6884. the big audience started applauding even	before he had finished.	5.532630316159545
6885. the whole production this week is fresh	and lively.	3.962208872477943
6886. the costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous	gowns and picture hats of the gibson girl days.	4.775949176191838
6887. the ballet work	is on the nose especially in the opening number by the new ashmolean	marching society and students' conservatory band along	with a fiery and sultry brazilian fantasia later.	3.233871746015015
6888. berman whose	fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist	proved himself very much at home in musical comedy.	5.62705827402971
6889. sparrow-size	virginia gibson with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful	smile made a suitably perky amy while melisande congdon as the real	aunt was positively	monumental in the very best gibson girl manner.	3.2222172420553377
6890. all told where's charley?	9.041826242929378
6891.  ought not to be missed.	6.719050544840692
6892. it has a fast pace excellent music expert direction and not only	a good comedian but an appealing person in his own right mr	berman.	5.767906587139055
6893. the broadway theater league of rhode island presents c	edwin knill's and martin tahse's production of	at veterans memorial auditorium.	2.9824453946759766
6894. the book is by jerome	weidman and george abbott music by jerry bock lyrics by sheldon	harnick choreography by peter gennaro scenery costumes and	lighting by william and jean eckart musical direction by jack elliott	and the production was directed by mr abbott.	4.258006466515188
6895. the cast:	this is one of the happier events of the season.	4.23609012072905
6896. the company which performed the pulitzer prize musical here last night	and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce the politicians	are in fine voice the chorines evoke happy memories and the little	flower rides to break a lance again.	4.371105868535677
6897. i saw fiorello!	performed in new york by the original cast and i think this company	is every bit as good and perhaps better.	4.1767615319203895
6898. certainly in the matter	of principals there is nothing lacking.	7.61529367411014
6899. bob carroll may not bear	quite as close a physical resemblance to laguardia as tom bosley	does but i was amazed at the way he became more and more fiorello	as the evening progressed until one had to catch one's self up and	remember that this wasn't really laguardia come back among us again.	3.19136601660661
6900. then rudy bond was simply grand as ben the distraught	republican party district chieftain.	5.462274297171801
6901. and paul lipson as morris	the faithful one who never gets home to his shirley's dinner was	fine too.	3.42740774234939
6902. as for the ladies they were full of charm and sincerity	and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving honest	little man.	5.5449720863678
6903. charlotte fairchild was excellent as the loyal marie	who became the second mrs laguardia singing and acting with	remarkable conviction.	3.266882509943423
6904. jen nelson as thea his first wife managed	to make that short role impressive.	5.147626124721453
6905. and little zeme north a dora	with real spirit and verve was fascinating whether she was singing of	her love for floyd the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then	is promoted into garbage or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings.	2.9217280718644902
6906. such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual	treatment of on the side of the angels and politics and poker	were handled splendidly and i thought rudy bond and his band	of tuneful ward-heelers made little tin box even better than	it was done by the new york cast; all the words of its clever	lyrics came through with perfect clarity.	5.063081812118299
6907. the party at floyd's	penthouse gave the chorines a chance for a nostalgic frolic	through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic	statement of the era's nonsense.	3.2175683083809847
6908. laguardia's multi-lingual	rallies when he is running for congress are well staged	and wind up in a wild jewish folk-dance that is really great musical	theater.	5.407186178432609
6909. martin tahse has established quite a reputation for	himself as a successful stager of touring productions.	3.633193908344151
6910. not a corner	has been visibly cut in this one.	7.03246522614121
6911. the sets are remarkably elaborate	for a road-show that doesn't pause long in any one place and they	are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness.	3.2896979134636193
6912. being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience	with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their	eyes.	5.635883148408253
6913. i'm glad to say there's none of that distraction in this	it has all been done in superb style	and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts	who enjoys good musical theater.	3.461847772710159
6914. presents	an mgm picture produced by joe pasternak and directed	by henry levin from a screenplay by george wells.	4.72366754102641
6915. the cast:	since the hero a sterling and upright fellow is a rich brown	senior while two yalies are cast as virtual rapists i suppose	i should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on where the	boys are but i shall do nothing of the sort.	2.796606345637249
6916. instead-	and not just to prove my objectivity- i hasten to report that it's	a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of	reporting on the easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in fort	lauderdale and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with	the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group-	that is to say sex.	4.865336230719065
6917. the answers the girls give struck	me as reasonably varied and healthily individual.	3.376082427626493
6918. if most of them weren't	exactly specific- well that's the way it is in life i guess.	7.236158782110876
6919. but at least it's reassuring to see some teenagers who don't	profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems	instead.	3.8078454483430857
6920. where the boys are also has a juvenile bounce	that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy.	6.2590317236852995
6921. there are some sharp	and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations- the best	of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where	a mermaid is performing.	3.2132013692812205
6922. most of the female faces are	new or at least not too familiar.	7.751230832752206
6923. dolores hart is charming in a leading	role and quite believable.	3.760069598885653
6924. i was delighted with paula prentiss'	comedy performance which was as fresh and unstilted as one's	highest hopes might ask.	5.321816294006204
6925. a couple of the males made good comedy too-	jim hutton and frank gorshin.	3.8737276248294004
6926. the only performance which	was too soft for me was that of yvette mimieux but since someone	had to become the victim of despoilers just to emphasize that such things	do happen at these fracases i suppose this was the attitude the	part called for.	5.036157218408812
6927. i must say however that i preferred the acting that	had something of a biting edge to it.	4.00323035223201
6928. to anyone who remembers	newport at its less than maximum violence this view of what the	boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the jazz	festival ought to prove entertaining.	5.1986785100986515
6929. the second feature	is a british detective story that	will talk your head off.	3.5723543856090187
6930. the superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of william james	was never more evident than in his letters.	4.964814055383204
6931. here was a man with an	enormous gift for living as well as thinking.	5.675714773408054
6932. to both persons and ideas	he brought the same delighted interest the same open-minded relish	for what was unique in each the same discriminating sensibility and	quicksilver intelligence the same gallantry of judgment.	4.818357965458134
6933. for	this latest addition to the great letters series under the general	editorship of louis kronenberger miss hardwick has made a selection	which admirably displays the variety of james's genius not	to mention the felicities of his style.	3.291056487448962
6934. and how he could write!	his famous criticism of brother henry's third style is surely	as subtly even elegantly worded an analysis of the latter's intricate	air castles as henry himself could ever have produced.	4.588200884753166
6935. his letter	to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant	forthright and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up	penned to a sensitive child and with just the right tone of unpatronizing	good humor.	3.3493773636607065
6936. most of all his letters to his philosophic	colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help	to explain whitehead's reference to james as that adorable genius.	5.698618937065175
6937. miss hardwick speaks of his superb gift for intellectual	friendship and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life	lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism.	3.761030452107661
6938. this is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where	there seems to be an increasing lack of communication- or even desire	for communication- between differing schools of thought.	5.662837712060685
6939. it holds	an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word intellectual	has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people	who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human	virtues.	3.464148954580343
6940. to his harvard colleague josiah royce whose philosophic	position differed radically from his own james could write	different as our minds are yours has nourished mine as no other	social influence ever has and in converse with you i have always felt	that my life was being lived importantly.	4.502792311044052
6941. of another colleague	george santayana he could write: the great event in	my life recently has been the reading of santayana's book.	3.9119699776160037
6942. although	i absolutely reject the platonism of it i have literally squealed	with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position	is laid down on page after page.	4.936567673097116
6943. writing to his colleague	george herbert palmer- glorious old palmer as he addresses	him- james says that if only the students at harvard could really	understand royce santayana palmer and himself and see that	their varying systems are so many religions ways of fronting life	and worth fighting for then harvard would have a genuine philosophic	universe.	3.1836408647601036
6944. the best condition of it would be an open conflict	and rivalry of the diverse systems h.	5.977825881548128
6945. the world might ring with the	struggle if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other.	3.3949327613105384
6946. the belaboring is of course jocular yet james was	not lacking in fundamental seriousness- unless we measure him by	that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who	stakes all on his vision of god.	4.573961744719453
6947. to james this vision never quite	came despite his appreciation of it in others.	4.08255224873627
6948. but there is a	dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one	correspondent:	you ask what i am going to 'reply' to bradley.	5.58926904069104
6949. but why need one reply to everything and everybody?	4.595526428476649
6950.  h i think	that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations.	6.181656752674686
6951. all polemic of ours should i believe be either very broad statements	of contrast or fine points treated singly and as far as possible	impersonally h.	3.4347019806843897
6952. as far as the rising generation goes why not simply	express ourselves positively and trust that the truer view quietly	will displace the other.	5.328311253097515
6953. here again 'god will know his own'.	5.098274390259535
6954. the collected works of james thurber now numbering 25 volumes	represent a high standard of literary	excellence as every schoolboy knows.	4.643733122605709
6955. the primitive-eclogue quality	of his drawings akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall	is equally well known.	3.1688654878689824
6956. about all that remains to be said is that the	present selection most of which appeared first in the new yorker	comprises a slightly unstrung necklace held together by little	more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the	book.	5.740175200371267
6957. the one unifying note if any is sounded in the initial	article entitled: how to get through the day.	3.3925432915327804
6958. it is repeated	at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs	the hospitalized and others forced to rely on inner resources	including palindromes paraphrases	and parodies.	4.657387276518066
6959. the tyranny of trivia suggests	arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber.	3.32966505782252
6960. and new vistas	of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled:	friends romans countrymen lend me your ear-muffs	such a phrase as drifts through dream and the new vocabularianism.	4.595300625502792
6961. some of thurber's curative methods involve strong	potions of mixed metaphor malapropism and gobbledygook and are recommended	for use only in extreme cases.	3.4168824367739368
6962. a burlesque paean	entitled: hark the herald tribune times and all the other	angels sing brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture	ballyhooey.	4.823675436759078
6963. how the kooks crumble features an amusingly	accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-tv	commercials and the watchers of the night is a veritable	waking nightmare.	3.2418061942202003
6964. a semi-serious literary document entitled	the wings of henry james is noteworthy if only for a keenly	trenchant though little-known comment on the master's difficult	later period by modest owen wister author of the virginian.	4.590546739509155
6965. james he remarks in a letter to a friend is attempting the impossible	h namely to produce upon the reader as a painting produces	upon the gazer a number of superimposed simultaneous impressions.	3.6178069424291004
6966. he	would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you	could read them all at once and get all at once the various shadings	and complexities.	5.913612262934474
6967. equally penetrating in its fashion is	the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation:	so much has already been written about everything that you can't	find out anything about it.	3.439143267604246
6968. or the mildly epigrammatic utterance	: woman's place is in the wrong.	7.051046058822499
6969. who	but thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences?	3.6391063585883545
6970. 	a tribute to midsummer bang-sashes seems terribly funny	though it would be hard to explain why.	5.704272330832894
6971. one of them banged the sash	of the window nearest my bed around midnight in july and i leaped	out of sleep and out of bed.	3.8052734849394176
6972. 'it's just a bat' said my wife reassuringly	and i sighed with relief.	5.261428413355632
6973. 'thank god for that' i said;	'i thought it was a human being'.	4.3751919626971505
6974. in a sense	perhaps thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter	who first conceived the startling fancy of	a picture window in the abdomen.	4.853990965386249
6975. that is it is literally a picture	window: you don't see into the viscera; you see a picture- trees	or flowers.	3.7639554947621883
6976. this is something like what thurber's best effects	are like if i am not mistaken.	6.296634954355297
6977. though no longer able to turn	out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches	thurber has retained unimpaired	his vision of humor as a thing of simple unaffected humanness.	3.416306983925109
6978. in	his concluding paragraph he writes: the devoted writer of humor	will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can.	5.347835833442276
6979. for many	readers thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight.	4.093465090615766
6980. the latest low is a puzzler.	6.22971576743335
6981. the master's hand has lost none	of its craft.	3.4216983403324184
6982. he is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions	of political and diplomatic life in the fifties.	6.0094272345779105
6983. the reader	meets a few old friends like blimp and the tuc horse and	becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like	the bomb itself and civilization in her classic robe watching the	nuclear arms race her hair standing straight out.	3.0381466248628373
6984. but there	is a difference between the present volume and the early low.	7.258549009804316
6985. there	is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings	show.	4.286335611862382
6986. but there was terror in the thirties when the nazis were	on the loose and in those days low struck like lightning.	5.949284999519992
6987. anyone	can draw his own conclusions from this difference.	4.157028464986667
6988. it might be	argued that the communists are less inhuman than the nazis and furnish	the artist with drama in a lower key.	5.466728936610233
6989. but this argument cannot be	pushed very far because the communist system makes up for any shortcomings	of its leaders in respect to corrosion.	3.6316904575174407
6990. the communists wield	a power unknown to hitler.	5.474856342144207
6991. and the leading issue that of piecemeal	aggression remains the same.	4.504690562395809
6992. do we ourselves	offer mr low less of a crusade?	7.308184387227452
6993.  in the thirties we would	not face our enemy; that was a nightmarish situation and low was	in his element.	3.5837373918284885
6994. now we have stood up to the communists; we are stronger	and more self-confident- and low cannot so easily put us to rights.	5.8070829973644305
6995. or does the reason for less jovian drawings lie elsewhere?	4.764553723546658
6996. 	it might be that low has seen too many stupidities and that they	do not outrage him now.	4.953537009901025
6997. he writes confucius held that in times	of stress one should take short views- only up to lunchtime.	3.511602594954084
6998. whatever the cause his mood in the fifties rarely rises above	the level of the capably sardonic.	6.056833124524212
6999. dulles?	7.781497302878112
7000.  he does not seem to have	caught the subtleties of the man.	7.626914341485807
7001. mccarthy?	7.781497302878112
7002.  the skies turn dark	but the clouds do not loose their wrath.	4.901094182218464
7003. suez?	7.781497302878112
7004.  low seems to have	supported eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently	so there is no fire in his eye.	5.459374878472901
7005. stalin's death	churchill's farewell to public life hillary and tensing on everest	quemoy and matsu- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade.	3.1052224235130756
7006. instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles.	7.98651485183694
7007. did low decide to let well enough alone when	he made his selections?	4.03513358936939
7008.    he often drew the bomb.	7.716912527852938
7009. he showed puny	men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines.	4.0618815586079
7010. and khrushchev turned	out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all.	5.85301354876531
7011. look in this book for weak mortals and only	on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale.	3.763011646818528
7012. read the moderately	brief text not for captions sometimes for tart epigrams once	in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas.	5.391180200707478
7013. a gray fox with a patch on one eye- confidence man city slicker	lebensraum specialist- tries to take over catfish bend in this	third relaxed allegory from mr burman's refreshing louisiana	animal community.	2.986372800174044
7014. the fox is all ingratiating smiles when he	arrives from new orleans accompanied by one wharf rat.	4.764143175048807
7015. but like all	despots as he builds his following from among the gullible he grows	more threatening toward those who won't follow- such solid citizens	as doc raccoon; judge black the vegetarian black snake;	and the eagle who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in	washington posing for fifty-cent pieces.	3.0155733548678345
7016. as soon as the fox	has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats who	of course say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination	campaign	in the city.	5.4884253298447065
7017. about the very things	they train the mink	and other animals to fight.	4.133160551845829
7018. and pretty soon gray fox is announcing that	he won't have anyone around that's against him and setting out	to break his second territorial treaty with the birds.	4.741438061946248
7019. robert	hillyer the poet writes in his introduction to this brief animal	fable that mr burman ought to win a nobel prize for the catfish	bend series.	3.5548593644834297
7020. he may have a point in urging that decadent themes be	given fewer prizes.	6.556903021018297
7021. but it's hard to imagine mr burman as a nobel	laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous	fables.	3.845382345194042
7022. in substance they lie somewhere between the southern	dialect animal stories of joel chandler harris and	the polished witty fables of james thurber.	4.661998346642593
7023. george kennan's account of relations between russia and the	west from the fall of tsarism to the end of world war 2 is the	finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years.	3.9914850765321632
7024. it combines qualities that are seldom found in one work: scrupulous	scholarship a fund of personal experience a sense of drama and characterization	and a broad grasp of the era's great historical issues.	5.234861146561591
7025. in short the book based largely on lectures delivered at harvard	university is both reliable and readable; the author possesses	an uncommonly fine english style and he is dealing with subjects	of vast importance that are highly topical for our time.	3.1914402426395676
7026. if mr	kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals if his analysis	of how western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars	and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic- well the	record itself is not too encouraging.	4.7342225318094
7027. mr kennan takes careful	account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical	atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken.	3.4326405286258317
7028. but he rejects	perhaps a little too sweepingly the theory that disloyal and pro-communist	influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing stalin	which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high	point at the yalta conference in february 1945.	5.615947491847271
7029. after all	alger hiss subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he	gave secret state department documents to soviet agents was at yalta.	3.3454096839557588
7030. and harry dexter white implicated in fbi reports	in communist associations was one of the architects of the morgenthau	plan which had it ever been put into full operation would have	simply handed germany to stalin.	5.136451945117543
7031. one item in this unhappy scheme was	to have germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors	among whom only the soviet union possessed real military strength.	3.4444931615751133
7032. it is quite probable however that stupidity inexperience and	childish adherence to slogans like unconditional surrender had	more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than	treason or sympathy with communism.	5.328397235022805
7033. mr kennan sums up his judgment	of what went wrong this way:	you see	first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills the unshakeable	american commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender:	the tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as	a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given	status quo but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and	total evil with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought	to the complete destruction of the enemy's power no matter what disadvantages	or complications this might involve for the more distant	future.	3.4064064028833045
7034. recognizing that there could have been no effective	negotiated peace with hitler he points out the shocking failure to	give support to the anti-nazi underground which very nearly eliminated	hitler in 1944.	5.066684043160224
7035. a veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge	of russian language history and literature kennan recalls how at	the time of hitler's attack on the soviet union in 1941 he penned	a private note to a state department official expressing the hope	that never would we associate ourselves with russian purposes in	the areas of eastern europe beyond her own boundaries.	3.0753238802826455
7036. with justified bitterness the author speaks of what	seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the	nature of the russian communist movement about the history of its	diplomacy about what had happened in the purges and about what had	been going on in poland and the baltic states.	5.3424727151387525
7037. he also speaks of	franklin d roosevelt's puerile assumption that if only	he could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone	like fdr himself ideological preconceptions would melt and	russia's co-operation with the west could be easily arranged.	3.1318551370839627
7038. no wonder khrushchev's first message to president kennedy	was a wistful desire for the return of the good old days of roosevelt.	5.68415919428076
7039. this fascinating story begins with a sketch rich in	personal detail of the glancing mutual impact of world war 1 and	the two instalments of the russian revolution.	3.5879514398571093
7040. the first of these	involved the replacement of the tsar by a liberal provisional government	in march 1917; the second the seizure of power by the bolsheviks	in november of the	same year.	4.957779676798838
7041. as kennan shows the judgment of the allied governments	about what was happening in russia was warped by the obsession	of defeating germany.	3.5693915469440394
7042. they were blind to the evidence that nothing	could keep the russian people fighting.	6.21336729332785
7043. they attributed everything	that went wrong in russia to german influence and intrigue.	3.8649397407673356
7044. this	more than any other factor led to the fiasco of allied intervention.	6.46891639048038
7045. as the author very justly says:   had a world war not been	in progress there would never under any conceivable stretch of the	imagination have been an allied intervention in north russia.	3.5366196526165123
7046. the scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated	by communist propaganda; here kennan operating with precise	facts and figures performs an excellent job of debunking.	4.418152112979796
7047. dictators	of many passages in the book that exemplify the author's	vivid style the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators	whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may	be selected.	3.311589374760089
7048. on stalin:   this was a man of incredible criminality	of a criminality effectively without limits; a man apparently	foreign to the very experience of love without mercy or pity;	a man in whose entourage none was ever safe; a man whose hand was set	against all that could not be useful to him at the moment; a man who	was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators	in crime h.	4.939609785128383
7049. and here is kennan's image of hitler	stalin's	temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of	weaker peoples and his later enemy:   behind that charlie	chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered	his forehead behind the tirades and the sulky silences the passionate	orations and the occasional dull evasive stare behind the prejudices	the cynicism the total amorality of behavior behind even the tendency	to great strategic mistakes there lay a statesman of no mean qualities:	shrewd calculating in many ways realistic endowed- like	stalin- with considerable powers of dissimulation capable of playing	his cards very close to his chest when he so desired yet bold and	resolute in his decisions and possessing one gift stalin did not	possess: the ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion	and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word.	2.79644042956073
7050. two criticisms	of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment	of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges- there is	no mention of the potsdam conference or the morgenthau plan.	4.655345244408275
7051. and	in a concluding chapter about america's stance in the contemporary	world one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come	to grips with the baffling riddle of our time: how to deal with	a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war.	2.951770678645842
7052. but one should not ask for everything.	7.878646780504552
7053. mr kennan who has recently	abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently	appointed american ambassador to yugoslavia is not the only man who	finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future.	3.6642585135764856
7054. the story of a quarter of a century of soviet-western relations	is vitally important and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical	narrator.	5.812291349362965
7055. the ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter	political	or domestic unrest lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit	and charm.	3.112315946365477
7056. in donnybrook there is quite a different eire a	rural land where singing dancing fist-fighting and romancing are the	thing.	5.100524975349751
7057. there is plenty of violence to be sure but it is a nice violence	and no one gets killed.	5.262336116268644
7058. by and large robert mcenroe's adaptation	of maurice walsh's film the quiet man provides	the entertainment it set out to and we have a lively musical show if	not a superlative one.	5.267696695467327
7059. this is the tale of one john enright	an american who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring	and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become	a quiet man.	3.656281900930499
7060. but innesfree where ellen roe danaher and her	bullying brother will live is no place for a man who will not use	his fists.	5.733084439160128
7061. so enright's courting of the mettlesome ellen is impeded	considerably thereby providing the tale which is told.	3.5361930869908837
7062. you may be	sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with	the brother and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way	to ensure that you understand what the word donnybrook means.	5.688964194546361
7063. then there is a matchmaker one mikeen flynn a role for which eddie	foy was happily selected.	4.285854836155397
7064. now there is no reason in the world why	a matchmaker in ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe	dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs torso and neck	except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play.	5.701514621027669
7065. mr foy is a joy having learned his dancing by practicing it	until he is practically perfect.	3.5523773216272025
7066. his matchmaking is naturally incidental	and it only serves flynn right when a determined widow takes	him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony.	4.9196544198794685
7067. art lund a fine	big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice impersonates	enright.	3.696655045784853
7068. although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic	technique that's not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have	anyway.	6.19098749167541
7069. joan fagan a fiery redhead who can impress you that she	has a temper whether she really has one or not plays ellen and sings	the role very well too.	3.1327212489748097
7070. if the mettle which ellen exhibits has	a bit of theatrical dross in it never mind; she fits into the general	scheme well enough.	4.936933778875784
7071. susan johnson as the widow spends the	first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented	death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new	one.	3.859197992530216
7072. she has a good firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues	of the evening.	5.934182038121577
7073. then there are a pair of old biddies played	by grace carney and sibly bowan who may be right off the shelf	of stock irish characters but they put such a combination of good	will and malevolence into their parts that they're quite entertaining.	3.436511263662191
7074. and in the role of will danaher philip bosco roars and sneers	sufficiently to intimidate not only one american but the whole british	army if he chose.	5.649526796353289
7075. donnybrook is no brigadoon	but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some	excellent dancing.	3.4342207532437596
7076. the ballads are sweet and sad and the music generally	competent.	5.528925130309185
7077. it sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after	the final curtain and some of it such as the catchy sez i	does.	4.095115315640612
7078. a toast to the bride sung by clarence nordstrom playing	a character called old man toomey is quite simple direct and	touching.	4.745599971254153
7079. the men of innesfree are got up authentically in	cloth caps and sweaters and their dancing and singing is fine.	3.3085172919335712
7080. so is	that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep	under jack cole's expert choreographic direction.	4.865937191193648
7081. the male dancers	sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and	stimulating.	3.4048803978325046
7082. rouben ter-arutunian in his stage settings	often uses the scrim curtain behind which mr cole has placed couples	or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow.	4.789281612666281
7083. there is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty	good time at donnybrook unless they are permanently in the	mood of enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable	irish.	3.569120671067228
7084. we can all breathe more easily this morning- more easily	and joyously too- because joshua logan has turned the stage show	fanny into a delightful and heart-warming film.	4.810292570320558
7085. the	task of taking the raw material of marcel pagnol's original trio	of french films about people of the waterfront in marseilles and putting	them again on the screen after their passage through the broadway	musical idiom was a delicate and perilous one indeed.	3.1264397681578093
7086. more than	the fans of pagnol's old films and of their heroic star the great	raimu were looking askance at the project.	5.176616015802364
7087. the fans of the musical	were too.	3.8076184611796076
7088. but now the task is completed and the uncertainty	resolved with the opening of the english-dialogue picture at the music	hall yesterday.	5.83638631172797
7089. whether fan of the pagnol films or stage show whether	partial to music or no you can't help but derive joy from this	picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart.	3.630408183885469
7090. some of the new york philharmonic musicians who live in	the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow.	6.404848912271371
7091. a tiny handful never did make the concert.	4.182597084871278
7092. but after a fifteen-minute	delay the substantially complete philharmonic assembled on stage	for the afternoon's proceedings.	5.499690899393948
7093. they faced a rather small audience	as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures	of the afternoon.	3.5810363907962675
7094. it was an excellent concert.	8.986500838907013
7095. paul	paray rounding out his current stint with the orchestra is a solid	musician and the philharmonic plays for him.	3.451963108949705
7096. their collaboration in	the beethoven second symphony was lucid intelligent and natural sounding.	5.543022641672086
7097. it was not a heavy ponderous beethoven.	5.714927090072753
7098. the music sang nicely	sprinted evenly when necessary was properly accented and balanced.	5.092465757283473
7099. the franck symphonic poem psyche is a	lush	sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again.	3.0518483810151933
7100. fortunate	for the music itself it is not too frequent a visitor; if	it were its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying.	5.434392519040261
7101. mr paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic	elements of the score.	3.887979231130546
7102. he did not let the strings for instance	weep whine or get hysterical.	6.498012745209644
7103. his interpretation was a model of refinement	and accuracy.	4.698351616704563
7104. and in the prokofieff c major piano	concerto with zadel skolovsky as soloist he was an admirable partner.	5.993986656416997
7105. mr skolovsky's approach to the concerto was bold sweeping	and tonally percussive.	4.183985810731201
7106. he swept through the music with ease in a	non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner.	5.718729692057169
7107. an impressive technician	mr skolovsky has fine rhythm to boot.	4.074654600222881
7108. his tone is the	weakest part of his equipment; it tends to be hard and colorless.	6.196134936709137
7109. a school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this	concerto needs.	3.6725754789688048
7110. it is after all a non-romantic work	; and the composer himself	was called the age of steel pianist.	5.882143381872128
7111. but granted all this one	still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than	mr skolovsky supplied.	3.6826033469950614
7112. taken as a whole though it was	a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra.	6.106471676291857
7113. mr skolovsky	fully deserved the warm reception he received.	4.242474666735501
7114. a new work on	the program was nikolai lopatnikoff's festival overture	receiving its first new york hearing.	5.6067256521441795
7115. this was composed last year as	a salute to the automobile industry.	4.339391494548015
7116. it is not program music though.	8.208928352300207
7117. it runs a little more than ten minutes is workmanlike busy methodical	and featureless.	4.510079896296752
7118. la gioconda like it or not is a singer's opera.	6.630974772681952
7119. and	so of course it is a fan's opera as well.	4.896353174553643
7120. snow or no the fans	were present in force at the metropolitan opera last night for a performance	of the ponchielli work.	5.468257187069862
7121. so the plot creaks the sets	are decaying the costumes are pre-historic the orchestra was sloppy	and not very well connected with what the singers were doing.	3.461703627959306
7122. after	all the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed	with no less than six leading parts.	5.350724902149763
7123. one of those parts	is that of evil evil barnaba the spy.	4.573583918244885
7124. his wicked deeds were carried	on by anselmo colzani who was taking the part for the first time	with the company.	5.584845845371105
7125. he has the temperament and the stage presence	for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone.	3.738466533089675
7126. what was lacking was a real sense of phrase the kind of legato singing	that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is after	all a very oily character.	5.722861710638932
7127. regina resnik as laura and cesare	siepi as alvise also were new to the cast but only with respect	to this season; they have both sung these parts here before.	3.165680613699075
7128. laura	is a good role for miss resnik and she gave it force dramatic color	and passion.	5.261152732865175
7129. mr siepi was as always a consummate actor;	with a few telling strokes he characterized alvise magnificently.	3.5765223392595953
7130. part of this characterization was of course accomplished with the	vocal chords.	6.945060334389705
7131. his singing was strong and musical; unfortunately his	voice was out of focus and often spread in quality.	3.6473875699947147
7132. eileen farrell	in the title role mignon dunn as la cieca and richard tucker	as enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season and	all contributed to a vigorous performance.	4.458909571274833
7133. if only they and fausto	cleva in the pit had got together a bit more.	4.031732074565048
7134. melodious birds sing madrigals saith the poet and no	better description of the madrigaling of the deller consort could	be imagined.	4.987965656773653
7135. their vanguard album	is a good sample of the special	elegant art of english madrigal singing.	3.7859123350374655
7136. it also makes a fine introduction	to the international art form with good examples of italian	and english madrigals plus several french chansons.	5.380272016039658
7137. the english have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better	than anyone else.	3.408299329343893
7138. the original impulses came to england late	and continue strong long after everyone else had	gone on to the baroque basso continuo sonatas operas and the like.	4.752029868184393
7139. even after elizabethan traditions were weakened by the cromwellian	interregnum the practice of singing together- choruses catches	and glees- always flourished.	3.547762305878731
7140. the english never again developed	a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier	great age the way say the opera in italy blotted out the italian	madrigal.	4.7537029529347725
7141. latter-day interest in elizabethan singing	dates well back into the nineteenth century in england much ahead	of similar revivals in other countries.	3.6773138954496583
7142. as a result no comparable	literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more	often performed than the english madrigal.	5.948766114658292
7143. naturally mr	deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant	when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their	countrymen: william byrd thomas morley and thomas tomkins.	3.2873469245074474
7144. there is an almost instrumental quality to their singing with a tendency	to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture.	5.808131328759905
7145. both techniques give the music purity and clarity.	4.655127358638009
7146. claude	jannequin's vocal description of a battle	is	lots of fun and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other	chansons by jannequin and lassus.	5.356083798294173
7147. only with the more sensual intense	and baroque expressions of marenzio monteverdi and gesualdo	does the singing seem a little superficial.	3.56443382337136
7148. nevertheless the	musicality accuracy and infectious charm of these performances excellently	reproduced make it an attractive look-see at the period.	5.436016864822483
7149. the	works are presented chronologically.	4.936647285598212
7150. texts and translations are provided.	6.661605776074197
7151. the elements of elegance and color in jannequin	are strong french characteristics.	3.8415630698088563
7152. baroque instrumental music	in italy and germany tends to be strong lively intense controlled	and quite abstract.	5.2754730906182825
7153. in france it remained always more picturesque	more dancelike more full of flavor.	3.9117836688201573
7154. couperin and rameau	gave titles to nearly everything they wrote not in the later sense	of program music but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close	clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance.	5.000400475635259
7155. both composers turn up on new imports from france.	4.516910241345334
7156. bam	is the unlikely name of a french recording company whose full label is	editions de la boite a musique.	5.051634019666791
7157. they specialize in out-of-the-way	items and old french music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention.	3.9281384639150385
7158. of couperin le grand occupy	two disks and reveal the impeccable taste	and workmanship of this master- delicate flexible and gemlike.	5.148040285319597
7159. the concerts- nos 2 6 9 10 and 14 are represented-	are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the italian	sense.	3.01859540750716
7160. the sonatas la francaise la sultane l'astree	and l'imperiale are often more elaborately worked	out and in fact show a strong italian influence.	4.52396863647594
7161. couperin	also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk	called	.	3.9081561501997273
7162. jean-marie leclair still is remembered a bit but bodin de	beismortier corrette and mondonville are hardly household words.	4.759222790795286
7163. what is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal	the aspect of french music that was moving toward the rococo.	3.7579727273105368
7164. the couperin la steinkerque with its battle music brevity	wit and refined simplicity already shakes off corelli and points	towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era.	4.176707889716354
7165. if	couperin shows the fashionable trend the others do so all the more.	3.816574115694209
7166. all these records have close attractive sound and the performances	by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic.	5.976413260207349
7167. rameau's	recorded by l'orchestre de	chambre pierre menet turn out to be harpsichord	pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself.	3.622793711773643
7168. the strange delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes	inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious.	4.611329576718969
7169. maitres	allemands des 17e et 18e siecles contains music	by pachelbel buxtehude rosenmueller and telemann well performed	by the ensemble instrumental sylvie spycket	.	2.882138935441251
7170. rococo music- a lot of it- was played in carnegie recital	hall on saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored	this season by a new organization known as globe concert arts.	5.690593560617604
7171. works by j c bach anton craft joseph haydn giuseppe	sammartini comenico dragonetti and j g janitsch were	performed by seven instrumentalists including anabel brieff flutist	josef marx oboist and robert conant pianist and harpsichordist.	2.7436628006725217
7172. since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all	it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown	accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from beethoven	to boulez.	4.801620686518088
7173. thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century	charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on saturday	night.	4.30102004688391
7174. each might find a useful place in a varied musical program	but taken together they grew quite tiresome.	5.4625993138462094
7175. the performances	were variable those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying	some by soloists proving rather trying.	3.2969525532830635
7176. ellie mao soprano and frederick fuller baritone presented	a program of folksongs entitled east meets west in carnegie	recital hall last night.	4.614613625490912
7177. they were accompanied by anna mi lee	pianist.	5.032578996483329
7178. selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos	and duets in a broad range of languages.	5.2809182631121185
7179. songs from china and japan	were reserved exclusively for miss mao who is a native of china	and those of the british isles were sung by mr fuller who is	english by birth.	3.6357108228623645
7180. this was not a program intended to illustrate	authentic folk styles.	8.121047720093799
7181. on the contrary miss mao and mr fuller	chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such	as mendelssohn dvorak canteloube copland and britten.	3.6430104289046152
7182. thre	was	therefore more musical substance in the concert than might have been	the case otherwise.	5.33605186501547
7183. the performances were assured communicative and	pleasingly informal.	3.630412119510906
7184. what was omitted from a neglected education were	those essentials known as the facts of life.	6.505856509160792
7185. chabrier's	little one-act operetta presented yesterday afternoon at town hall	is a fragile precious little piece very french not without wit	and charm.	3.1281591391152577
7186. the poor uneducated newlywed a certain gontran de boismassif	has his problems in getting the necessary information.	4.68188318589809
7187. the humor	of the situation can be imagined.	3.743427124794818
7188. it all takes place in the	eighteenth century.	8.099488645620694
7189. what a silly artificial way of life chabrier	and his librettists chuckle.	4.880988130166661
7190. but they wish they could bring it back.	7.648450756702864
7191. chabrier's delightful music stands just at the point where	the classical rationalist tradition	becomes virtually neo-classicism.	3.5868556657605084
7192. the musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste	and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or	mawkish.	4.4735814073853994
7193. the simple clever production was also able to tread	the thin line between those extremes.	3.4720849224585653
7194. arlene saunders was charming as	poor gontran.	6.177610919593842
7195. yes arlene is her name; the work uses the old eighteenth-century	tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced	youth to a soprano.	4.108574080420567
7196. benita valente was delightful as the young wife	and john parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring.	5.049685500896289
7197. the work was presented as the final event in the town	hall festival of music.	3.836360083895188
7198. it was paired with a darius milhaud opera	the poor sailor set to a libretto by jean cocteau a	kind of grand guignol by the sea a sailor returns unrecognized and	gets done in by his wife.	4.566980749410532
7199. with the exception of a few spots	milhaud's music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties	odd harmonies and lumbering satiric orchestration.	3.663609328308803
7200. had a funny experience at newport yesterday afternoon.	7.0344229699924625
7201. sat there	and as a woman sang she kept getting thinner and thinner right	before my eyes and the eyes of some 5500 other people.	3.407856882750699
7202. i make	this observation about the lady miss judy garland because she brought	up the subject herself in telling a story about a british female	reporter who flattered her terribly in london recently and then wrote	in the paper the next day:   judy garland has arrived	in london.	4.560424044156307
7203. she's not plump.	5.465888270309313
7204. but who cares when the lady sings?	7.312366018293836
7205.  certainly not the largest	afternoon audience newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the	most attentive and quiet.	3.7042082091501443
7206. they applauded every number not only at its	conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme- sometimes	at the first chord.	5.819330065586487
7207. and judy sang the lovely old familiar things	which seemed at times a blessed relief from the way-out compositions	of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings.	3.236700494047208
7208. things like when you're smiling almost like being in	love do it again born to wander alone together	who cares?	5.182390855357532
7209.  puttin' on the ritz how	long has this been going on?	3.7795497235247835
7210.  and her own personal songs	like the man that got away and the inevitable over the	rainbow.	6.095348577881544
7211. miss garland is not only one of the great singers	of our time but she is one of the superb showmen.	5.274367426399298
7212. at the start of	her program there were evidences of pique.	7.023733338585185
7213. she had held to the letter	of her contract and didn't come onto the stage until well after 4	pm the appointed hour although the music at newport people had	tried to get the program underway at 3.	3.378260464104183
7214. then there was a bad delay	in getting mort lindsey's 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs.	5.98512492290743
7215. along about 4:30 just when it was getting to be about time	to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side judy	came on singing in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket	that flapped in the wind.	3.677358850156263
7216. her bouffant coiffure was fortunately	combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk	breeze was blowing.	6.106792847063056
7217. in her first song she waved away one	encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter	the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm lenses	and shoot at extreme range.	3.025058022056667
7218. there also came a brief contretemps	with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during	a quiet moment near the conclusion of do it again and	she made the tart observation that i never saw so much moving about	in an audience.	4.985697002023233
7219. but it didn't take judy garland showman	long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at	newport and that you have to learn to live with it.	4.326765955144138
7220. before her chore	was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music trundling	microphones about the stage helping to move the piano and otherwise joining	in the informal atmosphere.	5.142663979397557
7221. and time after time she really	belted out her songs.	4.261732853746731
7222. sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged-	which was the way i felt about her come rain or come	shine- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent like her	shatteringly beautiful beautiful weather.	5.10832663511357
7223. to her partisan	audience such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than	a critic striving to hold his franchise; they just sat back on their	haunches and cried for more as though they could never get enough.	3.2670660423858093
7224. they were rewarded with splendid exciting singing.	6.981891147385843
7225. her rockabye	your baby was as good as it can be done and her really	personal songs like the man that got away were deeply moving.	4.327302814244149
7226. the audience wouldn't let her leave until it had heard	over the rainbow- although the fellow that kept crying for	get happy had to go home unhappy about that item anyway.	4.699209652776099
7227. she	was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with	its cheers and applause and flowers.	3.5514787994986885
7228. all went home happy except	the newport police who feared that the throng departing at 6:35	might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh and those deprived of	their happy hour at the cocktail bar.	4.538487225630382
7229. in newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning	in the northern skies.	3.9318414911497443
7230. this was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the	evening- flashes in the distance but no storm.	5.856367888181108
7231. several times	it came near breaking and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder	from jerry mulligan's big band which is about as fine an aggregation	as has come along in the jazz business since john hammond	found count basie working in a kansas city trap.	3.3385546227087866
7232. mulligan's	band has been infected with his solid sense of swing and what it	does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the	big concert aggregations.	4.984433086876041
7233. but what is equally impressive is	the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and mulligan's	baritone sax in a fragile ballad like bob brookmeyer's arrangement	of django's castle.	3.365977964773434
7234. for subtle swinging rhythms	i could admire intensely mulligan's version of weep and	the fireworks went on display in 18 carrots for robert a sax	tribute to johnny hodges.	4.57953458432219
7235. there was considerable contrast	between this mulligan performance and that of art blakey and the	jazz messengers who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such	a small group.	3.452151158422751
7236. unfortunately blakey doesn't choose to work much	of the time in this vein.	6.485343985629069
7237. he prefers to have his soloist performing	and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like.	3.524063667557388
7238. what we did get however was impressive.	8.230201423846767
7239. a few drops	of rain just before midnight when sarah vaughan was in the midst of	her first number scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly	but at this hour and with sarah on the stand most of the listeners	didn't care whether they got wet.	3.6493586346545275
7240. miss vaughan was back	in top form somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time-	like a fine wine.	5.309160451227623
7241. after the spate of female vocalists we have been	having all of whom took sarah as a point of departure and then tried	to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat it seemed	that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than	ever.	3.631902652699923
7242. the evening program was opened	by the jazz three a newport group consisting of steve budieshein	on bass jack warner drums and don cook piano.	4.511999399306607
7243. this was a	continuation of a good idea which was first tried out saturday night	when the eddie stack group also local talent went on first.	3.5749763052892876
7244. putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple	purpose: it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in	this unenviable spot when the audience is cold restless and in flux;	it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have	come a long way to hear and it gives the resident musicians a chance	to perform before the famous newport audience.	5.008603418995694
7245. the jazz three	displayed their sound musicianship not only in their own chosen set	but as the emergency accompanists for al minns + leon james the	superb jazz dancers who have now been newport performers for three	successive years gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution	of the blues to a spot on the evening program.	3.0110631057952424
7246. sings	julie wilson a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists	sang a set a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old	oldies as hard-hearted hannah the vamp of savannah and	the delightful sunday.	4.613816646240851
7247. she frosted the cake with the always reliable	bill bailey.	4.188759731476242
7248. from this taste of the 1920s we	leaped way out to stan getz's private brand of progressive jazz	which did lovely subtle things for baubles bangles and beads	and a couple of ballards.	5.008409707870513
7249. getz is a difficult musician to categorize.	4.595046008485261
7250. he plays his sax principally for beauty of tone rather than	for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations and he has	a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising	is over.	4.580031046381467
7251. in this he is sticking with tradition however far removed	from it he may seem to be.	3.9128532422948377
7252. george shearing	took over with his well disciplined group a sextet consisting of	vibes guitar bass drums shearing's piano and a bongo drummer.	4.91847453576164
7253. he met with enthusiastic audience approval especially when he swung	from jazz to latin american things like the mambo.	3.6943767075243086
7254. shearing himself	seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent newport	appearances.	6.369566499917956
7255. a very casual pleasant program- one of those	easy-going things that make newport's afternoon programs such a	relaxing delight- was held again under sunny skies hot sun and a fresh	breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came	to newport to hear music rather than go to the beach.	3.3561337941064746
7256. divided	almost equally into two parts it consisted of the evolution of	the blues narrated by jon hendricks who had presented it last	year at the monterey calif jazz festival and an hour-long session	of maynard ferguson and his orchestra a blasting big band.	4.317192257043826
7257. hendricks' story was designed for children and he had a small	audience of small children right on stage with him.	4.177111785157916
7258. tracing the blues	from its african roots among the slaves who were brought to this country	and the west indies he stressed the close relationship between	the early jazz forms and the music of the negro churches.	5.123369582510808
7259. addition	to help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz	he had big miller as a preacher-singer and hannah dean gospel-singer	while oscar brown jr an extremely talented young	man did a slave auctioneer's call a field-hands' work song and	a beautifully sung negro lullaby brown baby which was one of	the truly moving moments of the festival.	2.8399490120528466
7260. one of those delightful	surprise additions which so frequently occur in jazz programs	was an excellent stint at the drums by the great joe jones drumming	to old man river which seems to have been elected the favorite	solo for the boys on the batterie at this year's concerts.	4.999961598266733
7261. demonstrating the primitive african rhythmic backgrounds of the blues	was michael babatunde olatunji who plays such native drums as	the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest.	2.9682802505385997
7262. he	has been on previous newport programs and was one of the sensations of	last year's afternoon concerts.	5.811288005177807
7263. hendricks had billy mitchell	tenor	sax; pony poindexter alto sax; jimmy witherspoon	blues singer and the ike isaacs trio which has done	such wonderful work for two afternoons now helping him with the musical	examples.	3.0573358211173045
7264. it all went very well.	9.000491841873938
7265. pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know	the interesting material contained in schubert's sonatas.	3.600121243230257
7266. music	lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent	example played for rca by emil gilels.	5.026500216917777
7267. he has chosen sonata	op 53 in d.	5.075397348470051
7268. the playing takes both sides of the disc.	6.219556573328471
7269. perhaps	one of the reasons these sonatas are not programmed more often	is their great length.	3.5787441003863423
7270. rhythmic interest melodic beauty and the expansiveness	of the writing are all qualities which hold one's attention	with the gilels playing.	4.772977334406682
7271. his technique is ample and his musical ideas	are projected beautifully.	3.911226731764915
7272. the male chorus of the robert	shaw chorale sings sea shanties in fine style.	4.868475754664245
7273. the group is superbly	trained.	4.6956872395400255
7274. what a discussion can ensue when the title of this type	of song is in question.	6.26995160206631
7275. do you say chantey as if the word were derived	from the french word chanter to sing or do you say shanty and think	of a roughly built cabin which derives its name from the french-canadian	use of the word chantier with one of its meanings given as	a boat-yard?	3.4783433947657088
7276.  i say chantey.	10.654264744814562
7277. either way the robert shaw chorus	sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame	spelled out in terms of agreeable listening.	3.767496852412864
7278. if your favorite song	is not here it must be an unfamiliar one.	6.830106131697787
7279. the london label offers	an operatic recital by ettore bastianini a baritone whose fame	is international.	3.021056582961548
7280. murray louis and his dance company appeared at the henry	street playhouse on friday and saturday evenings and sunday afternoons	in the premiere of his latest work signal and the repetition	of an earlier one journal.	4.628251569051512
7281. signal is choreographed	for three male dancers to an electronic score by alwin nikolais.	3.5569144847343592
7282. its abstract decor is by john hultberg.	7.146530165024237
7283. program note reads	as follows:   take hands h this urgent visage beckons us.	3.4010053955789767
7284. here as in journal mr louis has given himself	the lion's share of the dancing and there is no doubt that he is	capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting	physical movements.	5.7477240979698285
7285. indeed both journal and signal	qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics.	3.8575418405091786
7286. but chains of movements are not necessarily communicative and	it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing.	6.202235900619695
7287. one frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations	could be transposed without notable loss of effect there is	too little suggestion of organic relationship and development.	3.5477484065051113
7288. it may be of course that mr louis is consciously trying to create	works that anticipate an age of total automation.	6.072000870046813
7289. but it may be	also that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics	at the present time.	4.1132111419676205
7290. one thing is certain however and that is that	he is far more slavish to the detailed accents phrasings and contours	of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be.	5.3335969568537624
7291. a brisk satirical spoof of contemporary	american mores entitled an american journey was given its	first new york performance at hunter college playhouse last night	by the helen tamiris-daniel nagrin dance company.	2.870611677199631
7292. choreographed	by mr nagrin the work filled the second half of a program that	also offered the first new york showing of miss tamiris' once	upon a time h as well as her women's song and	mr nagrin's indeterminate figure.	5.150467066857549
7293. eugene lester	assembled a witty and explicit score for an american journey	and malcolm mccormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes.	3.207974468866842
7294. mr nagrin has described four places each with its scenery	and people added two diversions and concluded with a	toccata for the young a refreshingly underplayed interpretation	of rock'n'roll dancing.	4.735196701675775
7295. the places could be anywhere	the idiosyncrasies	and foibles observed there could be anybody's and	the laugh is on us all.	3.168613647768616
7296. but we need not mind too much because mr	nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever	almost all the way.	5.4468990650045255
7297. miss tamiris' once upon a time	h is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three figures	that bother them somehow.	4.067941045580779
7298. unfortunately the man and	woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the	menacing figures failed to make them any more so.	5.522907633469114
7299. nor did the dancing	involved really seize the attention at any time.	4.37697292790572
7300. the music here russell	smith's tetrameron sounded good.	5.833992132486045
7301. all the performances	of the evening were smooth and assured and the sizable company	with mr nagrin and marion scott as its leading dancers seemed	to be fine shape.	3.2733060998365
7302. the symphony of the air greatly assisted by van cliburn	last night got its seven-concert beethoven cycle at carnegie hall	off to a good start.	4.519374407493815
7303. at the same time the orchestra announced that	next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at carnegie and	that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs repeating each	of them in five different communities.	3.749960612976649
7304. this news announced	by jerome toobin the orchestra's administrative director brought	applause from the 2800 persons who filled the hall.	4.796198481245575
7305. they showed they	were glad that carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there	so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to lincoln	center of the new york philharmonic the philadelphia orchestra	and the boston symphony.	3.612020982831285
7306. this season the orchestra has already	taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription	concerts for the orchestral society of westchester in the county	center in white plains.	5.305159977608479
7307. the details of the suburban concerts	next season and the centers in which they will be given will be announced	later mr toobin said.	3.8462639669149943
7308. the concertos that van	cliburn has been associated with in new york since his triumphant return	from russia in 1958 have been the tchaikovsky the rachmaninoff	third and the prokofieff third.	5.062149502558101
7309. it was pleasant last night therefore	to hear him do something else: a concerto he has recently recorded	the emperor.	3.5504058755121872
7310. the young texas pianist can make	great chords ring out as well as anyone so last night the massive sonorities	of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him.	5.095487906758098
7311. but they	were not what distinguished his performance.	4.526521793034464
7312. the elements that did	were the introspective slow movement the beautiful transition to the	third movement and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger	moments of the opening movement and the final rondo.	4.725487177060838
7313. mr	cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a chopin nocturne.	4.807431161232854
7314. alfred wallenstein the conductor sensitive accompanist that	he is picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of	broodinf poetic mystery.	5.418652623020028
7315. the collaboration was remarkable as it was	in both the other movements too.	3.3546763334416703
7316. mr wallenstein who	will lead all of the concerts in the cycle also conducted the leonore	overture no 3 and the fourth symphony.	5.677953092890272
7317. the orchestra	was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively.	3.3648292257202472
7318. and although	there was plenty of vigor in the performance the ensemble was at	its best when the playing was soft and lyrical yet full of the suppressed	tension that is one of the hallmarks of beethoven.	5.146802059984253
7319. igor oistrakh	will be the next soloist on feb 4.	4.022780597074918
7320. there are times when one suspects that the songs that are	dropped from musical shows before they reach broadway may really be	better than many of those that are left in.	5.120865023017573
7321. today in the era of the	integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all	development of the show it is understandable that a song no matter	how excellent it may be on its own terms is cut out because it does	not perform the function required of it.	3.4609052685827986
7322. in the more casually	constructed musicals of the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties	there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song	of merit.	5.755010865313526
7323. yet there is the classic case of the gershwins' the	man i love.	5.218215308918048
7324. deemed too static when it was first heard in lady	be good in philadelphia in 1924 it was dropped from the score.	5.665093645125524
7325. it was heard again in philadelphia in 1927 in the first version	of strike up the band and again abandoned shortly before the	entire show was given up.	3.876430408698506
7326. it finally reached broadway in the second	and successful version of strike up the band in 1929.	5.847490646528382
7327. another song in strike up the band- i've got a crush	like the gershwins richard rodgers and	lorenz hart were loath to let a good song get away from them.	3.2893420593875704
7328. if one	of mr rodgers' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than	interment in boston or the obscurity of a broadway failure mr hart	was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance	in another show.	4.896483439672726
7329. several of these double entries have been	collected by ben bagley and michael mcwhinney along with rodgers	and hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to new york	and others that reached broadway but have not become part of the constantly	heard rodgers and hart repertory in a delightfully refreshing	album	.	3.2307682955535597
7330. among the particular gems in this collection	is the impudent opening song of the garrick gaieties	an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from	rodgers and hart in the years that followed; dorothy loudon's	raucous listing of the attractions at the roxy music hall from	i married an angel; and the incisive style with which charlotte	rae delivers the top-drawer hart lyrics of i blush	a song that was cut from a connecticut yankee.	4.305283414389803
7331. altogether	fifteen virtually unknown rodgers and hart songs are sung by	a quintet of able vocalists.	3.422737591141066
7332. norman paris has provided them with extremely	effective orchestral accompanimen   turning to the current	musical season on broadway the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals		has been transferred to an original cast album	that has some entertaining	moments although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited	by the show might lead one to expect.	4.635173849216413
7333. robert morse singing with comically	plaintive earnestness carries most of the burden and is responsible	for the high spots in frank loesser's score.	3.819968732598289
7334. rudy	vallee who shares star billing with mr morse makes only two	appearances.	5.620301121028176
7335. he shares with mr morse a parody of the college anthems	he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by virginia	martin a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice.	3.30800630130164
7336. in general mr loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist	than he has as composer.	5.865350131237405
7337. like mr loesser jerry herman	is both composer and lyriist for	c	but in this	case it is the music that stands above the lyrics.	3.75399412615794
7338. for this story of	an american couple who meet and fall in love in israel mr herman	has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles.	5.057519750198773
7339. there are the full-bodied resourceful	voices of robert weede mimi benzell and tommy rall to make the	most of mr herman's lilting melodies and for an occasional	change of pace the bright humor of molly picon.	3.1241504333024674
7340. mr herman has	managed to mix musical ideas drawn from israel and the standard american	ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both	idioms.	5.315616978026578
7341. not content to create only the music and lyrics noe^l	coward also wrote the book and directed	a saga of life on a	cruise ship that is not apt to be included among mr coward's more	memorable works.	3.5829562246200415
7342. the melodies flow along pleasantly as mr coward's	songs usually do but his lyrics have a tired cut-to-a-familiar-pattern	quality.	4.638560212322915
7343. elaine stritch who sings with a persuasively	warm huskiness belts some life into most of her songs but the other	members of the cast sound as lukewarm as mr coward's songs.	3.3333405487052543
7344. with three fine russian films in recent months on world	war 2- the house i live in the cranes are flying	and ballad of a soldier- we had every right to expect	a real soviet block-buster in the day the war ended.	5.144566562328256
7345. it	simply isn't not by a long shot.	4.415500016413086
7346. the artkino presentation with english	titles opened on saturday at the cameo theatre.	4.913354865132772
7347. make no mistake this gorky studio drama is a respectable import-	aptly grave carefully	written performed and directed.	3.6406877796285753
7348. in describing the initial allied	occupation of a middle-sized german city the picture has color pictorial	pull and genuinely moving moments.	5.0205795467817
7349. told strictly from the viewpoint	of the russian conquerors the film compassionately peers over	the shoulders of a smitten soviet couple at both sides of the conflict's	aftermath.	3.303632052493617
7350. unfortunately the whole picture hinges on this	romance at the expense of everything else.	6.366849611601042
7351. tenderly and rather tediously	the camera rivets on the abrupt deep love of a pretty nurse	and a uniformed teacher complicated by nothing more than a friend they	don't want to hurt.	3.31099087600638
7352. it's the old story war or no war and more	than one viewer may recall hollywood's titanic several seasons	back when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of	a society dilettante.	4.5949815745010625
7353. not that the picture is superficial.	6.632468347062738
7354. under	yakov segal's direction it begins stirringly as crouching soviet	and nazi troops silently scan each other waiting for the first	surrender gesture.	4.7503023758847025
7355. one high-up camera shot is magnificent as the germans	straggle from a cathedral dotting a huge cobblestone square	and drop their weapons.	3.298619014892247
7356. only	once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic	sense of sharing a rare experience.	5.537910761257431
7357. ring of bright water by	gavin maxwell is just that- a haunting warmly personal chronicle	of a man an otter and a remote cottage in the scottish west highlands.	3.150820486357397
7358. he has married me with h a ring of bright	water	begins the kathleen raine poem from which maxwell takes his title	and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the	author conveys.	4.923022439297269
7359. the place is camusfearna the site of a long-vanished	sea-village opposite the isle of skye.	3.6232928302209992
7360. it is a land of long fjords	few people a single-lane road miles away- and of wild stags greylag	geese wild swans dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters.	4.786137909059644
7361. how maxwell recounts his first coming to camusfearna his furnishing	the empty house with beach-drift the subtle changes in season over	ten years is a moving experience.	3.3103122897341866
7362. just the evocations of time and	place of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today	seems almost lost would be enough.	5.513295108338342
7363. there	is mijbil an otter who travelled with maxwell- and gave maxwell's	name to a new species- from the tigris marshes to his london	flat.	3.504728882445773
7364. it may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more	engaging animal in all literature.	6.969942604360995
7365. this is not only a compliment to	mijbil of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings	in the book but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened	otter cub's journey by plane from iraq to london then by train	to camusfearna with affectionate detail.	3.398879469504985
7366. mij as his owner	was soon to learn had strange inexplicable habits.	5.577968541375415
7367. he liked to nip	ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth.	3.73380723430606
7368. he preferred	sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow.	6.47772925455831
7369. systematically he	would open and ransack drawers.	4.346628603041096
7370. given a small ball or marbles he would	invent games and play by himself for hours.	5.395255741890352
7371. with curiosity and elan	he explored every inch of glen beach and burn once stranding himself	for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting	with calm faith to be rescued by maxwell who nearly lost his life	in doing so.	2.9041306496223984
7372. a year and a day of this idyll is described for the	reader one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality	is charted but self-discovery as well.	5.86017130150897
7373. in the solitude of camusfearna	there had been no loneliness.	4.155771452234115
7374. to be quite alone where there	are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating; it is as though some	pressure had suddenly been lifted allowing an intense awareness h	a sharpening of the senses.	4.960371287806117
7375. now with the increasing interdependence	between himself and mij came a knowledge of an obscure need	that of being trusted implicitly by some creature.	3.664906825012969
7376. two other people	in time shared mijbil's love: h it remained around us three	that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable	world of wave and water h; we were his trinity and he behaved	towards us h with a mixture of trust and abuse passion and irritation.	5.002180393997986
7377. in turn each of us in our own way depended as gods do upon his	worship.	4.354736657106298
7378. the brief details of mijbil's	death lend depth to the story give it an edge of ironic tragedy.	4.939400665127349
7379. man to whom mij gave endless affection and fealty was responsible	in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract	symbol of the savage in man.	3.356849478725536
7380. but then through a strange coincidence	maxwell manages to acquire idal a female otter and the fascinating	story starts once more.	5.177354077123077
7381. one is not sure who emerges as	the main personality of this book- mijbil with his rollicking ways	or maxwell himself poet portrait painter writer journalist traveller	and zoologist sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an	unusual way of life in a language at once lyrical and forceful vivid	and unabashed.	3.17748744560268
7382. this reviewer read the book when it was first brought	out in england with a sense of discovery and excitement.	6.316253089257168
7383. now gavin	maxwell's ring of bright water has widened to enchant the world.	3.878393892418657
7384. the performances of the comedie francaise are the	most important recent events in the new york theater.	6.017608730192569
7385. they	serve to contradict a popular notion that the comedie merely repeats	as accurately as possible the techniques of acting the classics that	prevailed in the 17th century.	3.3614822652668583
7386. on the contrary the old plays are continually	being reinterpreted and each new production of a classic has	only a brief history at the comedie.	5.326515318056286
7387. of course the well-received	revivals last longer than the others and that further reminds	us that the comedie is not insensitive to criticism.	4.068074289817411
7388. the directors of	the comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient	a manner as the broadway producers who in two instances this	season closed their plays after one performance.	4.4888331635487475
7389. but they are aware	of the world outside they court public approval they delight in full	houses and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic	classic.	3.4280061938668562
7390. in france novel approaches to the classic french	plays are frequently attempted.	6.171845143322469
7391. the government pays a subsidy	for revival of the classics and this policy attracts experimenters who	sometimes put moliere's characters in modern dress and often achieve	interesting results.	3.1327964513123514
7392. so far as i know the comedie has never	put moliere's people in the costumes of the 20th century but	they do reinterpret plays and characters.	6.052057158350157
7393. last season the comedie's	two principal experiments came to grief and in consequence we can	expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of racine's phedre	and moliere's school for wives.	3.2532464638126544
7394. the new	phedre was done in 17th century setting instead of ancient greek;	perhaps that is the comedie's equivalent for thrusting this	play's characters into our own time.	4.794803610095006
7395. the speaking of the lines seemed	excessively slow and stately possibly in an effort to capture the	spirit of 17th century elegance.	3.4704930705246646
7396. a few literary men defended what they	took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama but	the response was mainly hostile and quite violent.	5.417581241290952
7397. the new school	for wives was interpreted according to a principle that	is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy- the	idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character.	3.1789364938091116
7398. among the moliere specialists of some years ago louis	jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns while fernand ledoux	often performing at the comedie made them more gross than moliere may	have intended.	5.297363488932464
7399. apparently jouvet and ledoux attempted just	these dissimilar approaches in the role of arnolphe in the school	for wives.	3.720162641623299
7400. i say apparently although i saw jouvet as	arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death; by	that time he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments	of the comedy.	5.508156990520024
7401. arnolphe it will be recalled is a man	of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be.	3.862199076297867
7402. the part can lend itself to serious treatment; one influential	french critic remarked: pity for arnolphe comes with age.	4.625786475428433
7403. accordingly at the comedie last year jean meyer played	a sympathetic arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into	a tragedy.	3.493228442614551
7404. but the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the	play became only comedy acted rather slowly.	5.296566760374926
7405. wisely the comedie	has brought moliere's tartuffe on its tour and has left	the school for wives at home.	3.408717697493629
7406. tartuffe is the religious hypocrite	who courts his benefactor's wife.	5.762587174401684
7407. jouvet played him as a sincere	zealot and ledoux at the comedie made him a gross buffoon or	so the historians tell us.	3.542105344914553
7408. louis seigner who formerly played	the deluded benefactor opposite ledoux is the tartuffe of the present	production which he himself directed.	5.101543982959975
7409. his tartuffe observes the	golden mean.	4.647124019633302
7410. his red face his coarse gestures and his lustful stares	bespeak his sensuality.	5.342863957831653
7411. but his heavenward glances and his pious	speeches are not merely perfunctory; of course they do not reflect	sincerity but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his	pious impersonation.	3.929105854456177
7412. occasionally seigner draws some justly	deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another.	5.349243628361775
7413. the	whole role by the way is a considerable transformation for anyone	who has seen seigner in his other parts.	3.8504380502868973
7414. his normal specialty is playing	the good-natured old man frequently stupid or deluded but never	mean or sly.	4.816089520128649
7415. here he is quite persuasively the very embodiment of	meanness and slyness.	4.2418134004403525
7416. seigner is the dean of the company the	oldest actor in point of continuous service.	6.808186700761992
7417. in that function he helps	to rebut another legend about the comedie.	4.049105005622867
7418. we are often told that	the comedie has unfortunately life-contracts with old actors who	are both mediocre and lazy drawing their pay without much acting but	probably doing real service to the comedie by staying off the stage.	4.66616972017307
7419. seigner however is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the	company; among his other parts are the leads in the bourgeois	gentleman and the imaginary invalid.	3.566460797961517
7420. in moliere's	farce the tricks of scapin robert hirsch undertakes	another of the great roles.	5.812984515912749
7421. here some innovation is attempted.	5.644979847421071
7422. to begin with scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever	servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master.	5.44202811286215
7423. hirsch's	scapin is healthy cheerful energetic revelling in his physical	agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he	serves.	3.34623529932128
7424. hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities	he has observed in the city toughs of the real world.	6.752495451018796
7425. and surely	his scapin has a fresh directness a no-nonsense quality that seems to	make him his own master and nobody's servant.	3.369307903067561
7426. django reinhardt the ill-fated gypsy was a true artist	one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and	flow into many channels.	4.986747185829432
7427. there is hardly a jazz guitarist in	the business today who doesn't owe something to django.	3.889583314444575
7428. and django	owed much to louis armstrong.	7.032193326601889
7429. he told once of how he switched his	style of playing to jazz after listening to two old armstrong records	he bought in the flea market in paris.	3.3539116452505926
7430. it was the first jazz he	had heard.	8.536939536254566
7431. django who was born jean baptiste reinhardt in	belgium and who died in 1953 in france was an extraordinary man.	3.5457940513370594
7432. most	of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep	with a cigarette.	5.5185491880279915
7433. and this was before he began to play his startlingly	beautiful jazz.	5.311277542499436
7434. you can catch up with him- if you haven't	already- on rca-victor's album.	6.114349496566512
7435. djangology made	up of tracks he recorded with stephane grappelly and the quintet of	the hot club of france.	3.246039769435172
7436. this is a choice item and grappely deserves	mention too of course.	6.183248203165
7437. he is one of the few men in history who	plays jazz on a violin.	4.7097849194179275
7438. they play: minor swing honeysuckle	rose beyond the sea bricktop heavy	artillery djangology after you've gone where	are you my love?	4.8079435890110265
7439.  i saw stars lover man	menilmontant and swing 42.	4.51465025293271
7440. all this is great	proceedings- get the minutes.	8.210489476156702
7441. kid ory the trombonist chicken	farmer is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz.	3.9825840212684467
7442. he dates	back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into new orleans.	5.95638772750544
7443. his horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years	than he cares to remember.	3.4542287683365744
7444. good time jazz has released a nice	two-record album which he made.	6.028116554872487
7445. he is starred against alvin alcorn	trumpet; phil gomez clarinet; cedric haywood piano; julian	davidson guitar; wellman braud bass and minor hall drums.	3.0783557097822243
7446. the set contains high society do what ory	say down home rag careless love jazz me blues	weary blues original dixieland one-step bourbon	street parade panama toot toot tootsie	oh didn't he ramble beale street blues maryland	my maryland 1919 rag eh la bas mood	indigo and bugle call rag.	3.7831084230187986
7447. all this will serve	to show off the ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those	who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late	to lay hands on the gems.	3.7359078113104283
7448. mischa elman shared last night's lewisohn stadium concert	with three american composers.	5.217389285003896
7449. his portion of the program-	and a big portion it was- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century	concertos for the violin: to wit the mendelssohn and the	tchaikovsky.	3.3490391419237264
7450. that is an evening of music-making that would faze many	a younger man; mr elman is 70 years old.	5.386833193905567
7451. there were	8000 persons at the stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they	heard elman.	4.278739330541748
7452. but with all due respects and allowances it must	truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet	more mannered than musical.	5.344641588116584
7453. the occasion was sentimental; so was the	playing.	3.7560248322550485
7454. the american part of the evening consisted of paul	creston's dance overture william schuman's chester	from new england triptych and two works of wallingford riegger	dance rhythms	op 58 and a romanza for strings op	56a.	4.844650838891252
7455. the creston is purely a potboiler with spanish english	french and american dances mixed into the stew.	3.075762338318606
7456. the riegger	with its latin hesitation bounce is just this side of the pale;	like his sweet attractive romanza it belongs to what the composer	called his non-dissonant category of works.	4.608914026641952
7457. the schuman	chester takes off from an old william billings tune with	rousing woodwind and brass effect.	3.0492548148162384
7458. all these- potboilers	or no- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively	colorful unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors.	5.479027612733996
7459. it	was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change.	4.176057033241163
7460. we have	alfredo antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well	as the lively performances of the stadium symphony.	5.325167309459587
7461. a woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the	wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of a question of adultery	yesterday's new british import at the apollo.	3.3228925588785625
7462. since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation	that would often arise the film's extensive discussion of the	problem seems at best superfluous.	5.603210604338048
7463. in its present artless low-budget	form the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath.	3.966292600718298
7464. with julie london enacting the central role with husky-voiced	sincerity the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive.	5.664089181744921
7465. the explanation	offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage	to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile	accident.	3.33716786781292
7466. anthony steel as the husband is a jealous type	who argues against her course and sues for divorce labeling her action	adulterous.	4.959477544190961
7467. the actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction	of don chaffey as do basil sydney as his unsympathetic father	and anton diffring as an innocent bystander.	2.9464460004246
7468. after a protracted	hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language	than for dramatic credibility the jury to no one's surprise	leaves the legal question unresolved.	4.975448831851064
7469. when the husband drops the case	and returns to his wife both seem sorry they brought the matter up in	the first place.	3.705577873547468
7470. for its final change of bill in its london season	the leningrad state kirov ballet chose tonight to give one	of those choreographic miscellanies known as a gala program at the	royal opera house covent garden.	4.813623606096751
7471. no doubt the underlying idea	was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished	its presentations thus far it too could give a circus if it pleased.	3.8345276117417715
7472. and please it did in every sense of the word for it had	the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical	of london audiences.	6.939892560476966
7473. at the end of the program indeed there was a	demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes and nothing could stop	it.	4.146803689706871
7474. alexandre livshitz repeated a fantastic	technical bit from the closing number taras bulba but even	then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined	not to go home at all.	4.925495808644187
7475. only a plea from the house manager john collins	finally broke up the party.	4.549148766039736
7476. but for all the manifest	intention to show off this was a circus with a difference for	instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level	it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company.	6.284843086216712
7477. the taras bulba excerpt is a rousing version of	gogol's ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by bo fenster to music	of soloviev-sedoi.	2.907467749443151
7478. it is danced by some thirty-five men and no women	and it contains everything in the books- lusty comedy gregarious	cavorting and tricks that only madmen or russians would attempt	to make the human body perform.	4.847714051464872
7479. yuri soloviev oleg sokolov alexei	zhitkov lev sokolov yuri korneyev and mr livshitz were the	chief soloists but everybody on stage was magnificent.	3.011744834750407
7480. at	the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the petipa-minkus	ballet bayaderka which opened the evening.	5.306683270480298
7481. what	a man this petipa was! and why do we in the west know so few of	his ballets?	3.7908390653363204
7482.  this scene is a white ballet in which a lovelorn	hero searches for his departed love's spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily	beautiful shadows who can all dance like nothing human-	which of course is altogether fitting.	4.914117003397834
7483. the ensemble enters	in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty as well as loveliness	and adagio is the general medium of the piece.	3.3368730396953623
7484. its	ballerina olga moiseyeva performs simple miracles of beauty and	ludmilla alexeyeva inna korneyeva and gabrielle komleva make	up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments.	4.272296955351084
7485. sergei vikulov as the	lone male meets the competition well with some brilliant hits but the	work is designed to belong to the ladies.	3.525252357156299
7486. the middle section	of the program was made up of short numbers naturally enough of unequal	merit but all of them pretty good at that.	5.485305598059209
7487. they consisted of a new	arrangement of nutcracker excerpts danced stunningly by irina	kolpakova and mr sokolev with a large ensemble; a winning	little snow maiden variation by the adorable galina kekisheva;	two of those poetic adagios in greek veils	by alla osipenko and igor chernishev in one case and inna	zubkovskaya and yuri kornevey in the other; an amusing character	pas de cinq called gossiping women; a stirring flames	of paris pas de deux by xenia ter-stepanova and alexandre pavlovsky	and a lovely version of fokine's le cygne by olga	moiseyeva which had to be repeated.	2.7010114011511117
7488. vadim kalentiev was the	conductor.	7.188675562465977
7489. it was quite an evening!	a year ago today when the democrats were fretting and frolicking	in los angeles and john f kennedy was still only an	able and ambitious senator who yearned for the power and responsibility	of the presidency theodore h white had already compiled masses	of notes about the presidential campaign of 1960.	3.1681569126328513
7490. as the	pace of the quadrennial american political festival accelerated mr	white took more notes.	5.415733288842058
7491. he traveled alternately with mr kennedy	and with richard m nixon.	3.90324745824684
7492. he asked intimate questions	and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates'	in-groups.	6.888463448690074
7493. he assembled quantities of facts about the nature	of american politics in general as well as about the day-to-day course	of the closest presidential election in american history.	3.541774868484425
7494. those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about	that election; how little we know of what there is to be known is	made humiliatingly clear by mr white in the making of the president	1960.	6.094827670153941
7495. this is a remarkable book and an astonishingly	interesting one.	4.721603059561039
7496. what might have been only warmed-over topical journalism	turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history.	7.273107371757744
7497. mr	white who is only a competent novelist is a brilliant reporter.	4.238339450344386
7498. his	zest for specific detail his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere	his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the	effectiveness of his book.	4.574494129581065
7499. as a dramatic	narrative the making of the president 1960 is continuously	engrossing.	5.079599083459523
7500. and as an introduction to american politics it is highly	educational.	7.851746426291765
7501. the author begins this volume with a close-up of mr	kennedy his family and his entourage waiting for the returns.	3.5611829427556265
7502. he then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal presidential	hopefuls: five democrats- senator hubert h humphrey	senator stuart symington senator lyndon b johnson adlai	e stevenson and mr kennedy- and two republicans- governor	rockefeller and mr nixon.	4.533203014407036
7503. then in chronological	order mr white covers the primary campaigns the conventions and	the presidential campaign itself.	3.7746992614586614
7504. in the process he writes at length	about many related matters: the importance of race religion local	tradition bosses organizations zealous volunteers and television.	5.329695475843762
7505. mr white is bluntly frank in his personal opinions.	4.526193140184918
7506. he frequently	cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse's	mouth from numerous insiders and from mr kennedy himself; but	never from mr nixon who looked on reporters with suspicion and	distrust.	4.542813784060764
7507. rarely in american history has there been a political	campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less	says mr white.	3.3583874721804556
7508. mr nixon he believes has no particular political	philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign.	5.814674540223299
7509. although a skillful	politician and a courageous and honest man mr nixon mr white	believes ignored his own top-level planners wasted time and effort	in the wrong regions missed opportunities through indecision and	damaged his chances on television.	3.078007974517323
7510. mr nixon is a broody	moody man given to long stretches of introspection; he trusts only	himself and his wife.	5.292959264065378
7511. h he is a man of major talent- but a man	of solitary uncertain impulses.	5.124003730102979
7512. h he was above all a friend seeker	almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked.	5.982431790067056
7513. he wanted to identify	with people and have a connection with them; h the least inspiring	candidate since alfred m landon.	3.850149426560633
7514. mr kennedy	mr white believes had mastered politics on so many different	levels that no other	american could match him.	5.059462444894224
7515. calm dignified composed	superbly eloquent mr kennedy always knew everything	about everybody.	3.6206699684739507
7516. he enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous	volunteers.	5.913256535865933
7517. every decision was made quickly on sound grounds.	4.793710551153753
7518. efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance.	6.160497200387694
7519. mr kennedy	did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters.	3.851255130582773
7520. mr white admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a	democrat himself who expects mr kennedy to be a fine president.	6.233266398239648
7521. throughout the making of a president	mr white shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on	candidates how decisions have constantly to be made how fatigue and	illness and nervous strain wear candidates down how subordinates play	key roles.	3.228209117556733
7522. and he makes many interesting comments.	8.294099620530583
7523. here are several:	the root question in american politics is always:	who's the man to see?	4.228045062805565
7524.  to understand american politics is simply	to know people to know the relative weight of names- who are	heroes who are straw men who controls who does not.	5.2037426282627885
7525. but to operate	in american politics one must go a step further- one must build a	bridge to such names establish a warmth a personal connection.	3.5958902448930354
7526. in the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform	nor any program advanced by either major american party has any purpose	beyond expressing emotion.	5.356767096667982
7527. all platforms are meaningless:	the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience	of the candidate the party chooses to lead it.	3.4890788853462187
7528. nostalgia week at lewisohn stadium which had begun with	the appearance of the 70-year-old mischa elman on tuesday night	continued last night as lily pons led the list of celebrities in an	evening of french operatic excerpts.	4.818990366647637
7529. miss pons is certainly	not	70-no singer ever is- and yet the rewards of the evening again	lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in	present accomplishments.	3.541256610362538
7530. the better part of gallantry might be perhaps	to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown	and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which	she had chosen to sing.	4.569037855603804
7531. no orchestra however could be expected	to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as	miss pons encountered last night.	3.4234812605508806
7532. in all fairness there were flashes	of the great stylist of yesteryear flashes even of the old consummate	vocalism.	6.119566640495159
7533. one such moment came in the breathtaking way	miss pons sang the cadenza to meyerbeer's shadow song.	3.8274332780531006
7534. the years suddenly fell away at this point.	5.599131204463355
7535. on the whole however one	must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch	her own reputation as time marches inexorably on.	3.7988960213931464
7536. sharing	the program was the young french-canadian tenor richard verreau	making his stadium debut on this occasion.	5.1365382479445865
7537. mr verreau began shakily	with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed	beyond middle volume.	3.404559644870544
7538. later on this problem vanished and the flower	song from bizet's carmen was beautifully and intelligently	projected.	5.623892517514683
7539. radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach	the minority listener.	3.8860789483129325
7540. lower costs and a larger number of stations	are the key factors making such specialization possible.	5.441730555917748
7541. the	mushrooming of fm outlets offering concerts	lectures and other special events is a phenomenon which has had	a fair amount of publicity.	3.2386327268099313
7542. not so well known is the growth	of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at negro listeners-	an audience which in the united states comprises some 19000000	people with $20000000000 to spend each year.	5.396935988385405
7543. of course	the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching.	4.696690766137626
7544. he even	buys a lot of the products he sees advertised- despite the fact that	the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any	but white models in commercials.	5.128313619585877
7545. but the growing number of	negro-appeal radio stations plus evidence of strong listener support	of their advertisers give time salesmen an impressive argument as they	approach new prospects.	3.220341869196137
7546. it is estimated that more than 600 stations	do a significant amount of programing for the	negro.	6.123208267078729
7547. at least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this	audience in about half of the 50 states.	4.593155810743124
7548. these and other figures	and comments have been reported in a special supplement of sponsor	magazine a trade publication for radio and tv advertisers.	5.466243023047481
7549. for	10 years sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics	of the negro market and of successful techniques for reaching	this market through radio.	3.547897617629826
7550. in the past 10 years sponsor	observes these trends have become apparent:  negro population	in the us has increased 25 per cent while the white population	was growing by 18 per cent.	5.313483996301653
7551. the forgotten 15 million- as	sponsor tagged the negro market in its first survey- has become	a better-remembered 19 million.	3.229716989379853
7552. advertisers are changing their	attitudes both as to the significance of this market and the ways	of speaking to it.	5.964069972445262
7553. stations programing to negro listeners	are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational	economic and cultural levels.	3.542428291953295
7554. futhermore the station which	wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement	projects not simply serve on the air.	4.892921584383793
7555. in the last decade	the number of negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15	per cent and the number of negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per	cent according to a research man quoted by sponsor.	3.5651329165973404
7556. a year	ago the negro radio association was formed to spur research which	the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business.	4.906317194436217
7557. the 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population	growth.	3.938503111408419
7558. it also brought home proof of something a casual observer	might have missed: that more than half of the us negroes live	outside the southeastern states.	6.28690240954554
7559. also the state with the largest	number of negroes is new york- not in the south at all.	4.691381276177873
7560. in new york city wlib boasts more community service programs	than any other negro station and one of the largest negro	news staffs in america.	6.051673513601804
7561. and wwrl's colorful mobile unit	cruising predominately negro neighborhoods is a frequent reminder	of that station's round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests.	3.208271330523553
7562. recently wwrl won praise for its expose of particular cases	of employment agency deceit.	5.54805010543386
7563. a half-dozen other stations in the new	york area also bid for attention of the city's negro population	up about 50 per cent in the past decade.	3.655111410051676
7564. in all big cities outside	the south and even in small towns within the south radio stations	can be found beaming some or all of their programs at negro listeners.	5.420024674616919
7565. the keystone broadcasting system's negro network includes	360 affiliated stations whose signals reach more than half the total	us negro population.	3.0829007443370635
7566. one question which inevitably	crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the	negro is moving into a fully integrated status.	5.356814509747221
7567. whatever the	long-range impact of integration the owners of negro-appeal radio stations	these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal.	4.287585183637086
7568. advertisers	have discovered the tendency of negroes to shop for brand names	they have heard on stations catering to their special interests.	5.0536116841485486
7569. and many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a negro	disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words working only	from a fact sheet.	3.6544506850170997
7570. what sets negro-appeal programing apart from	other radio shows?	6.372153437167899
7571.  sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular	negro bands and singers; rhythm-and-blues mood music; race	music folk songs and melodies and gospel programs.	3.1274311773726025
7572. furthermore news	and special presentations inform the listener about groups projects	and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station.	4.977697636206496
7573. advertising	copy frequently takes into account matters of special negro	concern.	3.9992710209430635
7574. sponsor quotes john mclendon of the mclendon-ebony	station group as saying that the southern negro is becoming conscious	of quality and and does not wish to be associated with radio	which is any way degrading to his race; he tends to shy away from the	hooting and hollering personalities that originally made negro radio	programs famous.	4.621751432296216
7575. the sociological impact is perhaps most	eloquently summed up in this quotation of j walter carroll of ksan	san francisco:   negro-appeal radio is more important	to the negro today because it provides a direct and powerful	mirror in which the negro can hear and see his ambitions achievements	and desires.	3.0426475944049423
7576. it will continue to be important as a means of orientation	to the negro seeking to become urbanized as he tries to make	adjustment to the urban life.	6.299835005902278
7577. negro radio is vitally necessary during	the process of assimilation.	4.159495555720809
7578. presentation of the life and times of john sloan in	the delaware art center here suggests a current nostalgia for human	values in art.	5.09644605537742
7579. staged by way of announcing the gift of a large	and intimate sloan collection by the artist's widow helen farr	sloan to the wilmington society of the fine arts the exhibition	presents a survey of sloan's work.	3.3238742653962943
7580. from early family portraits	painted before he entered the schools of the pennsylvania academy of	the fine arts the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed	in his last year and still part of his estate.	5.6906779518575235
7581. few	artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they	lived.	4.0703847282403975
7582. few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with	so little bitterness.	6.2295328786093584
7583. the paintings drawings prints and illustrations	all reflect the manners costumes and mores of america in the first	half of the present century.	3.293312393943973
7584. obviously sloan's early years	were influenced by his close friend robert henri.	5.956181839891066
7585. as early as	1928 however the sloan style began to change.	4.376023636195977
7586. the dark pigments of	the early work were superseded by a brighter palette.	4.879385052832852
7587. the solidity of	brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual	abandonment of american genres in favor of single figure studies	and studio nudes.	3.014177523868055
7588. the exhibition presents all phases of sloan's	many-sided art.	5.711453965336257
7589. in addition to the paintings are drawings prints	and illustrations.	4.717166105169345
7590. sloan created such works for newspaper supplements	before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the	streets of new york thereby building for america an incomparable	city survey from paintings of mcsorley's saloon to breezy clotheslines	on city roofs.	4.792793295405954
7591. one of the most appealing of the rooftop	canvases is sun and wind on the roof with a woman and child	bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds.	3.682862590361517
7592. although	there are landscapes in the show	the human element was the compelling	factor in sloan's art.	5.222324350416596
7593. significant are such canvases as	bleeker street saturday night with its typically american	crowd; the multifigure traveling carnival	in which action is vivified by lighting; or carmine	theater 1912 the only canvas with an ash can	although sloan was a member of the famous eight and of the	so-called ash-can school a term he resented.	2.994293770258562
7594. not all	the paintings however are of cities.	7.506854469302498
7595. the exhibition touches briefly	on his sojourn in the southwest	indian dance and landscapes suggest the influence of western	.	3.3811952691581717
7596. the fact that sloan was an extrovert	concerned primarily with what he saw adds greatly to the value of his	art as a human chronicle.	5.732690960617218
7597. there are 151 items in the wilmington	show including one painting by each member of the eight	as well as work by sloan's friends and students.	3.6726037123034008
7598. supplementing the	actual art are memorabilia- correspondence diaries books from the	artist's library etc.	4.998377031417038
7599. all belong to the collection being given	to wilmington over a period of years by mrs sloan who has cherished	such revelatory items ever since she first studied with sloan at	the art students league new york in the 1920's.	3.4133202744314555
7600. to	enable students and the public to spot sloan forgeries the delaware	art center will maintain	a complete file of photographs of all sloan works as well as	a card index file.	4.73280572938926
7601. the entire sloan collection will be made available	at the center to all serious art students and historians.	3.612050476993076
7602. the	current exhibition which remains on view through oct 29 has tapped	14 major collections and many private sources.	5.062258769103611
7603. any musician playing beethoven here where beethoven was born	is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care.	3.4840667748985625
7604. in	a sense he is offering bonn what its famous son	never did- the sound of the composer's mature style.	5.213492385788695
7605. robert	riefling who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded	23rd beethoven festival penetrated deep into the spirit of the	style.	3.714445276846148
7606. his readings were careful without being fussy and they were authoritative	without being presumptuous.	5.564308671220684
7607. the 32 c minor variations	with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another	leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline.	3.084448873731681
7608. the d minor sonata op 31 no 2 introduced by dynamically	shaped arpeggios was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative-	single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way	toward the idea to come.	4.7898787881167655
7609. these inwardly dramatic moments showed the	kind of opera style of which beethoven was genuinely capable	but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging.	3.3999141778764446
7610. two late sonatas op 110 and 111 were played with similar insight	the disarming simplicities of the op 111 adagio made plain without	ever becoming obvious.	4.6092407957310115
7611. the two were separated from each other by	the six bagatelles of op 126.	3.651994712828715
7612. herr riefling in everything he	gave his large beethoven hall audience proved himself as an interpreter	of unobtrusive authority.	5.040280502665695
7613. volker wangenheim who conducted	bonn's sta^dtisches	orchester on the following evening made	one more conscious of the process of interpretation.	3.8021357047579856
7614. herr wangenheim	has only recently become the city's music director and is a young	man with a clear flair for the podium.	5.445942708036367
7615. but he weighted the eighth	symphony at times with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed	considerably at odds with the music.	3.6365014023455697
7616. he might have been hoping to all	appearances that this relatively sunny symphony in conjunction	with the choral fantasy at the end of the program could amount	to something like the ninth; but no amount of head-tossing could	make it so.	5.3588834957744815
7617. the conductor's preoccupation with the business	of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness as with the first	orchestra entrance in the fourth piano concerto but when he put	his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed	it did so with plenty of spring.	3.07461399041408
7618. the concerto's soloist	hans richter-haaser played with compensatory ease and economy though	without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on	the previous evening by herr riefling.	4.47080038018764
7619. his was a burgomaster's	beethoven solid and sensible.	4.337862008563693
7620. everybody returned after intermission	for the miscellaneous sweepings of the fantasy for piano chorus	and orchestra in c minor made up by its composer to fill	out one of his programs.	4.992375244370117
7621. the entrance of the sta^dtisches gesangverein	was worth all the waiting however as the	young rhenish voices finally brought the music to life.	3.326039141422328
7622. the	last program of this festival which during two weeks had sampled most	compositional categories brought the cologne rundfunk-sinfonie-orchester	and rundfunkchor to bonn's gold-filled hall for a performance	of the missa solemnis.	4.5407347473769315
7623. a tribe in ancient india believed the earth was a huge tea tray	resting on the backs of three giant elephants which in turn stood	on the shell of a great tortoise.	3.357361556677775
7624. this theory eventually proved inexact.	7.550638099720679
7625. but the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known	bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science.	4.123353028112421
7626. it is the business of cosmologists the scientists who	study the nature and structure of the universe to try to solve the great	cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors.	5.699395815836892
7627. these keys are the working principles of physics mathematics and astronomy	principles which are then extrapolated or projected to explain	phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge.	3.472427797002768
7628. in	the autumn of 1959 the british broadcasting corporation presented	a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology.	5.249645791255301
7629. three	of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other	acted as a moderator.	3.7908847643399852
7630. the participants were professor h bondi	professor of mathematics at king's college london; dr w	b bonnor reader in mathematics at queen elizabeth college	london; dr r a lyttleton a lecturer at st john's	college cambridge and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the	university of cambridge; and dr g j whitrow reader	in applied mathematics at the imperial college of science and technology	london.	4.050878440595907
7631. dr whitrow functioned as moderator.	5.322822977460653
7632. the	programs were so well received by the british public that the arguments	have been published in a totally engrossing little book called rival	theories of cosmology.	5.024166113069696
7633. dr bonnor begins with	a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe based on	the general theory of relativity.	3.9649795417425606
7634. first of all and this has been calculated	by observation the universe is expanding- that is the galaxies	are receding from each other at immense speeds.	6.3310599897623385
7635. because of this	dr bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated	by stars and whatever else is there.	4.01239316616202
7636. this expansion has been going	on for an estimated eight billion years.	5.782905916142282
7637. dr bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts	that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and	reverse itself and that the contraction will set in.	3.7062370295482006
7638. then after many	more billions of years when all the galaxies are whistling toward a	common center this movement will slow down and reverse itself again.	5.234733704640153
7639. professor bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction theory.	4.308560842078589
7640. he supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually	being created in space.	5.300913937979547
7641. for this reason he says the density	of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are	zooming away in all directions.	4.171365813503017
7642. new galaxies are forever being formed	to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies.	5.951289540340259
7643. if this	is true then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years	ago and as it will look millions of years hence even though the universe	is expanding.	3.973511969386226
7644. for new galaxies to be created professor bondi	declares it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be	created in an area the size of your living room once every few million	years.	5.714318451457878
7645. he contends this idea doesn't conflict with experiments on	which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because	some slight error must be assumed in such experiments.	3.294824507594768
7646. dr	lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe	and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons.	5.315120200825487
7647. protons	and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract	each other and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen-	the basic building block of matter.	3.4309027930907776
7648. the charges of the electron	and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite but dr	lyttleton is not so sure.	4.894130661110977
7649. suppose says dr lyttleton the proton	has a slightly greater charge than the electron	.	3.8434669842637086
7650. this would give the hydrogen atom a slight	charge-excess.	7.3822334741377045
7651. now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface	of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms it would be subject both to the	gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms	in the sphere.	3.6703167347161627
7652. because electrical forces are far	more powerful than gravitation the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot	away from the sphere.	5.518924143139103
7653. dr lyttleton then imagines the universe	as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from	it.	3.52982469484003
7654. this he claims would reasonably account for the expansion of the	universe.	6.650940419258052
7655. this slim book while giving the	reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the	universe has the appeal that informed conversation always has.	3.1880158083258316
7656. several	photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with	the discussion and the smooth language indicates the contributors	were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost	every field.	4.718854773118182
7657. it is clear from this discussion that cosmologists	of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made	satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up	new vistas to science.	3.3345259774959666
7658. presently the intense absorption of ultra-violet	rays in the earth's atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation.	5.225349663930571
7659. these scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the	earth's gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic	theories.	3.5847223395723136
7660. there would seem to be some small solace in	the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time	accelerating the study of the space around us giving us a long-sought	ladder from which to peer at alien regions.	5.815105610425722
7661. in doing away with	the tea tray the elephants and the giant tortoise science has developed	a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos.	3.270118114808568
7662. and although the universe may forever defy understanding it might even	now be finding its match in the imagination of man.	5.488484873804885
7663. roots the new play at the brand-new mayfair theater on 46th	st	which has been made over from a night club is about the intellectual	and spiritual awakening of an english farm girl.	3.6247184773517374
7664. highly successful	in england before its transfer to new york most of roots is	as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are	gaudy.	5.085558493437041
7665. only in its final scene where beatie bryant	shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual	lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile	the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch	for most of the first two and one-half acts.	3.5855971017108024
7666. the burden of mr	wesker's message is that people living close to the soil	are not the happy fine strong natural earthy people	city-bred intellectuals imagine.	4.848540630181788
7667. rather they are genuine clods proud	of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating	influences of aesthetics or thought.	3.3538852258374265
7668. they care no more for politics	says mr wesker than they do for a symphony.	5.787195703491939
7669. seeming to have roots	in the soil they actually have none in life.	3.736852743570045
7670. they dwell in short	in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are	commonly reported to have lived.	5.400892710356492
7671. but this is a theme which does	not take so much time to state as mr wesker dedicates to it.	4.308007224221388
7672. so	much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest	of the theatergoer	.	5.411276809966068
7673. the messy meals the washing	of dishes the drying of clothes may be realism but there is such	a thing as redundancy.	3.2699143414248706
7674. now for the good points.	10.5856486089109
7675. miss doyle	as beatie has a great fund of animal spirits a strong voice and a	warm smile.	3.6742596419468967
7676. she is just home from a sojourn in london where she has	become the sweetheart of a young fellow named ronnie	and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating	including a dose of good british socialism.	5.137487600374528
7677. but while she	is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open	before her ronnie has not been able to observe her progress and	instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull	he sends beatie a letter of dismissal.	3.3038045737708694
7678. beatie getting	no sympathy for her misfortune soon rallies and finds that although she	has lost a lover she has gained her freedom.	4.905244920092167
7679. despite a too long sustained	declamatory flight this final speech is convincing and we see	why british audiences apparently were impressed by roots.	3.3664738824558156
7680. there were several fairly good minor portraits in the play including	william hansen's impersonation of a stubborn rather pathetic	father and katherine squire's vigorous characterization of a farm	mother who brooked no hifalutin' nonsense from her daughter or anyone	else.	4.620722516078997
7681. but i am afraid mr wesker's meat and potatoes dish	isn't well seasoned enough for local audiences.	3.927808354042576
7682. shakespeare had a word for everything even for the rain	that disrupted wednesday night's much ado about nothing opening	the season of free theatre in central park.	4.987300161931493
7683. the new	york shakespeare festival which is using the wollman memorial skating	rink while its theatre near the belvedere is being completed	began bravely.	3.1639097039378057
7684. joseph papp impassioned founder of the festival and	director of much ado had a vibrant colorful production under	way.	5.048766582363326
7685. using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with	shakespeare's words in a spirited mixture.	3.687918603716437
7686. the audience	filled all the seats inside the wollman enclosure and overflowed onto	the lawns outside the fence.	4.722357663513918
7687. the barbed sallies of beatrice and benedick	so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult raised	chuckles.	3.110515483115303
7688. the simple-minded comedy of dogberry and verges also	familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of	writers' heads evoked laughter.	4.376225811602284
7689. the vivacity of the masquers'	party at leonato's palace with the spanish motif in the music and	dancing in honor of the visiting prince of arragon cast a spell of	delight.	3.087447796668104
7690. as much ado turned serious while the insipid	claudio rejected hero at the altar a sprinkle began to fall.	5.484298687851442
7691. at	first hardly a person in the audience moved although some umbrellas	were opened.	4.049481802392222
7692. but the rain came more heavily and men and women in	light summer clothes began to depart.	5.876347124577361
7693. the grieving hero and her father	leonato followed by the friar left the stage.	3.511472793230701
7694. a voice on the	loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance	would resume in ten minutes.	5.4400885081314945
7695. more than half the audience departed.	6.4317065511811675
7696. some remained in the wollman enclosure fortified with raincoats	or with newspapers to cover their heads.	5.7710325167462475
7697. others huddled under the trees	outside the fence.	4.73582080717568
7698. twenty minutes after the interruption although	it was still raining the play was resumed at the point in the fourth	act where it had been stopped.	6.303859535066934
7699. beatrice and	benedick took their places on the stage.	4.042964823111844
7700. in their	very first speeches it was clear that shakespeare like a nostradamus	had foreseen this moment.	5.388690296398386
7701. said benedick: lady beatrice	have you wept all this while?	4.18477416830918
7702.    replied beatrice:	yea and i will weep a while longer.	6.3066546888736665
7703. the heavens refused	to give up their weeping.	3.7120129599483955
7704. the gallant company completed act 4	and got through part of act 5.	4.7289062571352645
7705. but the final scenes could not	be played.	4.7520898094890125
7706. if any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour	are in doubt about how it comes out let them take comfort.	5.534459134091556
7707. the parks department has done an admirable	job of preparing the wollman rink for shakespeare.	3.209321156286774
7708. one could	hardly blame newbold morris the parks commissioner for devoting	so much grateful mention to the department's technicians who at short	notice provided the stage with its rising platforms its balcony	its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the	villains.	4.6832909771354405
7709. eldon elder who designed the stage also created	a gay spacious set that blended attractively with the park background	and shakespeare's lighthearted mood.	3.15709224195223
7710. mr papp has directed a	performance that has verve and pace although he has tolerated obvious	business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style	would be preferable.	4.603489041219257
7711. elisabeth schwarzkopf sang so magnificently saturday night at	hunter college that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints.	3.62225952370617
7712. still a demurrer or two must be entered.	7.246799093928853
7713. schwarzkopf is	of course schwarzkopf.	4.906187527587993
7714. for style and assurance for a supreme and	regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her.	6.016358395258846
7715. if the voice	is just a shade less glorious than it used to be it is still a beautiful	instrument controlled and flexible.	3.958951600548555
7716. put to the service of lieder	of schubert brahms strauss and wolf in a dramatical and musical	way it made its effect with ease and precision.	5.172030635620438
7717. but what has	been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism.	4.217298600987458
7718. instead	of her old confidence in the simplest purest most moving musical	expression miss schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic	sin of artistic pride- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads	a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the	music by bringing to it something extra some personal dramatic touch	imposed from the outside.	4.386952488645983
7719. the symptoms saturday night were	unmistakable.	3.966487999697818
7720. clever light songs were overly coy tragic songs a little	too melodramatic.	5.155769459415018
7721. there was an extra pause here a gasp or a sigh	there here and there an extra little twist of a word or note all in	the interest of effect.	3.5525363239670678
7722. the result was like that of a beautiful painting	with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness.	6.506636247238772
7723. there were stunning musical phrases too and sometimes	the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication.	3.769706341848867
7724. miss schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist john wustman often achieved	the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition.	5.096343572636498
7725. all the more	reason why there should have been no place for the frills; miss	schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them.	4.07423760535185
7726. the dance dancers and dance enthusiasts	had a much better time of it at lewisohn stadium on saturday night	than all had had two nights earlier when stadium concerts presented	the first of two dance programs.	4.836412116076695
7727. on saturday the orchestra	was sensibly situated down on the field the stage floor was apparently	in decent condition for dancing and the order of the program improved.	4.237427503962117
7728. there was additionally a bonus for the saturday-night	patrons.	7.16926356117613
7729. alvin ailey and carmen de lavallade appeared in the first	new york performance of mr ailey's roots of the blues	a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the boston arts festival.	3.356023324120634
7730. otherwise the program included as on thursday the	taras-tchaikovsky design for strings the dollar-britten	divertimento the dollar-de banfield the duel and	the pas de deux from the nutcracker.	4.943321685397273
7731. maria tallchief	and erik bruhn who danced the nutcracker pas de deux were	also seen in the petipa-minkus pas de deux from don quixote	another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely.	3.1130948206967153
7732. among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening	elisabeth carroll and ivan allen were particularly impressive in	their roles in the duel a work that depends so much upon the	precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants.	4.930927140777186
7733. mr	ailey's roots of the blues an earthy and very human modern	dance work provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of	the evening.	3.4747106940824293
7734. as brother john sellers sang five blues	to the guitar and drum accompaniments of bruce langhorne and shep	shepard mr ailey and miss de lavallade went through volatile	dances that were by turns insinuating threatening contemptuous and	ecstatic.	4.343106978934042
7735. their props were two stepladders a chair and a palm	fan.	4.164806933526676
7736. he wore the clothes of a laborer and she was wondrously seductive	in a yellow and orange dress.	5.246646342948891
7737. the cat-like sinuousness	and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps lifts crawls and	slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong sometimes	almost frightening tensions.	2.9734459693297275
7738. roots of the blues may	not be for gentle souls but others should welcome its super-charged impact.	5.419833714199887
7739. perhaps it is better to stay at home.	5.718368800941574
7740. the armchair traveler	preserves his illusions.	5.545521404107932
7741. this somewhat cynical comment may	be found in blue skies brown studies a collection of travel	essays by william sansom who would never consider staying home for	long.	3.3688002785583304
7742. mr sansom is english bearded formidably cultivated the	versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories of novels and	of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something	midway between.	4.683531538512629
7743. the only man alive who seems qualified by	his learning his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance	of language to inherit the literary mantle of sacheverell sitwell	mr sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration	worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of	a hungarian beauty and an american multimillionaire	.	2.9919908343478148
7744. the result is rather wonderful but so rich as to be indigestible	if taken in too thick slices.	5.686763127171458
7745. there are sixteen essays	in blue skies brown studies.	4.592970067723853
7746. most of them were written between	1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines.	6.732295812553663
7747. all	are well written and are overwritten.	4.5135572286171
7748. but even if mr sansom labors	too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from	his travel experiences than the limits of language allow he still can	charm and astound.	4.9685514801715875
7749. too many books and articles are just assembled by	putting one word after another.	3.920554470406502
7750. mr sansom actually writes his	with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence with an intense	relish in all the metaphorical resources of english with a thick shower	of sophisticated cultural references.	4.931654209658892
7751. i like to sniff a place and reproduce what it really smells	and looks like its color its particular kind of life.	3.6899068843901266
7752. this is	an exact description of what mr sansom does.	6.230673970738046
7753. he only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches	an individual or quotes his opinions.	3.3880672182691867
7754. it is an over-all impression	mr sansom strives for an impression compounded of visual details	of a savory mixture of smells of much loving attention to architecture	and scenery of lights and shadows of intangibles of atmosphere	and of echoes of the past.	4.477039433700677
7755. william sansom writes only about	europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as london	vienna the french riviera and the norwegian fjords.	3.6025395577195347
7756. but no	matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original	mind and his own sensitive reactions.	5.329861166991212
7757. a writer lives at best in	a state of astonishment he says.	3.785373911815137
7758. beneath any feeling he has of	the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it	all.	5.930171422459927
7759. to transmit that feeling he writes.	4.842798705243948
7760. this may not be true of	many writers but it certainly is true of mr sansom.	7.215136466266525
7761. so in these	pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of st torpetius	that still persists in st tropez; at the sun and the	heat of mediterranean lands always much brighter and hotter to an englishman	than to an american used to summers in new york or kansas	city; at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world's	finest restaurants la bonne auberge which is situated on the seacoast	twenty miles west of the nice airport; and at the infinite variety	of london.	3.291433173863985
7762. mr sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular	way which recalls the statues of bernini	and the gigantic paintings of tintoretto.	5.158151096113848
7763. he can coin a neat phrase:	a street spattered with an invigoration of people; tulips	with petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel's ears; after a	snowstorm a landscape smelling of woodsmoke and clarity.	2.960352835609213
7764. and for	all his lacquered almost byzantine self-consciousness he can make	one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison.	4.955855545354826
7765. from afar	in one of his best essays mr sansom expresses	his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by andrea palladio	himself that dot the environs of vicenza.	3.657142538624817
7766. how far that pedimented	and pillared style has shed its influence mr sansom reminds	us thus:   the white colonnaded cedar-roofed southern mansion	is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied england	to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue south	the palladian orbit stretching out from vicenza: the old mind of	andrea palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair	on a southern porch the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise	firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen his feeling for light	and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep his sense of columns	framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple	of mating lips.	4.223476386420566
7767. nice even if a trifle gaudy.	4.861549141526951
7768. blue skies	brown studies is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs.	5.8674325845806035
7769. in recent days there have been extensive lamentations over	the absence of original drama on television but not for years have	many regretted the passing of new plays on radio.	3.432298909676823
7770. wbai the listener-supported	outlet on the frequency-modulation band has decided	to do what it can to correct this aural void.	5.306670148553963
7771. yesterday it offered	poised for violence by jean reavey.	4.143400552310782
7772. wbai is on	the right track: in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis	on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre	as the canadian and british broadcasting corporations continue	to demonstrate.	5.126287818473935
7773. unfortunately poised for violence was not	the happiest vehicle with which to make the point.	4.539251315182343
7774. mrs	reavey's work is written for the stage- it is mentioned for an off-broadway	production in the fall- and in addition employs an avant-garde	structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension	is to be encouraged.	5.092371289255514
7775. the play's device is to explore society's	obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group	of artist's models who remain part of someone else's painting	rather than just be themselves.	3.1073341306216453
7776. in a succession of scenes they appear	in different guises- patrons of a cafe performers in a circus and	participants in a family picnic- but in each instance they inevitably	put ugliness before beauty.	4.771708360715046
7777. somewhere in mrs reavey's	play there is both protest and aspiration of merit.	3.82093002463884
7778. but its relentless	discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that	after an hour and a half a listener's stamina begins to wilt.	5.457778948856147
7779. moreover	her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous	assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own	right or as a provocative symbol of mankind's ills.	3.10231930862889
7780. but quite	conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the	work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve	the burden on the author's words.	4.8755150842773896
7781. which in itself is an immediate	reward of the wbai experiment; good radio drama has its own	special demands that badly need reinvigoration.	3.449419069620788
7782. a weekly showcase for contemporary music from the austere	archaism of stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music	is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month.	4.509102423821671

7786. the show is programed and	written by the station's assistant continuity editor chuck briefer.	4.78188235693966
7787. the first saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings.	4.209566874645058
7788. last saturday's interesting melange included ernst toch	karlheinz stockhausen richard yardumian and a brief excerpt from	a new space opera by the swedish composer karl-birger blomdahl.	4.740960056000805
7789. other saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected american	composer a particular type of music or the music of a given	country.	3.721662528822116
7790. it is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is	set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene.	5.456726375518913
7791. but	one wishes when the appetite is whetted as it was in the case of	the all-too-brief excerpt from the blomdahl opera that further opportunity	would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety	and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions.	3.659009699133862
7792. the moiseyev dance company dropped in at madison square	garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before	it brings its long american tour to a close.	5.233163055125444
7793. it is not simply	giving a repetition of the program it gave during its new york	engagement earlier this season but has brought back many of the numbers	that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody's	heart.	3.780162533946033
7794. it is good to see those numbers again.	7.078146521530279
7795. the suite	of old russian dances that opened that inaugural program	with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into	typical moiseyev vigor and warmth; the amusing yurochka	in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance; the	lovely polyanka or the meadow;	the three moldavian dances entitled zhok; the sweet and funny	little dance about potato planting called bul'ba; and	the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called city	quadrille are all just as good as one remembers them to have been	and they are welcome back.	2.797033594438318
7796. so for that matter are the newer	dances- the kalmuk dance with its animal movements that genial	juggling act by sergei tsvetkov called the platter the	rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called summer the	three shepherds of azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs	and of course the trenchant rock 'n' roll.	4.514379657397913
7797. as autumn starts its annual sweep few americans and canadians realize	how fortunate they are in having the world's finest fall coloring.	3.543136131595611

7890. if this was in fact mr remarque's	intention he has achieved a notable failure.	6.994056263624455

7900. between the first meeting	of clerfayt and lillian and this dismal denouement mr remarque	has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse some demure	and rather fetching love-making pleasant talk about some of the	countryside and restaurants of europe and a modicum of automobile racing.	4.424578704161195
7901. the ramblings on life death and the wonder of it all are distressing;	the love-making perhaps because it is pale and low-key when	one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness is	often charming; the automobile racing bears little relation to reality.	3.023062900512174
7902. this latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and	it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author	drawn clerfayt as say a tournament golfer.	5.672140010231479
7903. hazards to life and	limb on the golf course while existent are actuarially insignificant.	3.6325913530359757
7904. race-drivers on the other hand are quite often killed on the circuit	and since it was obviously mr remarque's intention to establish	automobile racing as life in microcosm one might reasonably have	expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques	but of mores and attitudes.	4.759538667882357
7905. the jacket biography describes	him as a former racing driver and he may indeed have been although	i do not recall having encountered his name either in the records	or the literature.	3.1282732929823758
7906. perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal.	7.680194863726113
7907. the	book carries a disclaimer in which remarque says it has been necessary	for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities	of racing.	3.8134553753890925
7908. the necessity is not clear to me and in any case	to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car	which or whom he calls giuseppe parked on the place vendome	sneering at a dozen bentleys and rolls-royces parked around	him is not a liberty; it is an absurdity.	4.845272266258688
7909. but it is in the	matter of preoccupation with death which is the primary concern of	the book that remarque's failure is plainest.	4.316995093927456
7910. clerfayt is neurotic	preoccupied and passive.	7.349511647550678
7911. to be human he believes is to seek one's	own destruction: the freudian death-wish cliche inevitably	cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers.	3.409323325048803
7912. in point of fact	the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent healthy	technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the	passion they feel for the work by which they live.	5.362337122862534
7913. a clerfayt may moon	on about the face of death in the cockpit; a portago could say	as he did say to me if i die tomorrow still i have had twenty-eight	wonderful years; but i shan't die tomorrow; i'll live	to be 105.	3.30053486741782
7914. clerfayt transported may think of the engine	driving his car as a mystical beast under the hood.	5.670830404438239
7915. the italian	master piero taruffi no less sensitive knows twice the ecstasy	though he thinks of a car's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles	an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae.	2.9465327850932455
7916. clerfayt	driving	sees himself a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell;	the briton stirling moss one of the greatest virtuosi of all	time believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related	to ballet.	4.8208654387498475
7917. errors in technical terminology suggest that	the over-all translation from the german may not convey quite everything	mr remarque hoped to tell us.	3.224202730898606
7918. however my principal	objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers	pilots submariners atomic researchers and all the machine-masters	of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists.	5.168045377093593
7919. is leaderless according to this book.	5.788814321443705
7920. in	contrast	the east is ably led by such stalwart heroes as khrushchev tito	and mao.	5.135624786268934
7921. against this invincible determination to communize the	whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals	and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common	good of all.	3.4981839383250475
7922. it is field marshal montgomery's belief that	in most western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really	care about democracy or christianity; about 30 per cent call themselves	christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered	respectable and only the last 10 per cent are genuine christians and	believers in democracy.	5.607453410064848
7923. but these western countries do care	about themselves.	4.868632583001836
7924. if say the russians	intended to stop tom jones' going to the pub then tom jones	would fight the commies.	5.216741917415382
7925. but he would fight for his own liberty rather	than for any abstract principle connected with it- such as cause.	3.8105301406103425
7926. for all practical purposes the west stands disunited undedicated	and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership.	5.674868615766864
7927. with	this barrage montgomery of alamein launches his attack upon the	blunderings of the west.	3.578940509783006
7928. never given to mincing words he places heavy	blame upon the faulty uncourageous leadership of britain and particularly	america.	5.287842931659458
7929. at war's end leadership in western europe passed	from britain because the labour government devoted its attention	to the creation of a welfare state.	3.72191459660142
7930. with britain looking inward overseas	problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the united	states.	5.876926243508783
7931. montgomery believes that she started well.	5.296486374209174
7932. america	gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend	and foe alike.	5.779073197842948
7933. she pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into	prosperity but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace.	3.5939176398094332
7934. america has divided more than she has united the west.	6.8440714390117385
7935. the reasons	are that america generally believes that she can buy anything with	dollars and that she compulsively strives to be liked.	3.307052032160589
7936. however she	really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by	a quality of leadership that is basically needed.	6.050655094412011
7937. but the greater	reason for fumbling stumbling american leadership is due to the	shock her pride suffered when the japanese attacked at pearl harbor.	3.3979271808544182
7938. they are determined montgomery writes not to be surprised	again and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not	only unnecessary but also creates nervousness h among other nations	in the western alliance- not to mention such great suspicions among	the nations of the eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful	coexistence or disarmament is not possible.	5.014645645447968
7939. the net result	is that under american leadership the general world situation has	become bad.	3.362594449565532
7940. to monty the american people who in two previous	world wars were very reluctant to join the fight now look like the	nation most likely to lead us all into a third world war.	5.591048314109542
7941. faulty as has been our leadership clearly the united states	must be relied upon to lead.	3.671901009259698
7942. the path to leadership is made clear.	5.874108240516773
7943. montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the west's own	house in order.	4.027459723519413
7944. such a man must be able and willing to give clear and	sensible advice to the whole group a person in whom all the member nations	will have absolute confidence.	6.168738733438438
7945. this leader must be a man who lives	above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of	the united states namely that russia will agree to a reunited germany	that the east german government does not exist that events in	japan in june 1960 were communist-inspired that the true government	of china is in formosa that mao was the evil influence behind	khrushchev at the summit conference in paris in may 1960 and that	either china or russia wants or expects war.	3.1357779729931012
7946. such a leader	must strengthen nato politically and establish that true unity	about which it has always talked.	5.91340843652654
7947. after drastically overhauling nato	western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that	tear apart the east and west.	3.679239065806328
7948. major to this effort is to get all	world powers to withdraw to their own territories say by 1970.	5.782106754213843
7949. the	west should make the central proposal; but the east would have	to show sincerity in carrying it out.	3.474409648622254
7950. but where is the	leader who will handle all these things for us?	6.170592597828272
7951.  montgomery knew	all the national leaders up to the time of kennedy.	5.560494144114578
7952. the man whom he	would select as our leader for this great task is de gaulle.	5.414932121616412
7953. he alone	has the wisdom the conviction the tenacity and the courage to reach	a decision.	3.708109948229657
7954. but de gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring france's	lost soul.	6.293475285319034
7955. whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous	path to leadership.	3.913779850467707
7956. the leader montgomery envisages will need	to discipline himself lead a carefully regulated and orderly life	allow time for quiet thought and reflection adapt decisions and plans	to changing situations be ruthless particularly with inefficiency	and be honest and morally proper.	4.136370267810006
7957. all in all montgomery calls for a	leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him.	3.9668390718438533
7958. as far back as moses thence to cromwell	napoleon lincoln churchill and nehru montgomery attempts	to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men.	5.050968732712224
7959. he believes that	greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented	by churchill who would very possibly have gone down in history	as a political failure if it had not been for hitler's war.	3.4760583529777755
7960. however montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory	and practice.	6.4952430014445115
7961. most of what is said about his great men of history	has already been said and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary	scene.	4.352647383876878
7962. like eisenhower he holds the militarist's suspicion	of politicians.	6.78232327619433
7963. however at the same time montgomery selects as	his hero de gaulle who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions.	4.183455540734057
7964. monty shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement	and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support.	5.059776628655234
7965. for the most part his writing rambles and jogs preventing easy access	by the reader to his true thoughts.	3.9128644362287
7966. nevertheless montgomery	has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the western world.	6.532231825217719
7967. it suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership.	4.292577332044794
7968. and it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form	can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the	current shape of events.	6.121426903173538
7969. no common thing for a listener	to hear a singer live for the first time only after he	has died.	4.271583671693006
7970. but then mario lanza was no common singer and his whole	career public and non-public was studded with the kind of unconventional	happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first recital	only when he has ceased to be a living voice.	5.457695311901498
7971. it is a kind	of justice too that it should originate in london's royal albert	hall where traditionally the loudest if not the greatest performers	have entertained the thousands it will accommodate	.	3.472926244698377
7972. to be sure lanza made numerous concert	tours here and abroad but these did not take him to new york	where the carping critic might lurk.	5.750709043639798
7973. the reading public the theatergoing public the skindiving	public the	horse-playing public- all these and others fill substantial roles	in us life but none is so varied vast and vigilant as the eating	public.	2.9378658981245254
7974. the department of agriculture averaged out us	food consumption last year at 1488 lbs per person which allowing	for the 17 million americans that john kennedy said go to bed hungry	every night means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow	down 8 lbs or more a day.	4.522146213151853
7975. that mother hen of the weight-height	tables the metropolitan life insurance co clucks that 48 million	americans are overweight.	3.5144914472254034
7976. through previous centuries eating	changed by nearly imperceptible degrees and mostly toward just	getting enough.	5.278961165433249
7977. now big forces buffet food.	5.3867180898130185
7978. for the first time in history	the us has produced a society in which less than one-tenth	of the people turn out so much food that the government's most	embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million	tons of surplus farm produce.	5.091411694892661
7979. in this same society the plain citizen	can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than	he can consume.	3.7588197061806974
7980. refrigeration automated processing and packaging	conspire to defy season and banish spoilage.	5.257480443000219
7981. and in the wake of the new	affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new american	interest in how what people eat affects their health.	3.799558546131246
7982. to eat is human	the nation is learning to think to survive divine.	5.917043433901835
7983. not all the concern for health is well directed.	5.0931051285227085
7984. from the fusty	panaceas of spinach eggs and prunes the us has progressed	to curds concentrates and capsules.	5.4980649106037776
7985. each year reports the american	medical association ten million americans spend $900 million on	vitamins tonics and other food supplements.	3.6517888869036264
7986. at juice bars in los	angeles' 35 health stores a new sensation is a pink high-protein	cocktail concocted of dried eggs powdered milk and cherry-flavored	no-cal which sells for 59 per 8-oz glass.	4.4977643324055725
7987. grocery stores	sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all.	3.4306370699001656
7988. but a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet	and health and a big group of us scientists wants to supply	them.	6.0113635289249485
7989. the man most firmly at grips with the problem is the university	of minnesota's physiologist ancel keys 57 inventor of the wartime	k ration and author of last year's bestselling	eat well and stay well.	3.4156612521464096
7990. from his birch-paneled office in the	laboratory of physiological hygiene under the university's football	stadium in minneapolis	blocky grey-haired dr keys directs an ambitious $200000-a-year	experiment on diet which spans three continents and seven nations	and is still growing.	4.455421188184226
7991. pursuing it he has logged 500000 miles suffered	indescribable digestive indignities and meticulously collected	physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10000 individuals	from bantu tribesmen to italian contadini.	3.0317883432371433
7992. he has measured	the skinfolds of neapolitan	firemen studied the metabolism of finnish woodcutters analyzed	the mealie-meal eaten by capetown coloreds and experimented	on minneapolis businessmen.	4.555905198860791
7993. keys's findings	though far from complete are likely to smash many an eating cliche.	3.747509982830389
7994. vitamins eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on	.	5.785242527198326
7995. readings of the number of milligrams	of cholesterol in the blood which seem to have value in predicting	heart attacks are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram	which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack.	3.6201696578499702
7996. already	many an american knows his count and rejoices or worries depending	on whether it is nearer 180.	5.220660795089224
7997. out	of cholesterol come keys's main messages so far:    americans	eat too much.	3.4544160382417366
7998. the typical us daily menu says dr	keys contains 3000 calories should contain 2300.	4.662854693282255
7999. and extra weight	increases the risk of cancer diabetes artery disease and heart attack.	4.077876610020207
8000. americans eat too much fat.	7.928555009817235
8001. with meat milk butter	and ice cream the calorie-heavy us diet is 40% fat and most	of that is saturated fat- the insidious kind says dr keys	that increases blood cholesterol damages arteries and leads to coronary	disease.	2.9592853993748176
8002. throughout much of the	world food is still so scarce that half of the earth's population	has trouble getting the 1600 calories a day necessary to sustain life.	5.429765491080378
8003. the deficiency diseases- scurvy tropical sprue pellagra- run	rampant.	3.2046322174653685
8004. in west africa for example where meat is a luxury and babies	must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals	a childhood menace is kwashiorkor or red johnny a growth-stunting	protein deficiency	that kills more than half its victims leaves the rest prey for parasites	and lingering tropical disease.	4.508205629525086
8005. in the well-fed us	deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years.	4.099601838299778
8006. today	as harrison's principles of internal medicine a standard	internist's text puts it the most common form of malnutrition	is caloric excess or obesity.	5.060645592671783
8007. puritan new england regarded	obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance and thus a sin.	3.6786357982465683
8008. says	keys: maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral	the fat man would start to think.	5.140065921817688
8009. morals aside the fat man	has plenty to worry about- over and above the fact that no one any	longer loves him.	3.9614360810500053
8010. the simple mechanical strain of overweight says new	york's dr norman jolliffe can overburden and damage the	heart for much the same reason that a chevrolet engine in a cadillac	body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it	was built.	4.603570423205933
8011. the fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to	pay higher premiums.	3.337356059845455
8012. he has- for unclear reasons- a 25% higher	death rate from cancer.	5.243960790380188
8013. he is particularly vulnerable to diabetes.	5.467069232421515
8014. he	may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable because excess	body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement.	4.654760124536513
8015. physiologically people overeat because what dr jolliffe	calls the appestat is set too high.	3.48725454103073
8016. the appestat which adjusts	the appetite to keep weight constant is located says jolliffe	in the hypothalamus- near the body's temperature sleep and water-balance	controls.	4.3786443145291996
8017. physical exercise raises the appestat.	4.881691880739913
8018. in moderate doses alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances	appetite; but because liquor	has a high caloric value- 100 calories per oz- the heavy	drinker is seldom hungry.	4.502752631008776
8019. in rare cases diseases such as encephalitis	or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently destroying	nearly all sense of satiety.	3.2786515686352167
8020. far more frequently	overeating	is the result of a psychological compulsion.	7.82330732356032
8021. it	may be fostered by frustration depression insecurity- or in children	simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging.	3.432835083517633
8022. some	families place undue emphasis on food: conversations center on it	and rich delicacies are offered as rewards withheld as punishment.	4.645425985972415
8023. the	result says jolliffe: the child gains the feeling that food	is the purpose of life.	3.9380235456963844
8024. food may act as a sedative giving temporary	emotional solace just as for some people alcohol does.	5.402592983579119
8025. reports	dr keys: a fairly common experience for us is the wife who	finds her husband staying out more and more.	3.5082415988307023
8026. he may be interested in	another woman or just like being with the boys.	6.214958637764767
8027. so she fishes around	in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake.	3.7982324214279735
8028. it's a matter of	boredom and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something	because she's being deprived of something else.	5.390023453989813
8029. for the	army of compulsive eaters- from the nibblers and the gobblers to	the downright gluttons- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely	won.	3.3818731396880466
8030. physiologist keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants	as the amphetamines	as dangerous crutches	for a weak will.	4.732588091813399
8031. keys has no such objections to metrecal	quaker oats's quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are	currently winning favor from dieters.	3.244382210685716
8032. metrecal is a pretty complete	food he says.	6.606030529691286
8033. it contains large amounts of protein vitamins	and minerals.	4.639915965718454
8034. in the quantity of 900 calories a day anyone will lose	weight on it- 20 30 or 40 lbs.	5.376257980606294
8035. but keys worries that the	metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological	adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food.	3.4389311671084664
8036. despite his personal distaste for obesity	dr keys has only an incidental interest	in how much americans eat.	5.514348161254263
8037. what concerns him much more is the relationship	of diet to the nation's no 1 killer: coronary artery disease	which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills	500000 americans a year- twice the toll from all varieties of	cancer five times the deaths from automobile accidents.	3.2504531444660367
8038. cholesterol	the cornerstone of dr keys's theory is a mysterious	yellowish	waxy substance chemically a crystalline alcohol.	4.94241778315392
8039. scientists	assume that cholesterol	is somehow necessary for the formation of	brain cells since it accounts for about 2% of the brain's total	solid weight.	3.23401176546393
8040. they know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones.	8.390385426602002
8041. they	suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones and	they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the	circulatory system.	3.8811208079574233
8042. but they cannot fully explain the process of its	manufacture by the human liver.	6.951098547656428
8043. although the fatty protein molecules	carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol are water soluble	cholesterol itself is insoluble and cannot be destroyed by the	body.	3.6869134288995875
8044. a remarkable substance says dr keys quite apart	from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries.	5.456085806768659
8045. when thus deposited keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible	for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks.	3.3940503204285455
8046. explains	keys: as the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream	they are deposited in the intima or inner wall of a coronary artery.	4.920161321330167
8047. the proteins and fats are burned off and the cholesterol is left	behind.	3.550359342102879
8048. as cholesterol piles up it narrows irritates and damages the	artery encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation.	4.898163870519535
8049. eventually says keys one of two things happens.	4.752090131867376
8050. a clot forms	at the site seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes	a heart attack.	5.665133621318614
8051. or the deposits themselves	get so big that they choke off the artery's flow to the point that	an infarct occurs: the heart muscle is suffocated cells supplied	by the artery die and the heart is permanently perhaps fatally injured.	3.4040053328023196
8052. ordinarily the human liver synthesizes	only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body's needs- for transportation	of fats and for production of bile.	5.112018402070625
8053. even eggs and other cholesterol-rich	foods eaten in normal amounts says dr keys do not materially	affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood.	3.901242099542557
8054. during world war 2 doctors in the netherlands	and scandinavia noted a curious fact: despite the stresses of nazi	occupation the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping.	5.24498682134911
8055. not until long after the war- 1950 in fact- did they get	a hint of the reason.	4.099461080586311
8056. that year sweden's haqvin malmros showed	that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe	restrictions on fatty foods.	4.932042066357232
8057. that same year the university of california's	dr laurance kinsell timing oxidation rates of blood	fats stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood	cholesterol levels to drop radically while animal fats cause them to	rise.	3.3231705940501444
8058. here keys and others such as dr a e ahrens of	the rockefeller institute took over to demonstrate the chemical difference	between vegetable and animal fats- and even between different	varieties of each.	4.869792578312855
8059. all natural food fats fall into one of three	categories- saturated mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated.	3.8329825742530814
8060. the	degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the	fat molecule.	6.300342333484217
8061. saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens.	4.229140685879946
8062. mono-unsaturated	fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule	and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens.	5.054602229330385
8063. the three fats have similar caloric values	but each exerts a radically different influence on	blood cholesterol.	3.1757470886898522
8064. as a result although we still make use of this distinction there is	much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed.	6.955715578225636
8065. just what	is meant by spirit and by matter?	4.81776425569247
8066.  the terms are generally	taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic	elements in the common experience of all.	4.991758549897029
8067. yet in the contemporary	context this is precisely what one must not do.	4.660749707870996
8068. for in the modern world	neither spirit nor matter refer to any generally agreed-upon	elements of experience.	5.699336069140422
8069. we are in a transitional stage in which	many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected.	4.283745616587357
8070. when the words are used we are never sure which of the traditional	meanings the user may have in mind or to what extent his revisions	and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours.	5.192197864679186
8071. one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the	almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit.	4.058691503874259
8072. just a few centuries	ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of	material entities.	6.56869344617244
8073. not only in popular thought but in that of the highly	educated as well was this true.	4.887302467430757
8074. demons fairies angels and a host	of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential	world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars.	5.335991415179015
8075. in such a world	the words matter and spirit both referred to directly	known realities in the common experience of all.	3.7843989447810173
8076. in it important elements	of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general	which now cause us much difficulty could be responded to quite naturally	and spontaneously.	5.0700643433801265
8077. the progress of science over these last	few centuries and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific	categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world	of the entities which previously populated it.	3.1844226465210923
8078. in carrying out this	program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service	for which it can claim due credit.	5.272765787038935
8079. the objectification of the world	of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the	experience of spirit could justify or support.	3.0970800669374334
8080. science is fully competent	to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object	in space and time.	5.419144733392254
8081. when therefore it turned its attention to the	concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world	of spirit these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed	as actual elements of external reality.	3.1981879207794845
8082. in doing so science has unquestionably	cleared up widespread misconceptions removed extraneous	and illusory sources of fear and dispelled many undesirable popular	superstitions.	5.131267022188223
8083. there have been indeed many important and valuable gains	from the development of our present scientific view of the world	for which we may be rightly grateful.	4.0749052353457484
8084. all this has not however	been an unmixed blessing.	7.615299360131377
8085. the scientific debunking of the spirit world	has been in a way too successful and too thorough.	3.765437638281921
8086. the house has	been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means	or at best with wholly inadequate means for dealing with his experience	of spirit.	4.807813103881548
8087. although the particular form of conceptualization which	popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit	was undoubtedly defective the raw experience itself which led to such	excesses remains with us as vividly as ever.	3.5121073225047716
8088. we simply find ourselves	in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure	and meaning of this range of our experience.	5.693647298984658
8089. there is no framework	or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and	no part	of reality as we know and apprehend it with respect to which we	can refer this experience.	3.838145541534729
8090. science has simply left us helpless and powerless	in this important sector of our lives.	5.52937907204237
8091. the situation in	which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in arthur	miller's play the crucible which deals with the salem witch	trials.	3.281031744993449
8092. as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community	of salem in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century.	6.291228717434513
8093. aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides	the immediate problem in the opening scene it is a quite normal community.	3.897522925006052
8094. the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting	the usual mixture of pleasures foibles irritations and concerns	which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any	age.	4.534522686367331
8095. there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people.	4.213587243501296
8096. instead the audience can sit back at ease and from the perspective	of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things	enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take	the witches and devils which are under discussion.	5.347074729608009
8097. a teenage girl abigail	williams is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle	the reverend samuel parris about a wild night affair in the woods	in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with	these evil beings.	3.1626102811278565
8098. for all involved in this discussion the devil is	a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night	the demon world is populated with real creatures and witches actually	can be seen flying through the air.	4.908760229269284
8099. as the play unfolds however	the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil	which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community.	3.458558694345223
8100. everyone in salem saint and sinner alike is swept up by it.	5.7055461894075625
8101. it is like a mysterious epidemic which starting first with abigail	and parris spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through	the whole town until all have been infected by it.	3.1866161022267283
8102. it grows terribly	and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery	moral disintegration and destruction.	5.17778989934542
8103. the audience leaves the play	under a spell it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit	in its living active manifestation always evokes.	3.656822205890266
8104. if one asks	about this play what it is that comes upon this community and works	within it with such terrible power there is no better answer to give	than spirit.	5.992197296647688
8105. this is not to attempt to say what spirit is but	only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a	common experience.	3.907684397570691
8106. in the end the good man john proctor expresses	what the audience has already come to feel when he says a fire	a fire is burning! i hear the boot of lucifer i see his filthy	face! the tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and	concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with	formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from	detecting the real devil when he came among them.	4.935916747270088
8107. we marvel at their	blindness for not seeing this.	4.433159633234214
8108. yet are not we of the mid-twentieth	century who rightly do not believe there is any such thing as the	devil just as bad off as they- only in a different way?	5.474214256240992
8109.  in our	disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are	unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in	this play.	3.5795075286766447
8110. we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare	speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment	to that which has already been discredited and proved false.	5.808095923248654
8111. even mr miller himself seems uncertain on this score.	4.495481960829373
8112. in	a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the	first act of the play he says at one point: however that experience	never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld	or the existence of lucifer's many-faced lieutenants.	5.362674790324889
8113. and his	belief is not to his discredit.	5.639969182947787
8114. better minds than hale's were-	and still are- convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond	our ken.	6.009455350537879
8115. on the other hand a little later on he says:	since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out god's	beard and the devil's horns but the world is still gripped between	two diametrically opposed absolutes.	3.4090694566970927
8116. the concept of unity in which	positive and negative are attributes of the same force in which good	and evil are relative ever-changing and always joined to the same phenomenon-	such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences	and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas h.	5.082881360191762
8117. when we see	the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man's	worthlessness- until redeemed- the necessity of the devil may	become evident as a weapon a weapon designed and used time and time	again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church	or church-state.	3.3041310722680484
8118. apparently he does not intend	that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being	actually real.	6.111890859553436
8119. yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that	the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and	potency of that which came over salem.	3.752753307116163
8120. it casts a spell upon them	so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence	of an evil power.	6.077868434518593
8121. it is not enough in accounting for this feeling	to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together	to produce a cumulative effect.	3.703797191627306
8122. for this does not account for the	integral elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as	the play unfolds nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness	which comes over those who watch the play like a spell.	5.09326783833143
8123. the	reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's convictions	to the contrary.	3.8772207567302486
8124. there is	nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and	universally felt than spirit.	6.465496122734785
8125. apart from spirit there could be no community	for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any	community its unity cohesiveness and permanence.	3.4907828884010854
8126. think for example	of the spirit of the marine corps.	7.638319602626535
8127. surely this is a reality we	all acknowledge.	5.273898564803523
8128. we cannot of course assign it any substance.	7.078715637386498
8129. it	is not material and is not a thing occupying space and time.	5.338973144645125
8130. yet	it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and	known.	6.139156825307791
8131. so it is too with many other spirits which we all know: the	spirit of nazism or communism school spirit the spirit of a street	corner gang or a football team the spirit of rotary or the ku klux	klan.	3.6591659920214927
8132. every community if it is alive has a spirit and that spirit	is the center of its unity and identity.	6.971121666148385
8133. in searching for clues	which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit	the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove	the most fruitful.	3.6111671533652485
8134. for it is primarily in community that we know and	experience spirit.	7.723254655544977
8135. it is spirit which gives life to a community and	causes it to cohere.	4.160000920746278
8136. it is the spirit which is the source of a community's	drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from	the world outside so that the community grows and prospers.	6.336736261155334
8137. yet the	spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community.	4.171518901129576
8138. the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable	ideas.	6.830086617407346
8139. one characteristic of the spirit in community is	its givenness.	5.276997553935811
8140. the members of the community do not create the spirit	but rather find it present and waiting for them.	5.5873368431050325
8141. it is for them a given	which they and they alone possess.	4.5653734349601445
8142. the spirit of the marine corps	was present and operative before any of the present members of it came	into it.	6.159259294846341
8143. it is they of course who keep it alive and preserve it	so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future	recruits to find as they come into it.	3.7262090465327122
8144. if the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be	understanded of the people- and this it must not be forgotten	is one of the goals of the perennial theological task- there is	no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of	representation.	5.440670037774204
8145. this does not mean that mythological language as	such can no longer be used in theology and preaching.	4.430218249761361
8146. the absurd notion	that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological	concepts completely misrepresents bultmann's intention.	4.444901814860283
8147. his point	is not that mythology may not be used but that it may no longer be regarded	as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing	the christian kerygma.	4.008086670794351
8148. when we say that a mythological mode	of thought must be completely abandoned we mean it must be abandoned	as the sole or proper means for presenting the christian understanding	of existence.	5.324415676716503
8149. mythological concepts may by all means still be used	but they can be used responsibly only as symbols or ciphers	that is only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological	terms.	3.8156289606825196
8150. the statement is often made	that when bultmann argues in this way he overestimates the intellectual	stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting	the christian faith.	5.5418134257204175
8151. but this statement is completely unconvincing.	5.685515597609642
8152. if bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered	to	the evidence is overwhelming that he does	not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of	traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant.	4.973761594277201
8153. nor is	it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our	culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly	estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been	communicated.	3.590078423469552
8154. on the contrary even in the heart of the bible	belt itself as can be attested by any one who is called to work there	the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under	way together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself	and his world.	5.512215265599876
8155. in fact it is in just such a situation	that the profundity of bultmann's argument is disclosed.	4.424340796255227
8156. although	the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do	not in a more secularized situation the striking thing is the rapidity	with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence.	5.982873879007442
8157. this is	especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle	class.	4.0945734528264754
8158. time and again in counseling and teaching one encounters	members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity	the insubstantial mythologies of their fundamentalist heritage	and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious.	5.195944053947143
8159. the same thing is also evidenced by the extreme culture-protestantism	so often observed to characterize the preaching	and teaching of the american churches.	3.767015698451363
8160. in the absence of a truly adequate	conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed the unavoidable	need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at	hand- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of	folk religion current in the situation.	5.270252279275783
8161. this is not to say that	the only explanation of the present infatuation with norman vincent	peale's cult of reassurance or the other types of a purely	cultural christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized	gospel.	4.00998253980724
8162. but it is to say that this need is far more important for such	infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected.	8.016168232903006
8163. however even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly	as widespread as we are claiming at least among the cultured elements	of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference	to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace.	3.6690467874119426
8164. to be	sure when this is pointed out a common response among certain churchmen	is to fulminate about the little flock and the great crowd	and to take solace from paul's castigation of the wisdom of	the wise in the opening chapter of first corinthians.	4.933464846399291
8165. but can	we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation?	4.232634349966429
8166.  can the church	risk assuming that the folly of men is as dear to god as their	wisdom or as is also commonly implied that the foolishness	of god and the foolishness of men are simply two ways	of talking about the same thing?	5.177207551719618
8167.  can we continue to alienate precisely	those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation	our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious?	3.625354456773906
8168. 	there is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church	derives however from the heritage of the greeks rather than from	that god is completely independent of his creation and	so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world.	4.941234304076872
8169. by analogy	the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the	world in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be	the church.	4.003702721296239
8170. but as scripture everywhere reminds us god does	have need of his creatures and the church a fortiori can ill afford	to do without the talents with which the world by god's providence	presents it.	5.286508357864882
8171. and yet this is exactly the risk we run when	we assume as we too often do that we can continue to preach the gospel	in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured	men.	3.7071489941213445
8172. until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened	men today can understand we are depriving ourselves of the very resources	on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends.	5.033208254749959
8173. in arguing in this way we are obviously taking for granted	that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved;	and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when	we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction.	3.216523274401279
8174. but the main point	here is that even if such a restatement were not possible the	demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable.	5.43497263762223
8175. this is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without	condition.	4.802942645150291
8176. if to be a christian means to say yes where i otherwise	say no or where i do not have the right to say anything at all then	my only choice is to refuse to be a christian.	6.721923896138535
8177. expressed differently:	if the price for becoming a faithful follower of jesus christ	is some form of self-destruction whether of the body or of the mind-	sacrificium corporis sacrificium intellectus- then there is	no alternative but that the price remain unpaid.	3.3502065739743756
8178. this must be	stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding	chapter.	6.98076672566372
8179. modern man as dietrich bonhoeffer has told us has	come of age; and though this process by no means represents	an unambiguous gain and is in fact marked by the estrangement from	the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation it is still	a positive step forward; and those of us who so richly benefit from	it should be the last to despise it.	3.608540552351136
8180. in any event it is an irreversible	step and if we are at all honest with ourselves we will know we	have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has	seen fit to place us.	6.459544757333374
8181. to say this of course is to take up a	position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred	years or at any rate since the beginning of the distinctively modern	period in theological thought.	4.202111828948231
8182. we have aligned ourselves with that	liberal tradition in protestant christianity that counts among	the great names in its history those of schleiermacher ritschl	herrmann harnack and troeltsch and more recently schweitzer and	the early barth and in part at least bultmann.	4.611724063323505
8183. it is to this same	tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and	a half of american theology also belong.	4.452081760393405
8184. for we must number here not	only the names of bushnell clarke and rauschenbusch not to mention	those of the chicago school and macintosh but those of	the brothers niebuhr and tillich as	well.	5.011751542787661
8185. finally we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously	neoliberal movement that developed at the university	of chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work	of alfred north whitehead.	3.728351261600141
8186. what makes this long and diverse	tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it	have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively	modern world.	5.557481621290925
8187. although they have also been concerned to stand squarely	within the tradition of the apostolic church they have exhibited	no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their christianity.	3.598338487361833
8188. they have insisted rather on living fully and completely	within modern culture and so far from considering this treason to god	have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him.	5.519925104759371
8189. when we say then that today in our situation the demand for	demythologization must be accepted without condition we are simply	saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring	achievement.	3.926894871779476
8190. however much we may have to criticize liberal theology's	constructive formulations the theology we ourselves must strive	to formulate can only go beyond liberalism not behind it.	5.310670150385484
8191. in affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking	the deadlock into which bultmann's attempt to formulate such a	theology has led.	3.408749048128274
8192. for we have said in effect that of the two alternatives	to his position variously represented by the other participants	in the demythologizing discussion only one is really an alternative.	6.096540244879174
8193. if the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be	accepted	by theology unconditionally the position of the right is	clearly untenable.	4.086301289664318
8194. whereas bultmann's center position is structurally	inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds	alone the general position of the right as represented say	by karl barth involves the rejection or at least qualification of	the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material	grounds we have just considered.	5.036811364573823
8195. it follows then provided	the possibilities have been exhausted that the only real alternative	is the general viewpoint of the left which has been represented	on the continent by fritz buri and to some extent at least	is found in much that is significant in american and english theology.	3.4913377365388607
8196. in order to make the implications of our position as clear	as possible we may develop this argument at greater length.	6.306218779631675
8197. we	may show first that there cannot possibly be an alternative other	than the three typically represented by bultmann barth and buri.	3.5777564787477085
8198. to do this it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms	of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more	than two then the question of a third possibility is a meaningless	question.	6.065872908963967
8199. thus if what is at issue is whether all s	is p it is indifferent whether some s is not p	or no s is p since in either case the judgment in question	is false.	3.4253179536910796
8200. hence if what is in question is whether in a given theology	myth is or is not completely rejected it is unimportant whether	only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted;	for in either event the first possibility is excluded.	5.313349685220281
8201. therefore	the only conceivable alternatives are those represented on the one hand	by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive	positions of buri and barth and on the other hand by the third	but really pseudo position of bultmann.	3.442657803386906
8202. a second point requires more extended comment.	6.719325690920467
8203. it will be recalled	from the discussion in section 7 that the position of the right	as represented by barth rests on the following thesis: the	only tenable alternative to bultmann's position is a theology that	rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization	and existential interpretation; accepts instead a	special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation; and	in so doing frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus	christ by means of statements that from bultmann's point of	view are mythological.	3.026180473297082
8204. one hundred years ago there existed in england the association	for the promotion of the unity of christendom.	6.02454822388303
8205. representing	as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the roman	and anglican churches and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable	to rome this association produced little fruit and in fact was	condemned by the holy office in 1864.	3.2297992127599313
8206. now again in 1961 in	england there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly	discussed as christian unity.	5.497200538466723
8207. the church unity octave january	18-25 was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various	churches.	3.5182773778003265
8208. many people seem hopeful yet it is difficult to predict	whether or not there will be any more real attainment of christian	unity in 1961 than there was in 1861.	6.192004342063505
8209. but it must be readily seen	that the religious picture in england has so greatly changed during these	hundred years as to engender hope at least on the catholic side.	3.6919631691987562
8210. for the tide is well on the turn as the london catholic weekly	universe has written.	5.89540723169572
8211. i came to england last summer to	do research on the unpublished letters of cardinal newman.	4.11855048872668
8212. as an	american catholic of irish ancestry i came with certain preconceptions	and expectations; being intellectually influenced by newman	and the general 19th-century literature of england i knew only a	protestant-dominated	country.	4.714541601295105
8213. since arriving here however i have formed	a far different religious picture of present-day england.	3.789726644388646
8214. in representing	part of this new picture i will be recounting some of my	own personal experiences reactions and judgments; but my primary aim	is to transcribe what englishmen themselves are saying and writing	and implying about the roman and anglican churches and about the	present religious	state of england.	4.514293984947672
8215. since the protestant clergy for the	most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit my roman	collar and black garb usually identify me in england as a roman	catholic cleric.	3.243283498163242
8216. in any case i have always been treated with the	utmost courtesy by englishmen even in devonshire and cornwall where	anti-catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest.	5.070648995415523
8217. nowhere have i seen public expression of anti-catholicism.	4.451963187537693
8218. on my first guy fawkes day here i found catholics as well	as non-catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires	and was told that most englishmen either do not know or are not	concerned with the historical significance of the day.	5.264834872925978
8219. a birmingham	newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled the	true story of guy fawkes which began:   when you	pile your	guy on the bonfire tomorrow night i wonder how much of the	true story of guy fawkes you will remember?	3.0284808563640615
8220.  in the 355 years since	the first guy fawkes night much of the story has been forgotten	so here is a reminder.	6.068468681904607
8221. the article proceeded to give an inaccurate	account of a catholic plot to kill king james 1.	3.3855137026552944
8222. in	spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the	conversions of newman and other tractarians of the 1840's and 1850's	the catholic segment of england one hundred years ago was a very	small one which did not enjoy a gracious	hearing from the general public.	4.8129926782692705
8223. the return of the catholic hierarchy	in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and in fact	was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty.	3.2807120389771387
8224. in 1864 newman professedly	had to write his apologia with his keenest feelings in	order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from english readers.	4.918422929052227
8225. now in 1961 the catholic population of england is still	quite small; yet it represents a very	considerable percentage of the churchgoing population.	3.7716244478737524
8226. a protestant	woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the birmingham	oratory church on sunday mornings.	5.54081855933555
8227. she found	this a marvel because as she said only six per cent of english people	are churchgoers.	4.234923273259685
8228. she may not have been exact on this number but	others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than	ten.	6.228771359585714
8229. from many sides come remarks that protestant churches are badly	attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during	services.	3.648001780896767
8230. a catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of	a large city university following anglican evensong at which there	was a congregation of twelve he celebrated mass before more than a	hundred.	4.609519103832224
8231. the protestants themselves are the first to admit the	great falling off in effective membership in their churches.	3.511893549658629
8232. according	to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the church of england	the total of confirmed members is 9748000 but only 2887671	are registered on the parochial church rolls and over 27 million	people in england are baptized into the church of england but	roughly only a tenth of them continue.	5.21963695327131
8233. an amazing article in the	manchester guardian of last november entitled fate of redundant	churches states than an archbishops' commission reported	last month that in the church of england alone there are 790	churches which are redundant now or will be in 20 years' time.	3.5366960897309143
8234. a further	260 anglican churches have been demolished since 1948.	5.7634996553823
8235. and	in the last five years the methodist chapel committee has	authorized	the demolition or more often the sale of 764 chapels.	3.8117970369425014
8236. most of	these former churches are now used as warehouses but neither anglicans	nor	nonconformists object to selling churches to roman catholics	and have done so.	5.177642425434288
8237. while it must be said that these same	protestants have built some new churches during this period and that	religious population shifts have emptied churches a principal reason	for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer protestants are	going to church.	3.4290361917163734
8238. it should be admitted too that there is a good	percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing catholics	.	7.006740847839243
8239. still it is clear from such reports and apparently clear	from the remarks of many people that protestants are decreasing and	catholics increasing.	3.7333439604165135
8240. an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly	but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true.	6.633057083654928
8241. a century ago	newman saw that liberalism would	gradually but definitely make its mark on english protestantism and	that even high anglicanism would someday no longer be a serviceable	breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own.	3.0295770985516803
8242. that day is perhaps today 1961 and it seems no longer very meaningful	to call england a protestant country.	5.542659266849166
8243. one of the ironies	of the present crusade for christian unity is that there are not relatively	speaking many real christians to unite.	4.090059865202238
8244. many english	catholics are proud of their catholicism and know that they are	in a new ascendancy.	6.10383347095067
8245. the london universe devoted its centenary	issue	last december 8 to mapping out various aspects of catholic progress	during the last one hundred years.	3.0904651903760496
8246. with traditional nationalistic spirit	some englishmen claim that english catholicism is catholicism	at its best.	5.380980285930441
8247. i have found myself saying with other foreigners here	that english catholics are good catholics.	4.2017199352674695
8248. it has been my experience	to find as many men as women in church and to hear almost everyone	in church congregations reciting the latin prayers and responses	at mass.	5.273593845425918
8249. they hope of course to reclaim the non-catholic	population to the catholic faith and at every sunday benediction	they recite by heart the prayer for england:   o blessed	virgin mary mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother	look down in mercy upon england thy dowry and upon us	all who greatly hope and trust in thee h.	3.0262441016640587
8250. intercede for our separated	brethren that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the	chief shepherd the vicar of thy son h.	4.988571704288201
8251. a hymn often to be	heard in catholic churches is faith of our fathers which glories	in england's ancient faith that endured persecution and which	proclaims: faith of our fathers: mary's prayersshall win	our country back to thee.	2.9650377659578986
8252. the english saints are widely venerated	quite naturally and now there is great hope that the forty martyrs	and cardinal newman will soon be canonized.	5.20187723041949
8253. because they	have kept the faith of their medieval fathers english catholics have	always strongly resented the charge of being un-english.	3.8206458632882248
8254. i	have not seen this charge made during my stay here but apparently it	is still in the air.	5.492544892111676
8255. for example a writer in a recent number of the	queen hyperbolically states that of the myriad imprecations the	only one which the english catholics really resent is the suggestion	that they are 'un-english'.	3.7151114303996464
8256. in this connection it has been	observed that the increasing number of irish catholics priests and	laity in england while certainly seen as good for catholicism	is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic	english catholics especially when these irishmen offer to remind	their christian brethren of this good.	4.988354587617201
8257. one of the	more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century	is the situation of catholics at oxford and cambridge universities.	3.706069854832126
8258. at oxford one hundred years ago there were very few catholics	partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854.	5.832608538041076
8259. moreover	for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the	city to care for their religious needs.	3.6119838552348535
8260. now not only are there considerably	more laity as students and professors at oxford but there	are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable	and friendly relations with the non-catholic members of the university.	5.07465808363429
8261. some catholic priests lecture there; catholic seminarians attend	tutorials and row on the cherwell with non-catholic students.	3.370558041974044
8262. further evidence that roman catholicism enjoys a more favorable	position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it	in the mass media of england.	5.154334243842565
8263. the general tone of articles appearing	in such important newspapers as the manchester guardian and the	sunday observer implies a kindly recognition that the catholic	church is now at least of equal stature in england with the protestant	churches.	3.114357943888293
8264. on successive sundays during october 1960 paul ferris	wrote articles in the observer depicting	clergymen of the church of england the church of rome and the nonconformist	church.	6.2505284206585605
8265. the catholic priest though somewhat superficially	drawn easily came out the best.	3.42575785417977
8266. there were many letters of strong	protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman who was indeed	portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters	and without really very much to do as clergyman.	5.457768147956681
8267. such a series of	articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-victorian	england.	4.305157981857474
8268. there was so much interest shown in this present-day	venture that it was continued on bbc where comments were	equally made by an anglican parson a free church minister and a catholic	priest.	5.356245724400427
8269. catholic priests have frequently appeared on	television programs sometimes discussing the christian faith on an equal	footing with protestant clergymen.	3.4620640292427383
8270. a notable example of this was	the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool	dr heenan and the anglican archbishop of york dr	ramsey recently appointed archbishop of canterbury.	4.843480097897399
8271. the good	feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now	well known in england.	3.2152370865407938
8272. the holy sacrifice of the mass with commentary	has been televised several times in recent months.	4.852092498841711
8273. and it was	interesting to observe that bbc's television film on christmas	eve was the bells of st mary's.	3.7982601325477643
8274. of course	the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern	of english religious history was the friendly visit paid by dr	fisher then anglican archbishop of canterbury to the vatican	last december.	4.937448836637945
8275. it was the first time an english primate has done	this since the 14th century.	4.723386085426696
8276. english catholics reacted to this event	with moderate but real hope.	5.705999550725924
8277. almost daily something is reported	which feeds this catholic hope in england: statistics of the increasing	numbers of converts and irish catholic immigrants; news of	a protestant minister in leamington who has offered to allow a catholic	priest to preach from his pulpit; a report that a catholic nun	had been requested to teach in a non-catholic secondary school during	the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement in a	respectable periodical that catholics if the present system is still	in operation will constitute almost one-third of the house of lords	in the next generation; a report that 200 protestant clergymen	and laity attended a votive mass offered for christian unity at	a catholic church in slough during the church unity octave.	3.0172864634142296
8278. the death of a man is unique and yet it is universal.	8.218591088745924
8279. the straight	line would symbolize its uniqueness the circle its universality.	3.231121432866412
8280. but	how can one figure symbolize both?	6.341633976502356
8281.    christianity declares that	in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal	concur.	4.43467298643805
8282. perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique	and the universal as clearly or formulated it as precisely as irenaeus.	5.144553454432952
8283. to be the savior and the lord jesus christ has to be a historical	individual with a biography all his own; he dare not be a cosmic	aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself	with man's history.	3.97274891990583
8284. yet this utterly individual historical person	must also contain within himself the common history of mankind.	5.629399713093427
8285. his	history is his alone yet each man must recognize his own history in	it.	3.720949788416813
8286. his death is his alone yet each man can see his own death in the	crucifixion of jesus.	5.65813533812995
8287. each man can identify himself with the history	and the death of jesus christ because jesus christ has identified	himself with human history and human death coming as the head of a	new humanity.	3.878207382447329
8288. not a circle then nor a straight line but a spiral	represents the shape of death as irenaeus sees it; for a spiral has	motion as well as recurrence.	5.933996444243517
8289. as represented by a spiral history may	in some sense be said to repeat itself; yet each historical event	remains unique.	3.8247107100639415
8290. christ is both unique and universal.	6.962256383113929
8291. the first	turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in adam.	3.397624346323783
8292. as	origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning	so irenaeus portrays the story of adam on the basis of the story of	christ.	6.756130370076014
8293. whence then comes the substance of the first man?	4.82949128355497
8294.  from	god's will and wisdom and from virgin earth.	6.3284508121654826
8295. for 'god had	not rained' says the scripture before man was made 'and there	was no man to till the earth'.	3.4264176013264627
8296. from this earth then while it was	still virgin god took dust and fashioned the man the beginning of humanity.	6.05098819892144
8297. irenaeus does not regard adam and eve merely as private	individuals but as universal human beings who were and are all of humanity.	3.626789496709123
8298. adam and eve were perfect not in the sense that they possessed	perfection but in the sense that they were capable of development	toward perfection.	7.086014215619438
8299. they were in fact children.	6.797347156866292
8300. irenaeus does not	claim pre-existence for the human soul; therefore there is no need for	him as there is for origen to identify existence itself with the	fall.	5.553042943882776
8301. existence is created and willed by god and is not the consequence	of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity	into history.	3.754147403742143
8302. historical existence is a created good.	6.810997799768428
8303. the biblical	symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words: so	god created man in his own image; in the similitude of god he created	him.	3.4258609314832613
8304. there are some passages in the writings of irenaeus where	the image of god and the similitude are sharply distinguished so	most notably in the statement: if the holy spirit is absent	from the soul such a man is indeed of an animal nature; and being	left carnal he will be an imperfect being possessing the image	of	god in his formation but not receiving the similitude of god	through the spirit.	5.083239911411595
8305. thus the image of god is that which makes	a man a man and not an oyster; the similitude of god by contrast	is that which makes a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature.	4.115568163732218
8306. recent research on irenaeus however makes it evident that	he does not consistently maintain this distinction.	5.270983442128048
8307. he does not mean	to say that adam lost the similitude of god and his immortality through	the fall; for he was created not exactly immortal nor yet exactly	mortal but capable of immortality as well as of mortality.	3.7603254033301563
8308. therefore irenaeus describes man's creation as follows:	so that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur and become lifted	up as if he had no lord because of the dominion that had been	given to him and the freedom fall into sin against god his creator	overstepping his bounds and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance	towards god a law was given him by god that he might know	that he had for lord the lord of all.	5.07909112322317
8309. and he laid down for him certain	conditions: so that if he kept the command of god then he would	always remain as he was that is immortal; but if he did not he	would become mortal melting into earth whence his frame had been taken.	3.681820086694886
8310. these conditions man did not keep and thus he became mortal;	yet he did not stop being human as a result.	5.842094821803883
8311. there is no justification	for systematizing the random statements of irenaeus about the image	of god beyond this nor for reading into his imprecise usage the	later theological distinction between the image of god and	the similitude of god.	3.366243195726864
8312. man was created with the	capacity for immortality but the devil's promise of immortality	in exchange for disobedience cost adam his immortality.	5.166070294298856
8313. he was in the	words of irenaeus beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality.	4.0354700152923915
8314. the true way to immortality lay through obedience but man	did not believe this.	4.847999854399326
8315. eve was disobedient; for she did	not obey when as yet she was a virgin.	3.798041858972891
8316. and even as she having indeed	a husband adam but being nevertheless as yet a virgin h having	become disobedient was made the cause of death both to herself and	to the entire human race; so also did mary having a man betrothed	to her and being nevertheless a virgin by yielding obedience become	the cause of salvation both to herself and the whole human race.	4.761509381884758
8317. because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere	potentiality or capacity and believes that adam and eve were created	as children irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience	as being due no doubt to carelessness but still wicked.	3.3898428042292923
8318. his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts	him to draw these parallels between the virgin eve and the virgin	mary.	5.925366250929268
8319. that parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too;	for as it was christ the word of god who came to rescue man	so it was disobedience to the word of god in the beginning that brought	death into the world and all our woe.	4.246498571172371
8320. with this act of disobedience	and not with the inception of his individual existence man	began the downward circuit on the spiral of history descending from	the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality.	4.8859984189912895
8321. at	the nadir of that circuit is death.	4.734367793699178
8322. along with the fruit they did	also fall under the power of death because they did eat in disobedience;	and disobedience to god entails death.	5.739789800739551
8323. wherefore as they became	forfeit to death from that moment they were handed over to it.	3.8499394668626157
8324. this leads irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that adam	and eve died on the same day that they disobeyed namely on a friday	as a parallel to the death of christ on good friday; he sees	a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the sabbath.	4.980859923313252
8325. in	any case though they had been promised immortality if they ate of	the tree they obtained mortality instead.	3.7071499768775062
8326. the wages of sin is death.	6.251477478237253
8327. man's life originally shaped for immortality and for communion with	god must now be conformed to the shape of death.	3.470169739057462
8328. nevertheless	even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs	to god and he still rules.	5.377130890722941
8329. even death therefore has a providential	as well as a punitive function.	4.609653802777423
8330. wherefore also he god	drove him man out of paradise and removed him far from the tree	of life not because he envied him the tree of life as some venture	to assert but because he pitied him and did not desire that	he should continue a sinner for ever nor that the sin which surrounded	him should be immortal and evil interminable and irremediable.	4.563319869960713
8331. but	he set a bound to his state of sin by interposing death and thus	causing sin to cease putting an end to it by the dissolution of the	flesh which should take place in the earth so that man ceasing at	length to live in sin and dying to it might live to god.	3.6342999568042305
8332. this	idea which occurs in both tatian and cyprian fits especially well	into the scheme of irenaeus' theology; for it prepares the way for	the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in christ.	4.628792249401666
8333. as man can live only by dying so it was only by his dying that	christ could bring many to life.	3.9616709353284922
8334. it is probably fair to say	that the idea of death is more profound in irenaeus than the idea of	sin is.	5.9959361745965944
8335. this applies to his picture of adam.	4.93682649808767
8336. it is borne out also	by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation	to the next.	5.264071234164937
8337. it becomes most evident in his description of	christ as the second adam who does indeed come to destroy sin but	whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality.	3.4311294198157154
8338. this emphasis	upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem irenaeus	shares with many early theologians especially the greek-speaking ones.	4.761637175865806
8339. they speak of the work of christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility	which can mean deliverance from	time and history.	4.177877770397274
8340. death reminds man of his sin but it reminds	him also of his transience.	5.786199427901247
8341. it represents a punishment that he knows	he deserves but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives	his life within the process of time.	3.8283154294341615
8342. these two aspects of death cannot	be successfully separated but they dare not be confused or identified.	5.929405143969236
8343. the repeated efforts in christian history to describe death as	altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of	death cannot be separated.	3.269682195792774
8344. such efforts almost always find themselves	compelled to ask whether adam was created capable of growing old and	then older and then still older in short whether adam's life was	intended to be part of the process of time.	5.176131490968619
8345. if it was then it must	have been god's intention to translate him at a certain point from	time to eternity.	4.313839688223683
8346. one night so some of these theories run adam would	have fallen asleep much as he fell asleep for the creation of eve;	and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal.	6.04636241588565
8347. the	embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an	illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment for	some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the	natural order of time and change.	3.4547764592500863
8348. on the other hand christian	faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal	existence.	7.50190134706111
8349. it is the wages of sin and its sting is the law.	4.686543995963939
8350. if	this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea	of death as natural termination the conclusion seems inevitable that	temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state	into which man is put by the will of the creator.	5.297026626162503
8351. this seems to have	been the conclusion to which origen was forced.	4.3565682643636805
8352. if death receives	more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives	less than its share the gift of the life eternal through christ	begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal	ie created existence.	5.193788875788862
8353. such an interpretation of death radically	alters the christian view of creation; for it teaches salvation	from not salvation in time and history.	3.7058999640276453
8354. because christianity	teaches not only salvation in history but salvation by the history of	christ such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision	of the christian understanding of the work of christ.	5.768583940038669
8355. furthermore as an encouragement to revisionist thinking it manifestly	is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right	to refuse to accept persons it dislikes.	3.393891256424477
8356. the unitarian clergy were	an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen- as the term was then understood	in the back bay- and parker was definitely not a gentleman	either in theology or in manners.	4.334547928676315
8357. ezra stiles gannett an honorable	representative of the sanhedrin addressed himself frankly to the	issue in 1845 insisting that parker should not be persecuted or calumniated	and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force	could exist.	3.053015413871221
8358. even so gannett judiciously argued the association could	legitimately decide that parker should not be encouraged nor	assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard	to their correctness.	5.28267467755347
8359. we today are not entitled to excoriate	honest men who believed parker to be downright pernicious and who	barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their	congregations.	3.3420930103675492
8360. one can even argue- though this is a delicate matter-	that every justification existed for their returning the public lecture	to the first church and so to suppress it rather than let parker	use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should	come to occupy it.	5.05175479212214
8361. finally it did seem clear as day to these clergymen	as gannett's son explained in the biography of his father	they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title	of christians.	3.2954684143819013
8362. their demand against the calvinist orthodoxy for	intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow free inquiry	to the extreme of proclaiming christianity a natural religion.	4.948025997875456
8363. grant all this- still when modern unitarianism and	the harvard divinity school recall with humorous affection the insults	parker lavished upon them or else argue that after all parker	received the treatment he invited they betray an uneasy conscience.	2.933903996277638
8364. whenever new england liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation	of parker and the fraternity on january 23 1843- while it	may defend the privilege of chandler robbins to demand that parker	leave the association while it may plead that dr n l frothingham	had every warrant for stating the difference between trinitarians	and unitarians is a difference in christianity; the difference	between mr parker and the association is a difference	between no christianity and christianity- despite these supposed	conclusive assurances the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh	of relief of positive thanksgiving that the association never quite	brought itself officially to expel parker.	4.357130830188547
8365. had it done so the blot	on its escutcheon would have remained indelible nor could the harvard	divinity school assemble today to honor parker's insurgence other	than by getting down on its collective knees and crying peccavi.	3.2231226919297034
8366. happily for posterity then the boston association did	not actually command parker to leave the room though it came too close	for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality.	5.5259675278279285
8367. fortunately	the honor of the denomination can attest that cyrus bartol	defended parker's sincerity as did also gannett and chandler	robbins; whereupon parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and	rushed out of the room though not out of the fellowship.	3.565814365858923
8368. in the	hall after adjournment dr frothingham took him warmly by the	hand	and requested parker to visit him- whereupon our burly theodore	again burst into tears.	4.495352472119497
8369. all this near tragedy which to us borders	on comedy enables us to tell the story over and over again always	warming ourselves with a glow of complacency.	3.6609092408785826
8370. it was indeed a near	thing but somehow the inherent decency of new england	did triumph.	5.583198942665268
8371. to the extent	that he was ostracized or even reviled we solace ourselves by saying	he asked for it.	3.6141751560586965
8372. yet even after all these stratagems the conscience	of christian liberality is still not laid to rest any more than is	the conscience of harvard university for having done the abject penance	for its rejection of ralph waldo emerson's the divinity school	address of naming its hall of philosophy after him.	4.657129544933406
8373. in both cases	the stubborn fact remains: liberalism gave birth to two brilliant	apostates both legitimate offspring of its loins and when brought	to the test it behaved shabbily.	3.1969626910247557
8374. suppose they both had ventured into	realms which their colleagues thought infidel: is this the way gentlemen	settle frank differences of opinion?	5.198312495160835
8375.  is it after all possible	that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity	they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any	conservative has ever to worry about?	3.5123606313529296
8376.    however there is a crucial	difference between the two histories.	8.804203198175276
8377. emerson evaded the problem	by shoving it aside or rather by leaving it behind him: he walked	out of the unitarian communion so that it could lick the wound of his	departure preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious	veneration.	3.082365130708465
8378. parker insisted upon not resigning even when the majority	wanted him to depart upon daring the fellowship to throw him	out.	5.317808893478075
8379. hence he was in his lifetime as is the memory of him afterwards	a canker within the liberal sensitivity.	4.297013098049817
8380. he still points an accusing	finger at all of us telling us we have neither the courage to support	him nor the energy to cut his throat.	5.423241515532364
8381. actually the dispute	between parker and the society of his time both ecclesiastical and	social was a real one a bitter one.	4.144865528306875
8382. it cannot be smoothed over by	now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or	by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections	to him.	5.043918094936745
8383. the fact is incontestable: that liberal world of unitarian	boston was narrow-minded intellectually sterile smug afraid	of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm	and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle	foundations were threatened.	2.985749667500261
8384. parker along with garrison and	charles sumner showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs	mobilized in defense of the mexican war and slavery.	5.107395727535851
8385. nevertheless	we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace;	their passions were genuine and the division between them and the abolitionists	is clear-cut.	3.3986217811222077
8386. but parker as the ultra-liberal minister within	the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository	of liberality poses a different problem which is not to be resolved by	holding him up as the champion of freedom.	5.064951556823291
8387. even though his theological	theses have become to us commonplaces the fundamental interrogation	he phrased is very much with us.	4.001888398904041
8388. it has been endlessly rephrased	but i may here put it thus: at what point do the tolerant find themselves	obliged to become intolerant?	5.2875642368055935
8389.  and then as they become aware	that they have reached the end of their patience what do they to	their dismay learn for the first time about themselves?	4.360804258948505
8390.    there	can be no doubt the boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel	in enforcing its canons of behavior.	5.4383984531921605
8391. the gentle channing revered	by all bostonians orthodox or unitarian wrote to a friend in louisville	that among its many virtues boston did not abound in a tolerant	spirit that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and	action: no city in the world is governed so little by a police	and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment.	3.0738040252206544
8392. we stand more in awe of one another than most people.	6.508216165274879
8393. opinion is	less individual or runs more into masses and often rules with a rod	of iron.	3.44352777907012
8394. even more poignantly and with the insight of a genius	channing added- remember this is channing not parker!-	that should a minister in boston trust himself to his heart should	he speak without book and consequently break some law of speech	or be hurried into some daring hyperbole he should find little mercy.	4.673173459491921
8395. channing wrote this- in a letter! i think it fair to	say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons.	3.475381305940183
8396. but theodore	parker commencing his mission to the world-at-large disguised	as the minister of a twenty-eighth congregational church which	bore no resemblance to the congregational polities descended from the	founders made explicit	from the beginning that the conflict between him and the hunkerish	society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel	difference about clerical decorum.	4.6853630814181075
8397. because he spoke openly with what	channing had prophesied someone might- with daring hyperbole- parker	vindicated channing's further prophecy that he who committed	this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals	were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines.	3.0518852787397006
8398. an institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an	institution and only within those defined limits a license.	5.187441221789607
8399. by reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation we should	i am sure come to a fresh realization however painful it be that the	battle between parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest.	3.624067440284289
8400. he	arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had	to respond with at the least resentment.	5.244682499930239
8401. what otherwise could the	lawyer doctor minister the men of science and letters do when	told that they had become the cherubim and seraphim and the three	archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant and continually	cried 'holy holy holy is the almighty	dollar'?	3.2594515656117626
8402. 	nor when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old puritan	stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration should we be	astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of	rage as parker snarled at them thus: talk about the catholics	voting as the bishop tells! reproach the catholics for it! you	and i do the same thing.	4.522707503419833
8403. there are a great many bishops who have never	had a cross on their bosom nor a mitre on their head who appeal not	to the authority of the pope at rome but to the almighty dollar	a pope much nearer home.	3.453354427969674
8404. boston has been controlled by a few capitalists	lawyers and other managers who told the editors what to say and	the preachers what to think.	5.403380083117825
8405. parker meant business.	6.747786762435577
8406. and he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended	them: even the unitarian churches have caught the malaria	and are worse than those who deceived them- which implied that they	were very bad indeed.	4.940986279059872
8407. it was duty he said that his parents	had given him as a rule- beyond even the love that suffused his	being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied- and	it was duty he would perform though it cost him acute pain and exhausted	him by the age of fifty.	3.7529340296462874
8408. parker could weep- and he wept astonishingly	often and on the slightest provocation- but the psychology of	those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to	massacre his opponents.	4.958052313763053
8409. if it gave me pleasure to say hard things	he wrote i would shut up forever.	4.121260899423509
8410. we have to tell ourselves	that when parker spoke in this vein he believed what he said because	he could continue but the truth which cost me bitter	tears to say i must speak though it cost other tears hotter than	fire.	5.154764525077889
8411. because he copiously shed his own tears and yielded himself	up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of new england	he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's	consciences.	3.3907267585490612
8412. our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how	strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very	issue which in the boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its	christian survival that of the literal factual historicity of the	miracles as reported in the four gospels.	5.210557296157125
8413. it is idle to ask why we	are no longer disturbed if somebody professing the deepest piety	decides anew	that it is of no importance whether or not christ transformed the	water into wine at eleven a m on the third of august a	d 32.	3.3393257543028363
8414. we have no answer as to why we are not alarmed.	8.157636431652277
8415. so we are	the more prepared to give parker the credit for having taken the right	side in an unnecessary controversy to salute his courage and to pass	on happily forgetting both him and the entire episode.	3.341187550790181
8416. we have not	the leisure or the patience or the skill to comprehend what was working	in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard	divinity school who would muster the audacity to contradict his most	formidable instructor the majesterial andrews norton by saying	that while he believed jesus like other religious teachers worked	miracles i see not how a miracle proves a doctrine.	4.449246213449844
8417. i have within the past fifty years come out of all uncertainty	into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the truth and about	which i have not a shadow of doubt.	3.759317458306925
8418. it has been my lot all through	life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with	them the deepest and most vital of all questions the nature of the	hope of a life beyond this.	5.540486853363688
8419. i have also constantly engaged in scientific	work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science	as well as in the religions in the world.	4.08654615629189
8420. in an amateurish yet in	a very real sense i have followed the developments of archaeology geology	astronomy herpetology and mycology with a hearty appreciation	of the advances being made in these fields.	5.047992786797264
8421. at one time i became	disturbed in the faith in which i had grown up by the apparent	inroads being made upon both old and new testaments by a higher	criticism of the bible to refute which i felt the need of a better	knowledge of hebrew and of archaeology for it seemed to me that	to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure.	3.5776629349645486
8422. doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while	and like some higher critical friends trying to continue to use the	bible as the word of god while at the same time holding it to have	been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations:	attempting to bridge the chasm between an older reverent bible-loving	generation and a critical doubting bible-emancipated race.	4.759728577819451
8423. although	still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the book i	stood outside shivering in the cold.	3.762642732488633
8424. in one thing the higher	critics like the modernists however overreached themselves in claiming	that the gospel of john was not written in john's time but	well after the first century perhaps as late as 150 ad.	5.290001396740198
8425. now	if any part of the bible is assuredly the very word of god speaking	through his servant it is john's gospel.	4.147474301548468
8426. to ask me to believe	that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the	events by some admiring follower and was not inspired directly by the	spirit of god is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any	of those recorded in the bible.	4.820261325239203
8427. here i took my leave of my learned	friends to step out on another path to which we might give the modern	name of pragmatism or the thing that works.	3.8048213321962416
8428. test it try it and	if it works accept it as a guiding principle.	6.027727944208044
8429. so i put my	bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself and	then tested it to see how it worked.	3.8264340291824688
8430. as a short possibly not the best	method i looked up word in the concordance and noted that	the bible claims from genesis 1 to revelation 22 to be god's personal	message to man.	4.836302840197539
8431. the next traditional step then was to accept it	as the authoritative textbook of the christian faith just as one would	accept a treatise on any earthly science and i submitted to	its conditions according to christ's invitation and promise that	if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether	it be of god or whether i speak of myself.	3.043493628294342
8432. the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance	of the bible as the word of god inspired in a sense utterly	different from any merely human book and with it the acceptance of	our lord jesus christ as the only begotten son of god son of man	by the virgin mary the saviour of the world.	5.525980300606472
8433. i believe	therefore that we are without exception sinners by nature alienated	from god and that jesus christ the son of god came to earth	the representative head of a new race to die upon the cross and pay	the penalty of the sin of the world and that he who thus receives christ	as his personal saviour is born again spiritually with new	privileges appetites and affections destined to live and grow in	his likeness forever.	3.514199562057722
8434. nor can any man save himself by good works or	by a commendable moral life although such works are the natural	fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally	expressing itself through such avenues.	4.680945435522404
8435. i now ever look for	christ acording to his promises and those of the old testament as	well to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness	over the whole earth.	3.541365810962397
8436. to state fully what the bible	means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to	formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and	friends.	4.926229120491665
8437. the bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as	bread is food for the body.	3.6129055922015896
8438. again as faith reveals god my father	and christ my saviour i follow without question where he leads me	daily by his spirit of love wisdom power and prayer.	4.860087186335298
8439. i place his	precepts and his leadings above every seeming probability dismissing	cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed	to him.	3.407456584265559
8440. i discern no limits to a faith vested in god and christ	who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge and daring to trust him	even though called to stand alone before the world.	4.918873037437736
8441. our lord's	invitation with its implied promise to all is come and see.	3.9958312180759723
8442. i stood at the bedside of my patient one day and beheld	a very sick man in terrible pain.	5.435940631258723
8443. as i ministered to his needs	i noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and i	learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and	nurse but also the lord.	3.862074580204464
8444. in his heart he had that peace of which	the lord spoke when he said peace i leave with you my peace	i give unto you: not as the world giveth give i unto you.	5.39557932853944
8445. let	not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid.	3.9978090192453273
8446. what	a joy to realize that we too can claim this promise tendered by	the lord during his earthly ministry to a group of men who were very	dear to him.	5.764656861042203
8447. he was about to leave them to depart from this world	and return to his father in heaven.	4.4111026810717116
8448. before he left them he promised	that his peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts	and minds.	5.711577755176748
8449. i praise god for the privilege of being a nurse who	has that peace through faith in the lord jesus christ.	4.02329238508362
8450. it makes	my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the lord's guidance	while ministering to the physical needs of my patients.	6.234791681247996
8451. how	often have i looked to jesus when entering the sick room asking	for his presence and help in my professional duties as i give my talents	not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the saviour and	his creatures.	3.1770223821547345
8452. looking unto god the prophet isaiah wrote	these blessed words almost three thousand years ago: thou wilt	keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee: because	he trusteth in thee.	4.491731085061009
8453. are you longing for peace in your heart?	5.068006939683588
8454. 	such a calm and assuring peace can be yours.	5.56153871170725
8455. as only a member	of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family likewise	one must belong to the family of god in order to receive the benefits	that are promised to those who are his own.	4.629621937696767
8456. perhaps you are	not his child.	8.859984905275976
8457. perhaps you do not know if you belong to him.	5.585876103938386
8458. you	may know that you are in god's family and be just as sure of it as	you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father.	6.107302335826347
8459. god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that	whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life	and as many as received him to them gave he power to become	the sons of god even to them that believe on his name.	3.5673624442326837
8460. it is to those who believe on his name and belong to him that	he gives his peace; not that empty peace the world offers but a deep	abiding peace which nothing can destroy.	5.415363343584309
8461. why not open your	heart to the lord jesus christ now accept him as your saviour	and	let him fill you with peace that only he can give.	3.7034309126408194
8462. then	with the hymn writer of old you can say:   i am resting today	in his wonderful peace   resting sweetly in jesus' control.	4.6426816166964775
8463. i am kept from all danger by night and by day   and	his glory is flooding my soul.	3.685464016061872
8464. satellites sputniks rockets	balloons; what next?	6.594764477696897
8465.  our necks are stiff from gazing at	the wonders of outer space which have captured the imagination of the	american public.	3.457892403472735
8466. cape canaveral's achievements thunder forth from	the radio television and newspaper.	5.404264865830375
8467. while we are filling	outer space with scientific successes for many the inner space	of their soul is an aching void.	3.57651653752568
8468. proof?	11.55875815210223
8469.  an average of 50 suicides	are reported in america each day! one out of every three or	four marriages end in divorce! over $200000000 is paid yearly to	the 80000 full-time fortune-tellers in the united states by fearful	mankind who want to know what the future holds! delinquency	juvenile and adult is at an all-time high! further proof?	3.245029731560256
8470.  read	your daily newspaper!   unfortunately in our rush to beat	the russians we have forgotten these truth-packed words of jesus christ:	what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world	that includes outer space and lose his own soul?	4.47716513338756
8471.  or what	shall a man give in exchange for his soul?	4.643684477459862
8472. .	11.55875815210223
8473. gaining outer space and losing inner space is bad business	according to god's standards.	3.7196469621066246
8474. it is true that we must	keep up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments; only	a fool would think otherwise.	5.283745588990326
8475. but we must not forget man's soul.	5.785908069487176
8476. is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant as the good news	that god put his son	jesus christ on earth to live and die to	save our hell-bound souls?	5.0551715614097885
8477.  for god so loved the world that	he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should	not perish but have everlasting life.	3.4811681348311905
8478. never	forget that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.	5.702283871713751
8479. your spiritual	inner space helps determine the spirituality of america	as a nation.	3.8471998030123866
8480. we trust you are not one of the 70000000 americans	who do not attend church but who feel that various forms of recreation	are more important than worshipping the god who made our country great.	5.633814608757403
8481. is forgiveness of past sins assurance of present help and	hope of future bliss in your orbit?	3.7108523708143766
8482.  or are you trying the devil's	substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within?	5.879261652555831
8483.  pleasure	fame and fortune drowning your troubles with a drink and living	it up with the gang are like candy bars when you're hungry:	they may ease your hunger temporarily but they'll never take the	place of a satisfying mouth-watering steak.	2.917642418491597
8484. no amount of religious ceremonies or even joining a church will	relieve the gnawing of your inner space.	5.619105658640828
8485. why?	7.781497302878112
8486.  because your	soul was made to be filled with god himself not religious functions	about him.	6.65867103696849
8487. only he can satisfy the deepest longings.	5.592726063244355
8488. that	is why the bible commands you to taste and see that the lord	is good: blessed happy is the man that trusteth in him	.	5.46932247693705
8489. you can receive god into your heart and life	by a step of personal faith.	4.064687607745193
8490. accept the sinless son of god jesus	christ as your own personal saviour.	6.082758022144972
8491. as many as received him	jesus to them gave he power to become the sons of god even	to them that believe on his name	the lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall i fear?	3.8219483732675825
8492. 	the lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall i be	afraid?	6.304822111927532
8493. 	psalm 27:1   a certain teacher scheduled a fear party	for her fourth grade pupils.	3.3616847520757784
8494. it was a session at which all the youngsters	were told to express their fears to get them out in the open	where they could talk about them freely.	5.821201583663147
8495. the teacher thought it was	so successful that she asks: wouldn't it be helpful to all age	groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their	fears and worries?	3.2995464309727334
8496.    dr george w crane a medical	columnist thinks it would.	6.193360935050495
8497. he says: that would reduce neurotic	ailments tremendously.	4.3300517339264335
8498. each week an estimated 20 million patients call	upon us doctors.	6.259033663975232
8499. of this number 50% or 10 million patients have	no diagnosable physical ailments whatever.	4.033578881130025
8500. yet they keep running from one physician to another largely to get	a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles.	5.320220639543451
8501. one of	the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus	be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions.	3.5055779678640695
8502. we are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to	deal with the problem of fear these days.	6.764440907428318
8503. it must be getting more serious.	6.1146611138499685
8504. people are giving their doctors a hard time.	7.010465065851372
8505. one doctor made	a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles and	he reported that 40% of them worried about things that never happened;	30% of them worried about past happenings which were completely	beyond their control; 12% of them worried about their health	although their ailments were imaginary; 10% of them worried about	their friends neighbors and relatives most of whom were quite capable	of taking care of themselves.	3.150991372948946
8506. only 8% of the worries had behind	them real causes which demanded attention.	5.993383663047333
8507. well most of our	fears may be unfounded but after you discover that fact you have something	else to worry about: why then do we have these fears?	3.6129932292000677
8508.  what	is the real cause of them?	6.889674303622625
8509.  what is there about us that makes us so	anxious?	5.053666721368359
8510.    look at the things we do to escape our fears and	to forget our worries.	6.400291472100651
8511. we spend millions of dollars every year on fortune	tellers and soothsayers.	4.580132918646674
8512. we spend billions of dollars at the race	tracks and more billions on other forms of gambling.	6.24929893074282
8513. we spend billions	of dollars on liquor and many more billions on various forms of	escapist entertainment.	3.8690333105819814
8514. we consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers	and sleeping pills in order to get a moment's relief from the tensions	that are tearing us apart.	5.579202191048803
8515. a visitor from a more peaceful	country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks and after	he had seen it all he said to a friend: you must be a very	sad people.	3.8004250629601812
8516. sad was not the right word of course.	7.607071325654213
8517. he should	have said jittery for that's what we are.	3.9516172054671284
8518. and that's worse	than sad.	7.77516607827678
8519. watch people flock to amusement houses cocktail lounges	and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment which means	an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed	to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give	men a few hours of dubious relaxation- watch them and you can tell	that many of them are running away from something.	3.1897787789794743
8520. in one of	his writings pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign	of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates.	4.933928720633632
8521. yes	and as tension mounts in this world fear is increasing.	4.0006997927069365
8522. does that	explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business?	6.0915478848605975
8523. 	we have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons	dreadful things which are too horrible to contemplate.	3.7244186552969794
8524. i doubt that	fear parties and group confessionals will help very much.	6.0063053655761784
8525. suppose we do get our fears out in the open what then?	4.954391498876077
8526.  isn't that	where most of them are already- right out on the front page of our	newspapers?	7.043842404167363
8527.  maybe we are talking about them too much.	4.85416727613135
8528. the question	is: what are we going to do about them?	5.810146625363867
8529.    meanwhile the	enemy will capitalize on our fears if he can.	4.252772480322769
8530. hitler did just that	23 years ago building up tensions that first led to a munich and then	to a world war.	5.216465795598761
8531. the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand	and too willing to compromise or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate	for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate.	3.3282260833473836
8532. it is	said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals	to attack.	5.626011924042856
8533. it could have the same effect on communists.	6.226947781074908
8534. the president	of the united states has said: we will never negotiate out	of fear and we will never fear to negotiate.	5.99111147552421
8535. that is a sound position	but it is important that moscow shall recognize it not merely	as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not	afraid.	4.485396528030989
8536. and that's another reason why it is imperative for us these	days to conquer our fears to develop the poise that promotes peace.	5.396267208501804
8537. turning to the word of god we find the only sure way to do	that.	4.936476588559736
8538. in psalm 27:1 you read those beautiful words which you must	have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you	or to drive them out if they have you in their grip: the lord	is my light and my salvation; whom shall i fear?	5.116360677579493
8539.  the lord is the	strength of my life; of whom shall i be afraid?	3.6941072716443473
8540.    well	you say those are beautiful words all right but it was easy for the	psalmist to sing them in his day.	5.612415534267764
8541. he didn't live in a world of perpetual	peril like ours.	4.783197965923175
8542. he didn't know anything about the problems	we face today.	6.233311795605493
8543. no?	7.781497302878112
8544.  read the next two verses: when the	wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh	they stumbled and fell.	5.107444827389438
8545. though an host should encamp against me my	heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me in this will	i be confident.	3.4631328451436505
8546. that is almost a perfect description of	the predicament in which we find ourselves today isn't it?	6.479837614943512
8547.  our	enemy is also threatening to devour us.	4.234630566931287
8548. he has already devoured huge	areas of the world putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains	and barbed wire reducing them to slavery systematically crushing	not only their bodies but their souls and shooting them to death if they	try to escape their prison.	4.829310972198909
8549. yes indeed we too can see a warlike	host of infidels encamped against us.	3.9617682749452405
8550. what a terrible thing that	wailing wall in berlin! a man with a baby in his arms stood	there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest	of the family.	6.4587218113724525
8551. another man tried to swim across the river from the east	to the west but was shot and killed.	3.880615396906527
8552. a middle aged woman opened	a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall	she threw out a few belongings and then jumped; she was fatally injured.	4.966879504786916
8553. the entrance to a church has been walled up so that the congregation	most of which is in the western sector cannot worship god there	anymore.	4.376516767429673
8554. practically everybody in berlin has relatives and friends	that live in the opposite part of the city.	6.96513631001154
8555. people stand at the wall	giving vent to their feelings weeping pounding it with their fists	pleading for loved ones.	3.73769027998704
8556. but the enemy answers them from loudspeakers	that pour out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible	profanity.	5.433758768668446
8557. there is only one escape left a tragic one and too	many people are taking it: suicide.	4.018148142041853
8558. the normal rate of suicides in	east berlin was one a day but since the border was closed on august	13 it has jumped to 25 a day!   these things may be happening	many miles away from us but really they are right next door.	4.535719088993202
8559. we are	all involved in them deeply involved.	4.8026580281048785
8560. and nobody knows what comes next.	7.322541055967703
8561. we live from crisis to crisis.	5.160198451182626
8562. and there is only one way for a	man to conquer his fears in such a world.	7.038322994550663
8563. he must learn to say with	true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world: the lord	is my light and my salvation; whom shall i fear?	3.8335927050958403
8564.  the lord is the	strength of my life; of whom shall i be afraid?	5.487284886041945
8565. 	notice	that this man had a threefold conception of god which is the secret	of his faith.	3.8739274345441124
8566. first the lord is my light.	10.104809207205422
8567. he lived in a	very dark world but he was not in the dark.	5.560790298113472
8568. the same god who called	this world into being when he said: let there be light!-	those were his very first creative words- he began the world with	light- this god still gives light to a world which man has plunged	into darkness.	4.720363619460995
8569. for those who put their trust in him he still says	every day again: let there be light! and there is light!	in fact he came into this world himself in the person of	his son jesus christ who stood here amid the darkness of human	sin and said: i am the light of the world: he that followeth	me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life.	3.4228495470223406
8570. the	psalmist could say that god was his light even though he could only	anticipate the coming of christ.	5.795928650417148
8571. he lived in the dawn; he could	only see the light coming over the horizon.	4.260381719447958
8572. we live in the bright daylight	of that great event; for us it is a fact in history.	6.985408696370114
8573. why should	we not have the same faith and an even greater experience of the light	which it gives?	4.464263598751808
8574.    this is the faith that moved the psalmist	to add his second conception of god: the lord is h my salvation.	5.7342937528358675
8575. he knew that his god would save him from his enemies	because he had saved him from his sins.	3.951660869315043
8576. if god could do that he could	do anything.	7.678409588010379
8577. the enemies at his gate threatening to eat up his	flesh were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul.	3.342038307628037
8578. and god had conquered that one by his grace! so why worry about	all the others?	5.323099456940008
8579.    the apostle paul said the same thing in the	language and faith of the new testament: he that spared not	his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with	him freely give us all things?	3.319816895560335
8580.  h if god be for us who can be	against us?	7.030349839924386
8581.  h who shall separate us from the love of christ?	4.820737611194186
8582. 	shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness	or peril or sword?	4.888066795226644
8583.    salvation!	this is the key to	the conquest of fear.	4.499779459896749
8584. this gets down to the heart of our problem for	it reconciles us with god whom we fear most of all because we have	sinned against him.	5.972960223166422
8585. when that fear has been removed by faith in jesus	christ when we know that he is our savior that he has paid our	debt with his blood that he has met the demands of god's justice	and thus has turned his wrath away- when we know that we have peace	with god in our hearts; and then with this god on our side	we can face the whole world without fear.	3.7019134934679174
8586. and so the psalmist	gives us one more picture of god: the lord is the strength	of my life.	6.002129239479001
8587. the word is really stronghold.	5.04849511135898
8588. it recalls those	words of another psalm: god is our refuge and strength a very	present help in trouble.	5.319347230298789
8589. therefore will not we fear though the earth	be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the	sea h come behold the works of the lord what desolations he	hath made in the earth.	3.641875503317192
8590. but again we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until	the close of the ninth century ad when an arabic scholar tabit	ibn korra is said to have discussed the magic square of	three.	5.530925201356474
8591. thus while it remains possible that the babylonians andor	the pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before	the chinese did more definite evidence will have to turn up from	the middle east or the classical world before china can lose her	claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years.	3.390564842834179
8592. the	concept of the middle kingdom at peace strong and united under a	forceful ruler which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of	the	warring states was finally realized by the establishment of a chinese	empire under the ch'in dynasty.	5.126619940166021
8593. but this	was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian	despotism.	3.8126636758931545
8594. among the many severe measures taken by the first emperor	shih huang-ti in his efforts to insure the continuation of	this hard-won national unity was the burning of the books in 213 bc	with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for	divergent thinking; but as he had a special fondness for magic and	divination he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared.	4.767577334979239
8595. many of the latter were destroyed in their turn during the burning	of the vast ch'in palace some ten years later; yet some must have	survived because the old interest in number symbolism divination	and magic persisted on into the han dynasty which succeeded in reuniting	china and keeping it together for a longer period	.	3.189367165473345
8596. in fact during	the first century bc an extensive literature sprang up devoted	to these subjects finding its typical expression in the so-called	wei books a number of which were specifically devoted to	the lo shu and related numerical diagrams especially in connection	with divination.	4.917973242323508
8597. however the wei books were also destroyed	in a series of orthodox confucian purges which culminated in a final	proscription in 605.	3.67090209416397
8598. after all this destruction of old literature	it should be obvious why we have so little information about the	early history and development of the lo shu which was already	semisecret anyhow.	5.744135694986914
8599. but in spite of all this enough evidence remains	to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object	of a rather extensive cult- or series of cults- reaching fullest	expression in the han period.	3.748108702864552
8600. although modern scholars have	expressed surprise that the simple magic square of three a mere	mathematical puzzle was able to exert a considerable influence	on the minds and imaginations of the cultured chinese for so many centuries	they could have found most of the answers right within the square	itself.	5.124701363244342
8601. but up to now no one has attempted to analyze its inherent	mathematical properties or the numerical significance of its numbers-	singly or in combination- and then tried to consider these in	the light of old chinese cosmological concepts.	3.2719387001303395
8602. such an analysis	speedily reveals why the middle number of the lo shu 5	was so vitally significant for the chinese ever since the earliest hints	that they had a knowledge of this diagram.	5.880746835400831
8603. the importance of this	5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of	the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the	numbers- quite apart from any numerological considerations which is	to say any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it.	3.1945116988135998
8604. indeed mathematically	speaking it was both functionally and symbolically the most	important number in the entire diagram.	5.716019820085671
8605. if one takes the middle	number 5 and multiplies it by 3	the result is 15 which is also the constant sum of	all the rows columns and two main diagonals.	3.59043368440121
8606. then if the middle number	is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square through	multiplying it by the highest number 9	the result is 45; and the latter is the total sum	of all the numbers in the square by which all the other numbers are	overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed.	6.020610775741119
8607. furthermore	the middle number of the lo shu is not only the physical	mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers by reason of	its central position; it is also their mathematical mean since it	is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair all of which equal 10.	3.7429478346254883
8608. in fact the neat balance of these pairs and their subtle equilibrium	would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese.	6.066873712547195
8609. for they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female	equating the two groups with the yang and yin principles in nature;	and in this square the respective pairs made up of large and	small odd numbers and those composed of large and small even	numbers were all equal to each other.	3.2123601663963575
8610. thus all differences were	leveled and all contrasts erased in a realm of no distinction and	the harmonious balance of the lo shu square could effectively	symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis.	5.275508590845725
8611. the tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the lo shu square-	for purely mathematical reasons- and the fact that this number so	neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe could well explain	why the old chinese seem to have so revered the number 5 and	why they put so much stress on the concept of centrality.	3.746464545865706
8612. these twin	tendencies seem to have reached their height in the han dynasty.	6.8090070896844725
8613. the existing reverence for centrality must have been still further	stimulated toward the close of the second century bc when	the han emperor wu ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow-	which symbolized the center among the traditional five directions-	and took 5 as the dynastic number believing that he would thus	place himself his imperial family and the nation under the most auspicious	influences.	3.1078109147962807
8614. his immediate motive for doing this may not have	been directly inspired by the lo shu but this measure must inevitably	have increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy.	5.215406476624809
8615. after this time inscriptions on the han bronze mirrors as well	as other writings emphasized the desirability of keeping one's	self at the center of the universe where cosmic forces were strongest.	3.7976329322496243
8616. later we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too	literally.	6.751525281022383
8617. all this emphasis on centrality and on the number	5 as a symbolic expression of the center which seems to have begun	as far back as 400 bc also may conceivably have led to the development	of the five-elements school and the subsequent efforts to	fit everything into numerical categories of five.	3.568987383268517
8618. we find for example	such groupings as the five ancient rulers the five sacred mountains	the five directions the five metals five	colors five tastes five odors five musical notes five	bodily functions five viscera and many others.	4.606808967283235
8619. this trend has	often been ascribed to the cult of the five elements itself as though	they had served as the base for all the rest; but why did the old	chinese postulate five elements when the ancient near east-	which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence	in human life and activities- recognized only four?	3.2555930214496986
8620.  and why	did the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five directions	when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only	the usual four?	5.179116082811465
8621.  obviously something suddenly caused them to start	thinking in terms of fives and that may have been the workings of	the lo shu.	4.2776860748640635
8622. this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect	on chinese thinking.	6.136348627892933
8623. whereas the primary meanings of the lo shu	diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties-	and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on	some mathematical bases- the urgent desire to place everything into	categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers until	an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded chinese thought.	3.170734928657784
8624. scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in nature	or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things in a fashion that	seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical and	philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought	in china for many centuries.	4.51511312886481
8625. square	although the primary mathematical properties of the middle	number at the center of the lo shu and the interrelation	of all the other numbers to it might seem enough to account for the deep	fascination which the lo shu held for the old chinese philosophers	this was actually only a beginning of wonders.	3.91682508490039
8626. for the lo	shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief	religious and philosophical ideas of its time.	5.966464566199301
8627. as such one cannot	fully understand the thought of the pre-han and han periods without	knowing the meanings inherent in the lo shu; but conversely	one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something	about the world view of the old chinese which they felt they	saw expressed in it.	3.6252210131144285
8628. the chinese world view during the han dynasty	when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its	popularity was based in large part on the teachings of the yin-yang	and five-elements school which was traditionally founded by tsou	yen.	5.182662757701921
8629. according to this doctrine the universe was ruled by heaven	t'ien- as a natural force or in the personification of a supreme	sky-god- governing all things by means of a process called the	tao	which can be roughly interpreted as the order of the universe	or the universal way.	3.6019551197328727
8630. heaven acting through the tao	expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles	the yin and the yang.	5.373695257694681
8631. the yang or male principle was the source	of light heat and dynamic vitality associated with the sun; while	the yin or female principle flourished in darkness cold and quiet	inactivity and was associated with the moon.	3.0942252193977122
8632. together these two	principles influenced all things and in varying combinations they were	present in everything.	5.660509785022628
8633. we have already seen that odd numbers	were considered as being yang while the even numbers were yin so	that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two	principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center.	3.355941318270059
8634. during	the han dynasty another yin-yang conception was applied to the lo	shu considering the latter as a plan of ancient china.	5.626517734363266
8635. instead	of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional nine	provinces as was usually	done this equated the odd yang numbers	with mountains and the even numbers	with rivers; taking the former	from the five sacred mountains of the han period and the latter from	the principal river systems of old china.	3.2431814888722994
8636. thus the middle	number 5 represented sung-shan in honan central china; the	3 t'ai-shan in shantung east china; the 7 hwa-shan in shensi	west china; the 1 heng-shan in hopei north china	; and the	9 huo-shan in anhwei which was then the south sacred mountain.	4.340195063134371
8637. for the rivers the 4 represented the huai to the southeast;	the 2 the san kiang southwest;	the 8 the chi in the northeast; and the 6 the yellow river	in the northwest.	3.2535610345970336
8638. note that by western standards this	plan was upside down as it put north at the bottom and south	at the top with the other directions correspondingly altered; but in	this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention	for all maps.	4.886174697804212
8639. the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was	equated with the nine provinces; and whenever the lo shu	involved directional symbolism it was oriented in this same fashion.	3.396314159225258
8640. few persons who join the church are insincere.	7.393269843430183
8641. they earnestly desire	to do the will of god.	4.962131372734766
8642. when they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve	christian stature it is an indictment of the church.	6.410521196848748
8643. these	fatalities are dramatic evidence of halfway evangelism a failure	to follow through.	3.5646562425691988
8644. a program of lay visitation evangelism can	end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless	practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active	fellowship.	5.582529670753938
8645. the work of lay visitation evangelism is not	completed when all of the persons on the responsibility list have	been interviewed.	4.0295625470603795
8646. in the average situation about one-third of those visited	make commitments to christ and the church.	5.835787410400501
8647. the pastor and the	membership preparation and assimilation committee must follow	through immediately with a carefully planned program.	3.283703919875743
8648. the first thirty	to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine	their interest and participation in the life of the church.	5.6155879027089
8649. neglect	means spiritual paralysis or death.	4.539147255907186
8650. churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation	and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members	loyal and active.	5.771381780793109
8651. this is the answer to the problem of membership	delinquency.	6.3830064512039195
8652. it is important that persons desiring to	unite with the church be prepared for this experience so that it	may be meaningful and spiritually significant.	5.666380486418628
8653. it is unfair and unchristian	to ask a person to take the sacred vows of church membership	before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications.	3.7031200376685165
8654. preparation for church membership begins immediately after	_ the pastor writes a personal letter	to each individual expressing his joy over the decision assuring	him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time and outlining	the plan for membership preparation classes and membership sunday.	4.478331205825128
8655. some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported	by the visitors.	3.9673634808708247
8656. it should not be postponed later than the next day.	7.845534307160529
8657. _ the pastor	calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance	conference.	3.997788728648878
8658. if possible he should make an appointment in order	that all persons involved may be present.	5.7304306087461345
8659. this is not a social	call.	6.701398293034024
8660. it is definitely a spiritual guidance conference.	7.112487507258798
8661. he	will discuss the significance of christian commitment the necessity	of family religion and private devotions and the importance of the	membership preparation sessions.	3.6419791108239767
8662. there may be problems of conduct or	questions of belief which will require his counsel.	6.1064700172091335
8663. each conference	should be concluded naturally with prayer.	4.5835948913498825
8664. a piece of devotional material	_	a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary	for adults.	5.608485722215283
8665. none should ask less.	6.0132809747053715
8666. those who join the church need to be instructed in the faith and the	meaning of christian discipleship before they take the sacred	vows.	6.4902826852348205
8667. they will have a greater appreciation for the church and a deeper	devotion to it if membership requires something of them.	4.326410492336942
8668. many	churches find the sunday school hour to be the most practical time	for adult preparation classes.	6.231030915182661
8669. others meet on sunday night at the	mid-week service or for a series of four nights.	4.426662685568784
8670. some pastors have	two sessions in one evening with a refreshment period between.	5.899367270978257
8671. the sessions should cover four major areas: - the christian	faith - duties of church	membership - the local church and its program	following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing	with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the	week.	2.990196140978121
8672. this procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership	packet.	6.75211112985991
8673. most pastors find	that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore	hold it on a week night prior to reception sunday.	3.8183131774169508
8674. in this session	the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the	work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the	local church.	5.9831783432828916
8675. the lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak	on the various phases of church life service opportunities the church	school missions men's work women's work youth program social	activities and finances.	3.1443458428951905
8676. the budget of the church may be presented	and pledges solicited at this session.	5.97229540686647
8677. an interest finder or	talent sheet may be filled out by each person.	3.961194614264271
8678. the fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the	church facilities and refreshments.	5.765355456440763
8679. the social time gives an opportunity	for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members.	3.928416276182526
8680. suggestions for membership preparation	in conducting	the membership preparation-inquirers' class the pastor should	plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest	on the part of the class.	5.447887222067949
8681. the following have been found effective.	4.749146343284764
8682. _ extend the number of classes.	8.155948498874775
8683. some churches have	six or more training sessions of two hours each generally held on sunday	night or during the week.	3.5972413340721023
8684. this gives greater opportunity for the	in	_ use	audio-visual aids.	6.6099619294251575
8685. some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion	pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to	_ have a question box.	3.344562647738147
8686. some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly.	6.771927362945864
8687. urge them	_ use a textbook	_ select class members for	_ ask each member	to write a statement on such topics as: what christ means to	me what the church means to me why join the church	_ assign	_ invite	class members to share in an extra period of bible study each	_ ask each new member to bring his pledge of loyalty	to the reception service.	2.963690487502998
8688. there	is a growing conviction among pastors and church leaders that	all those who come into the fellowship of the church need preparatory	training including those coming by transfer of membership.	5.735389072846908
8689. george e	sweazey writes: there is danger in trying to make admission	to the church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know	that anything has happened.	3.529656560900488
8690. people appreciate experiences	that demand something of them.	7.205683402066534
8691. those who transfer their membership are	no exception to the rule.	4.595725996661955
8692. for most of them it will be their first	experience in membership training since this is a recent development	in many churches.	7.382470852629135
8693. those coming from other denominations will welcome	the opportunity to become informed.	4.338004869354196
8694. the preparatory class is	an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted	with one another.	4.7631460841424245
8695. it provides a natural transition into the life	of the local church and its organizations.	4.509129833302174
8696. fellowship	the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo	when the group of new members stands before the congregation to	declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship	of the church.	5.364578131916186
8697. this should be a high moment in their lives a	never-to-be-forgotten	experience.	4.9391511613196215
8698. they should sense the tremendous significance	of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to christ our	lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages.	5.011073603965213
8699. every detail of the service merits careful attention- the	hymns the sermon the ritual the right hand of fellowship the introduction	to the congregation the welcome of the congregation.	3.4946576391599975
8700. this is	a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation.	6.386724954732368
8701. it will help	to determine the attitude of the new members toward the church.	5.836695867082776
8702. it	can mean the difference between participation and inaction spiritual	growth and decay.	6.054274458742315
8703. the worship service is the natural and logical	time to receive new members into the church.	3.403513457204426
8704. the atmosphere for	this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the	worship experience.	4.924557195502126
8705. psychologically the reception should be the	_ ask the new members to meet thirty	minutes before the service to complete talent sheets and pledge	cards.	3.7522955723055302
8706. some denominations ask new members to sign personally the	chronological membership register.	6.371773672860491
8707. provide a name card for each	_ arrange a	reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together.	3.3838584685186683
8708. _ invite sponsors or fellowship	friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service.	6.906577742147353
8709. _	introduce each new member to the congregation asking him to face	_ lead the congregation in a response of	_ have a reception for new members in the parlor or	_ take a picture of	the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the	_ have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with	new members as guests.	3.399951376550016
8710. growth of new members	the church is the family of god.	6.939588248878505
8711. the members of the family are drawn together by a common love	for christ and a sincere devotion to his kingdom.	3.739678590113325
8712. every member	of the family must have a vital place in its life.	7.072110421769898
8713. this is no spectator-type	experience; everyone is to be a participant.	5.974524110980696
8714. yet the	most difficult problem in the church's program of evangelism is right	at this point- helping new members to become participating growing	parts of the fellowship.	5.384079311444695
8715. very easily they may be neglected and eventually	join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive.	4.166001379097529
8716. a study	of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period	revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who	joined the church were lost to the church within seven years.	5.04217920290785
8717. one	denomination had a membership of 1419833 at the beginning of the	period under study and twenty years later its membership stood at 1541991-	a net growth of only 122158.	3.398226329789258
8718. yet during the same period there	were 1080062 additions.	7.6367457959173874
8719. another major church body had 4499608	members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4622444.	3.6445867680401776
8720. during	this time 4122354 new members were brought into the fellowship.	6.531645546269452
8721. still another denomination had 7360187 members twenty years ago.	4.506091018702009
8722. during	this period 7484268 members were received yet the net membership	now is only 9910741.	5.635919343135569
8723. these figures indicate that we are losing	almost as many as we are receiving into membership.	4.705439513691723
8724. this problem	is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the	active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship.	5.66661309823334
8725. studies of membership trends even in some areas where population	is expanding show that numbers of churches have had little net	increase though many new members were received.	3.5454633367484467
8726. something is wrong when	these things happen.	7.39114473793257
8727. the local family of god has failed its	new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare.	3.5389756673496717
8728. new members can become participating growing	members.	8.137013597561044
8729. but this will not happen merely through the natural process	of social life.	4.479944124543875
8730. it must be planned and carefully developed.	8.506278391377
8731. the	entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part	in this dynamic process.	4.076218773524775
8732. if the church has followed the plan	of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership	preparation as outlined earlier in this book the process of assimilation	and growth will be well under way.	5.514759893370458
8733. those who enter the front	door of the church intelligently and with christian dedication will	not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest.	3.793152184461167
8734. however it is not enough to bring persons to christian commitment	and train them in the meaning of christian discipleship.	7.486909995784527
8735. when	they unite with the church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction	of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into	effective christians.	3.569782520077541
8736. the church expects certain things of	those who become members.	5.705354392881351
8737. the new members justifiably expect some things	from their church family:  - welcome into the fellowship	- sincere christian love and understanding  - inspiring	and challenging worship experiences  - social and recreational	activities  - opportunities for christian service	- opportunities for study of the christian faith and the bible	- creative prayer experiences  - guidance in christian	social concerns	men need unity and they need god.	3.0094407553084057
8738. care must be taken neither	to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas	about him but with these two qualifications the statement stands.	5.125330578973721
8739. the statement also points to a classic paradox: the more men turn	toward god who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but	also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established	the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one	another.	3.270840304808609
8740. to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map	and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political	ones with a resultant fragmentation of the human race.	5.358325311544976
8741. massacres	attending the partition of india and the establishment of the state	of israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such	divisions can engender.	3.432435341191151
8742. the words of cardinal newman come forcibly	to	mind: oh how we hate one another for the love of god!	the source of this paradox is not difficult to identify.	4.934159437921394
8743. institutions require structure form and definition	and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion.	3.486213068171733
8744. a completely	amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms; to escape	this fate it must rule some things out.	5.193592720874966
8745. for every criterion which	defines what something is at the same time proclaims- implicitly if	not openly- what that something is not.	3.873975947820837
8746. some persons are so sensitive	to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether;	in the present context this amounts to the advice that while	being religious may have a certain justification we ought to dispense	with churches.	5.101996931952714
8747. man is at once a gregarious	animal and a form-creating being.	5.0051392257242
8748. having once committed himself to	an ideal which he considers worthwhile he inevitably creates forms	for its expression and institutions for its continuance.	5.054760009466301
8749. to propose that	men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing	that they be learned without having schools.	3.4442858315983322
8750. both eventualities	are possible logically but practically they are impossible.	6.302683481344192
8751. as much	as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in god they instrumentally	require the institutions that will direct their steps toward	him.	3.411126651003253
8752. yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men	at odds with their fellows.	6.369844600869885
8753. is there any way out of the predicament?	6.668548243462377
8754. 	the only way that i can see is through communication.	6.320219985908325
8755. interfaith	communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited	upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our	adversaries.	4.038276697559216
8756. approached creatively it is a high art.	8.355483547853265
8757. it is the art	of relating the finite to the infinite of doing our best to insure that	the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not	thwart god's intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary.	3.2062654345771375
8758. in a certain sense interfaith communication parallels diplomatic	communication among the nation-states.	6.366208496071292
8759. what are the pertinent	facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history?	4.205936116169851
8760. 	i shall touch on three areas: personal national and theological.	5.433193905713204
8761. by personal factors i mean those rooted in personality	structure.	4.2227797034845205
8762. some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological	differences at all but by the need of men to have persons they	can blame distrust denounce and even hate.	5.642162535499705
8763. such needs may rise	to pathological proportions.	4.951994427766526
8764. modern psychology has shown that paralleling	the authoritarian personality is the bigoted personality	in which insecurity inferiority suspicion and distrust combine	to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured	if it does not exist naturally.	5.144097285940076
8765. fortunately the number of	pathological bigots appears to be quite small but it would be a mistake	to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the	rest of us.	4.494688483635527
8766. to some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices	attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us.	6.657739419998733
8767. interfaith	conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most	unfortunate of all for they have no redeeming features whatsoever.	3.6251652063665576
8768. it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must	learn to recognize when it is they rather than pretexts for them	that are causing the trouble and do everything possible to nurture the	healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies.	5.7050080094691475
8769. while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith	conflict may be perennial nationalism is more variable.	3.902225098958139
8770. the	specific instance i have in mind is the afro-asian version which	has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century.	5.834809714643086
8771. emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination the	afro-asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires.	3.496179540949924
8772. no less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence	since world war 2 and the number is growing by the year.	6.3701801212442914
8773. as	an obvious consequence obstacles to genuine interfaith communication	have grown more formidable in one important area: relations between	christians and non-christians in these lands.	3.2429917511451207
8774. colonialism alone would	have been able to make these difficulties serious for christianity	is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that	repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation	of the other.	5.099861551417101
8775. actually however this turns out to be only part of	the picture.	4.938537137518797
8776. nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign	religions but the revival of native ones some of which had been lying	in slumber for centuries.	5.432466250703258
8777. the truth is that any revival of traditional	and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity	and volksgeist which these young nations very much need.	3.2483926347792758
8778. insofar	as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life	which constitute ultimate trans-political justifications for their existence	such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which	these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else's.	4.60018271481847
8779. all this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural	communication for which christian missions stand.	4.378137107884132
8780. africans and asians	tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have	produced as centers and agents of western culture and ideology if not	of direct political propaganda.	4.6961561848842654
8781. the people hardest hit by this suspicion	are of course christians on the mainland of china.	3.6369029719829715
8782. but the	problem extends elsewhere.	8.068891221815447
8783. for example in burma and ceylon many buddhists	argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion.	4.391763405593817
8784. in 1960 ceylon nationalized its sectarian- preponderantly christian-	schools to the rejoicing of most of its 7000000 buddhists and	the lament of its 800000 roman catholics.	5.05181639122711
8785. again india has imposed	formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries	and fanatical hindu parties are expected to seek further action against	christians once the influence making for tolerance due to nehru	and his followers is gone.	3.270697391067363
8786. the progressive closing of afro-asian	ears to the christian message is epitomized in a conversation	i had three years ago while flying from jerusalem to cairo.	4.922786027550231
8787. i was	seated next to the director of the seventh day adventists' world	radio program.	4.687329329021017
8788. he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable	number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio	networks but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them.	5.737250863185406
8789. after returning to the united states and raising the money he	discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available.	4.132794904804596
8790. it was not that they had been contracted for during the interval;	they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes.	6.215771714819382
8791. it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost	vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures	and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this	heightening of anti-christian sentiment.	3.4046747698601365
8792. ironically these are the	groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since	world war 2 while the more established denominations are barely	maintaining pre-war staffs.	4.65983487554664
8793. although i have emphasized the	barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between	christians and non-christians in asia the fact is that this development	has also widened the gulf between certain afro-asian religions	themselves.	3.4730310369825514
8794. the partition of india has hardly improved relations	between hindus and muslims; neither has the establishment of the	state of israel fostered harmony between muslims and jews.	4.591315263635998
8795. i turn finally to several theological developments.	4.530342211830119
8796. the modern world has been marked by progressive	disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state whatever	its political form.	5.3570658938573565
8797. the american constitution was historic at	this point in providing that congress shall make no law respecting	an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.	3.151493625225732
8798. one of our foremost jurists david dudley field has gone so	far as to call this provision the greatest achievement ever made in	the course of human history.	5.208530286855261
8799. the trend throughout the world's	religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical	validity of this constitutional enactment.	3.569955541545874
8800. pakistan was created in	1947 expressly as a muslim state but when the army took over eleven	years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed	in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think	their way through to the meaning of islam for the modern political	situation.	4.9035467341929655
8801. what is the point charles adams reports the pakistanis	as asking in demanding an islamic state and society if no	one not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves can say clearly	and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is?	3.6770329521133154
8802. 	the current regime of president mohammad ayub khan is determinedly	secular.	5.264131703916697
8803. and while the nation was formerly named the islamic	republic of pakistan it is now simply the republic of pakistan.	4.028214341723136
8804. comparable trends can be noted elsewhere.	6.83138085202567
8805. the new regime	in turkey is intentionally less muslim than its predecessor.	3.620951910373222
8806. the	religious parties in israel have experienced a great loss of prestige	in recent months.	5.456366414261198
8807. during the years when israel was passing from	crisis to crisis- the sinai campaign the infusion of multitudes of	penniless immigrants- it was felt that the purpose of national unity	could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious	parties.	3.2540476554667115
8808. now that israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction	of tensions the secularists are less disposed to compromise.	5.440433559005437
8809. and in this country gustave weigel's delineation of the line between	the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign	served to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the	practical autonomy of both church and state.	3.6690489979717533
8810. the failure at that time	of the puerto rican bishops to control the votes of their people added	a ring of good sense to father weigel's theological argument.	4.823851232402965
8811. everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that	governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible-	in a word too human- to warrant any claim of maintaining	partnership with the divine.	3.7551953755079506
8812. my	father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded	to student volunteer movement speakers who held watches in their hands	and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese	souls were going to hell each second because these students were not	over there saving them.	4.436991055195387
8813. that mention of this should bring smiles to	our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent	to which attitudes have changed.	3.4757460116079453
8814. i do not mean to imply that christians	have adopted the liberal assumption so prevalent in hinduism	that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit.	5.260024589865025
8815. leslie	newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the world council	of churches when he says we must claim absoluteness and finality	for christ and his finished work but that very claim forbids	us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it.	3.31579566813734
8816. newbiggin's qualification on the christian claim is of considerable	significance.	6.122587045189375
8817. the roman catholic church has excommunicated one of	its priests father feeney for insisting that there is no salvation	outside the visible church.	3.4979798686391765
8818. in mentioning this under salvation	reconsidered i do not mean to imply that roman catholic doctrine	has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the	world community what that doctrine is.	5.4207614078712805
8819. when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to permit	the termination of the human race by human action because	there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify	such a thing they know exactly what they mean.	3.5612591131771603
8820. of course in prudential	calculation in balancing the good directly intended and done against	the evil unintended and indirectly done no greater precision can	be forthcoming than the subject allows.	5.014212235563569
8821. yet it seems clear that there	can be no good sufficiently great or evil repelled sufficiently grave	to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action.	3.5503861798593124
8822. i mean however that the moral theologian knows what he means by permit.	6.5511804521597155
8823. he is not talking in the main about probabilities risks	and danger in general.	4.30941513982152
8824. he is talking about an action which just as efficaciously	does an evil thing	as it efficaciously does some good.	5.597036637602382
8825. he	is talking about double effects of which the specific action causes	directly the one and indirectly the other but causes both;	of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended	or not directly intended but still both are done while the	evil effect is with equal consciousness on the part of the agent foreknown	to be among the consequences.	3.2807316177655834
8826. this is what in a technical sense	to only permit an evil result means.	6.393070605987803
8827. it means to do it	and to know one is doing it but as only a secondary if certain effect	of the good one primarily does and intends.	3.7224483283591994
8828. of course grave guiltiness	may be imputed to the military action of any nation or to the action	of any leader or leaders which for any supposed good permits	in this sense the termination of the human race by human action.	5.137557627857296
8829. certainly in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives	it is never possible that no world would be preferable to	some worlds and there are in truth no circumstances in which the	destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative.	3.450707466617066
8830. naturally where one or the other of the effects of an action	is uncertain this has to be taken into account.	7.24409497609562
8831. especially is this	true when because the good effect is remote and speculative while	the evil is certain and grave the action is prohibited.	3.547159999996778
8832. presumably	if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the	evil result that may be forthcoming not only must the good and the	evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate but also calculation	of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty	in the good or evil effect must be taken into account.	5.065907783721863
8833. there must	not only be greater good than evil objectively in view but also greater	probability of actually doing more good than harm.	3.5329028044174717
8834. if an evil which	is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for	by a problematic speculative future good by the same token not every	present certain and immediate good that may have	to be done will be outweighed by a problematic speculative and future	evil.	4.6759537448410455
8835. nevertheless according to the traditional theory a man begins	in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate cosequences	before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences.	3.647447032740881
8836. he does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences	of his action.	6.8113466820181765
8837. above all he does not debate mere contingencies	and therefore if these are possibly dreadful find himself forced	into inaction.	3.9131476282023216
8838. he does what he can and may and must without regarding	himself as lord of the future or on the other hand as covered with	guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not	permit in the sense explained.	5.566630151038549
8839. by contrast a good deal of nuclear	pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities and	not with the moral nature of the action to be done; and by deriving	legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly	or probably result whether by anyone's doing or by accident	it finds itself driven to inaction to non-political action in politics	and non-military action in military affairs and to the not very surprising	discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense	of justice can possibly be based.	3.263306065481751
8840. mr philip toynbee	writes for example that in terms of probability it is surely as	likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near	future if the present situation continues.	5.500045648032347
8841. if it continues indefinitely	it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will	be made and that the devastation will begin.	4.124018771691099
8842. against such a termination	of human life on earth by human action he then proposes as an	alternative that we negotiate at once with the russians and get the	best terms which are available that we deliberately negotiate	from comparative weakness.	5.111006578503266
8843. he bravely attempts to face this alternative	realistically ie by considering the worst possible outcome	namely the total domination of the world by russia within a few	years.	3.5971459523264637
8844. this would be by far the better choice when it is a question	of allowing the human race to survive possibly under the domination	of a regime which most of us detest or of allowing it to	destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish.	5.597730616548977
8845. nevertheless the	consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified:	it is a possible result however improbable; the worst and	least probable result; if it didn't prevail mankind would	still be given the opportunity of prevailing; for surely	anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility	of nuclear war.	3.1974676726793816
8846. if we have not thought and made a decision entirely	in these terms then we need to submit ourselves to the following	simple test: have we decided how we are to kill the other	members of our household in the event of our being less injured than	they are?	5.426986740972607
8847.  thus moral decision must be entirely deduced backward	from the likely eventuality; it is no longer to be formulated in terms	of the nature of present action itself its intention and proximate	effect or the thing to be done.	3.7197121621291487
8848. several of the replies	to mr toynbee without conscious resort to the traditional terminology	with regard to the permission of evil succeed in restoring the	actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be	made by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in	danger of this evil.	4.693961092463189
8849. it is worse for a nation to give in to evil	h than to run the risk of annihilation.	4.096987987335875
8850. i am consciously prepared	to run the continued risk of 'race suicide by accident' rather	than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design.	4.987491783734132
8851. but	i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need	not increase but may be deliberately reduced by precautions against	accidents or by limiting war?	3.5652123365402333
8852.  quoting mr kennan's	phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably	to nuclear war he toynbee says that anything is better than a	policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war.	5.211696688308274
8853. if	asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility	most men will choose the latter.	3.609148297075407
8854. if h philip toynbee	is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk	of nuclear war i think he is right.	5.3940019814661815
8855. i do not accept that the choice	is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war.	4.153523496590174
8856. even	professor arnold toynbee agreeing with his son does so in these	terms: compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of	the destruction of the human race all other evils are lesser evils h.	4.985453938697355
8857. let us therefore put first things first and make sure of preserving	the human race at whatever the temporary price may be.	3.6222861303551412
8858. mr	philip toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the	anticipations of orwell in nineteen eighty-four if he believed	communism was not only evil but also irredeemably evil then	he might think it right to do anything rather than to take the	risk of a communist world.	5.065490811758516
8859. even a nuclear holocaust is a little less	frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the	earth until doomsday.	3.8721407628388795
8860. no political order or economic system is	so clearly contrary to nature.	5.89027920378574
8861. but one does not have to affirm the existence	of an evil order irredeemable in that sense or a static order	in which no changes will take place in time to be able truthfully to	affirm the following fact: there has never been justitia imprinted	in social institutions and social relationships except in the context	of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force.	3.451305234033413
8862. on their	way to the heavenly city the children of god make use of the pax-ordo	of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility	for its preservation.	5.613367631299491
8863. not to repel injury and uphold and improve	pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice	that challenges it at the moment but also to start down the steep	slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand.	3.531465951616201
8864. toynbee	seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social	embodiment.	7.737486115124565
8865. i would far rather die after a russian occupation of	this country- by some deliberate act of refusal- than die uselessly	by atomisation.	3.4039405013714923
8866. would such an act of refusal be useful?	8.4461715996265
8867.  he does	not mean in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the	proposition that if we took the risk of surrendering a new generation	in britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order	to reverse the consequences of that surrender.	3.3040320409649144
8868. he wants to be	brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless-	far far more hopeless than was the hungarian revolution of 1956.	5.345481147537813
8869. this is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war by	creating a monopoly in one power of the world's arsenal of unlimited	weapons.	3.7925131611952128
8870. it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other	than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it or preconditioned	more positive means for attaining it in the past.	5.309942931212089
8871. it is	no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso	that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance	by occupied peoples.	3.5069599897655004
8872. hope for the future h would lie in the	natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop.	6.327734373949311
8873. this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted	to the very last; it is to stride along the steep slope downward.	3.709036576135871
8874. the only contrary action in the future as in the past runs the	risk of war; and now and in the future unlike in the past any	attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment	of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear	warfare and the danger that an effect of it will by human action render	this planet less habitable by the human race.	5.490254648476008
8875. that is why it is	so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision	as to permitted effects and not draw back in fright from	any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities	or probabilities unrelated or not directly morally related	to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures.	3.3235931082439927
8876. finally just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful	analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end	of human life on this earth but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination	the same thing must be said in connection with the question	of what we may perhaps already be doing by human action to accelerate	this end.	4.997951051316675
8877. we should not allow the image of an immanent end brought	about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle	for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that	in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence	among others of many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know	not what future.	3.5286679011968256
8878. much more than shelter housing symbolizes social status	a sense of belonging acceptance within a given group or neighborhood	identification with particular cultural values and social institutions	feelings of pride and worth aspirations and hopes basic to	human well-being.	4.751418649039002
8879. for almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination	in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow	upon these values assumed as self-evident by most americans.	3.546676447883375
8880. few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure	to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders.	5.504787090323922
8881. this pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying	their professional ethics; it has sought new sympathy for the human	aspirations of racial minority groups in this country.	3.3504772415576105
8882. it is not surprising	that as spokesman for real estate interests the national association	of real estate boards and its local associations	have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure.	5.202059663517284
8883. how does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing	restrictions based on race religion or ethnic attachment?	3.945053709136975
8884.  what	does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest?	7.114969831722864
8885.  what	ought to be what is his potential role as a force for constructive social	change?	3.734216208208783
8886.  what social ethical and theological insights can the	church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation?	5.588075178169195
8887. 	recently a group of the faculty at wesleyan university's public	affairs center sought some answers to these questions.	3.6907999386143366
8888. several	new england realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium	of property lawyers political scientists economists social psychologists	social ethicists and theologians.	4.7403484153382225
8889. here in an atmosphere	of forthrightness and mutual criticism each sought to bring his particular	insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing	and the part each man present played in it.	3.667347300954405
8890. for a number of years	wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business	leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty	and student body attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their	responsibility for public policy.	5.187708899753394
8891. this article presents our observations	of that session of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the	faculty and students saw them.	3.8248365793312704
8892. such conversation quickly reveals	an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most	realtors.	5.599595500776292
8893. within the membership of this group as has been found true	of men in other professional or trade associations the most ready	portrayal of oneself to the public is that of a neutral agent simply	serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between	them.	3.886490672950278
8894. professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving	the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner.	5.337086767046311
8895. but as	conversation goes on particularly among the realtors themselves another	image emerges that of considerable power and influence in the community.	3.5643168807014547
8896. obviously much more than customer expectation is determining	the realtor's role.	6.746873433501745
8897. judgments are continually rendered regarding	the potential buyers' income educational level and above all racial	extraction; and whether these would qualify them for congenial	happy relations to other people in certain community areas.	3.105890401350091
8898. how explicit such factors have been	historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases	or in a review of nareb's code of ethics article 34 in	the code adopted in 1924 states that a realtor should never be	instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property	or occupancy members of any race or nationality or any individuals	whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that	neighborhood.	4.349424065304137
8899. though the reference to race was stricken by the association	in 1950 being an agent of such detrimental influences	still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to	avoid.	3.32936873583394
8900. the rationale for this avoidance was most frequently	expressed in economic terms; all feared the supposed stigma they believed	would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white	particularly negro peoples into all-white restricted areas.	4.073395070888702
8901. they would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real	estate professionals but agitators for some kind of cause	or reform and this was no longer to be a pro.	3.947254577564608
8902. obviously	what we are confronted with here is the identification of professional	with narrow skills and specialization the effective servicing	of a client rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper	meaning and associations of one's work.	4.648141314569856
8903. these men- for the most	part educated in our best new england colleges well established	financially and socially in the community- under kindly but insistent	probing reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data	for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the	people they claim to serve or about the public responses that actually	follow their occasional breach of a client-service relationship.	2.9330816345686785
8904. this narrow professionalism does not even fit the present	realities of their situation as the pressure of minorities and the	power and respectability of the realtors increase.	5.116597761015771
8905. as our discussion	continued the inadequacy of the client relationship as an interpretation	of their way of operating became evident.	3.89167040833308
8906. realtors	live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work as	members of social and professional organizations as citizens and civic	leaders as church laymen as university alumni as newspaper readers	etc.	4.841143336250278
8907. from such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that	shapes his moral understanding.	3.8135693332805745
8908. it seems to us that choices exercised	by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas:	the various ways in which they interpret a particular social	issue; their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political	processes; and most pervasively their interpretation of	who is a real pro of what it means to be a professional man in	a technical fragmented society.	5.109218021392797
8909. most of the realtors minimized	their own understanding of and role in the racial issue pleading	that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society.	3.8684218232765817
8910. there is some reality to this; the commission on race and housing	concluded that there is no reason to believe that real estate	men are either more or less racially prejudiced on the whole than any	other segment of the american population.	6.0246825428234345
8911. but such a reaction obscures	the powerful efforts made in the past by both nareb and	its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices.	3.8118931394139723
8912. also it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment	continually employed.	7.104716599156644
8913. like business and university groups generally	these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and	psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions	they make.	3.2920018010616237
8914. realtors both generally and in this group have invariably	equated residential integration with a decline in property values	a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension.	5.09100798307287
8915. recent	studies by the commission on race and housing and others however	point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion.	3.4634761203434454
8916. there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated	residentially without great loss of property values the white population	having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation	of the negroes' desire for well-kept housing privacy etc.	4.954142926027624
8917. data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial	group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property	values before the group comes in.	4.08587278564322
8918. often they are able to get in	only because the area is declining economically.	7.119448387267294
8919. significantly	no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of	the six volumes	that present the commission's findings.	3.5854648836378034
8920. no one anticipates any radical	shift in this situation but questions concerning reading habits	the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must	surely be raised.	5.341727005599083
8921. the role of both church and university as sources	of information and settings within which the implications of such information	may be explored needs consideration.	3.434643778257704
8922. relevant facts	however	extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance	of harmonious neighborhoods.	5.67370280199071
8923. discussion of minority housing necessarily	involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic	conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity	the function and limitations of government in the securing of such	equality and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents	of racial agitation and strife.	2.842649340032854
8924. realtors realize of course that they are involved in an	increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities	for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities	for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination	in housing.	5.382237614355135
8925. on the positive side recent federal action has largely	undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position;	anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted	by thirteen states and while specific provisions have varied the	tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage.	3.12321723839955
8926. realtors in attendance	at the colloquium expressed interest for example in connecticut's	new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would	like to have to obey but in support of which none had been willing	to go on public record.	5.12196367737665
8927. as far as they were aware the connecticut	association of real estate boards had not officially opposed	the bill's passage or lobbied in its support.	3.865518319183657
8928. in 1957 the real estate boards of new york city	actively opposed the then pending private housing anti-discrimination	law.	6.087957052690838
8929. official reasoning: the bill was a wanton invasion	there are sins of omission as	well as commission; the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations	either negative or positive plays a large part in the public	acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively	enforced.	3.4466110191044774
8930. judicial opinion since the supreme court decision	on shelley v kraemer has rendered racial restrictive	covenants unenforcible.	5.242503448420276
8931. such a decision should have placed a powerful	weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry but there is little	evidence that realtors or at least their associations have repudiated	the principle in such clauses.	3.952705140857009
8932. in the states that have passed	laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing	support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage	through additional legislation could help remove the label of social	reformism that most realtors individually seem determined to	avoid.	4.7560967081168855
8933. but as yet no real estate board has been willing officially	to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority	buyers into all-white neighborhoods.	3.357539046400965
8934. one of the roles of	the social scientist ethicist or theologian in our discussions with	the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities	offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise	of broad social responsibilities in their work.	4.8480925124068435
8935. but responsiveness to	these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human	good and not simply as a professional white american good.	3.8159446712996186
8936. such	judgments are meaningful only	in so far as persons are members of a world	let us say a community that embraces scarsdale or yonkers but is	also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive.	5.101959911507364
8937. that community	of all creation is then the ultimate object of our loyalty and	the concrete norm of all moral judgment.	3.6135197889969466
8938. racial discrimination is wrong	then not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying	to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the	grain of creation and against the will of the creator.	5.323502372450237
8939. thus moral issues	concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take	on theological dimensions.	4.675780657249995
8940. over the years	individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable	unity in the methods and practices employed.	6.426734241177913
8941. most realtors and	real estate brokers talk of themselves as professional people	with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions.	3.7945575194900907
8942. but what significance attaches to professional beyond the narrow	sense of skillfulness in meeting a client's stated needs as already	noted?	5.052404293463117
8943.  our faculty and students pressed this issue more than	any other.	4.070579824568804
8944. as a theologian in the group pointed out a professional	was before the modern period of technical specialization one who	professed to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use	of his particular skills.	5.684214215457209
8945. if we look about the world today we can see clearly that there	are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization:	science and religion.	3.8139897388469137
8946. science is placing in our	hands the ultimate power of the universe the power of the atom.	7.386175556497168
8947. religion	or the lack of it will decide whether we use this power to build	a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind or whether	we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed.	3.6652856114438648
8948. how can we	have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge?	6.7935145623591655
8949.    we	may feel pessimistic at the outlook.	4.654206845190143
8950. and yet there is a note of	hope	because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is	also giving us atomic vision.	6.639744343327545
8951. we are looking inside the atom and seeing	there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material	a universe that in a word is not matter but music.	3.8387651733060983
8952. and it is	in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration	of our faith.	6.068759448518473
8953. to see this vision in perspective	we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new	power from the atom.	4.0542210354127795
8954. you know that i could hold right here in my	hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb	that dropped on hiroshima.	6.258875016141192
8955. it was only about the size of a baseball;	but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of	20000 tons of tnt.	4.096123954844501
8956. that is enough tnt to fill the tower	of the empire state building; and with the availability of bombs	of that size war became a new problem.	5.642966083226625
8957. now we might have restricted	the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium	because it is found in only a few places in the world.	4.10163480726329
8958. but we had hardly	started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we	were faced with the hydrogen bomb.	5.817241881520589
8959. hydrogen is just as plentiful as	uranium is scarce.	4.441432232078693
8960. we know that we have hydrogen in water; water is	f and the h stands for hydrogen; there is also hydrogen in wood	and hydrogen in our bodies.	5.559119899374723
8961. i have calculated that if i could snap	my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen	in my body i would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of	the kind that fell on hiroshima.	3.864998797933436
8962. i won't try the experiment but	i think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let	ourselves go there would be quite an explosion.	5.761952626371995
8963. and then think how	little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in delaware	bay or in the ocean beyond.	4.386408014567903
8964. salt water is still f the same hydrogen	is there.	6.536080705346037
8965. and the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the	destructive power we hold in our hands today.	4.1833687719167125
8966. of course there	is also an optimistic side to the picture.	6.593430300529203
8967. for if i knew the secret	of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity	i could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power	in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories	in the entire united states for some days.	3.4684522145916983
8968. and think if we all knew	this secret and we could pool our power what a wonderful public utility	company we would make.	5.376427802898861
8969. with just the hydrogen of our bodies we	could run the world for years.	4.441447638804175
8970. then think of delaware bay and the	ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years	to come.	6.110501843634003
8971. it is power with which we can literally rebuild the world	provide adequate housing food education abundant living for everyone	everywhere.	3.4779281493121323
8972. now let us see where this power	comes from.	6.648895371265029
8973. to grasp our new view of the atom we have to appreciate	first of all how small the atom is.	4.363709846017639
8974. i have been trying to make this	clear to my own class in chemistry.	6.756806607773916
8975. one night there were some dried	peas lying on our kitchen table and these peas looked to me like a little	group of atoms; and i asked myself a question: suppose i	had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body how large an	area would they cover?	3.312600557560231
8976.    i calculated first that there are	about an octillion atoms in the average human body; that is a figure	one with 27 ciphers quite a large number.	5.368524663042383
8977. then i calculated that a	million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator; a billion	peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic; a trillion peas	would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people;	and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia.	3.3899085787550405
8978. i saw that i would soon run out of buildings at	this rate so i decided to take another measure- the whole state of	pennsylvania.	5.657357604983391
8979. imagine that there is a blizzard over pennsylvania	but instead of snowing snow it snows peas; so we get the whole state	covered with peas about four feet deep.	3.6748191927758773
8980. you can imagine what it would	look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against	the houses and covering the cars; pennsylvania thus blanketed would	contain about a quintillion peas.	5.071160721183453
8981. but we still have a long	way to go.	5.223165614842378
8982. next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas	of the entire globe- north america south america europe asia	and africa all covered with peas four feet deep; then we have	sextillion peas.	4.797574135158381
8983. next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole	earth with peas then we go out among the neighboring stars collect	250 planets each the size of the earth and also cover each of these	with peas four feet deep; and then we have septillion.	3.5681039431271784
8984. finally we	go into the farthest reaches of the milky way; we get 250000 planets;	we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last	we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body.	4.836945602707771
8985. so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are.	4.5510373075499855
8986. speck- and space	now although an atom is small we can still in	imagination have a look at it.	5.5150435725147995
8987. let us focus on an atom of calcium from	the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that i swallow	a magic alice in wonderland growing pill.	3.5770063095030658
8988. i start growing rapidly	and this calcium atom grows along with me.	5.695100819706404
8989. i shoot up through the	roof into the sky past the clouds through the stratosphere out beyond	the moon out among the planets until i am over a hundred and	fifty million miles long.	3.263368847612028
8990. then this atom of calcium will swell to something	like a great balloon a hundred yards across a balloon big enough	to put a football field inside.	5.146361031279346
8991. and if you should step inside of such	a magnified atom according to the physics of forty years ago you	would see circulating over your head down at the sides and under your	feet some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs.	3.6377609690474015
8992. these	balls are moving in great circles and ellipses and are of course the	electrons the particles of negative electricity which by their action	create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring	atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone.	4.664763033977466
8993. since these electrons are moving like planets you may wonder whether	there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom.	4.05946472227831
8994. so you look down	there and you see a tiny whirling point about the size of the head	of a pin.	6.682420406028676
8995. this is the atomic sun the atomic nucleus.	5.005368701538828
8996. even if the	atom were big enough to hold a football field this nucleus is still	only about the size of a pinhead.	6.393131527370121
8997. it is this atomic nucleus that contains	the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged	electrons in their orbits; it also contains nearly all the mass	and the atomic energy.	3.3226326053495465
8998. you may ask what else there is and the	answer is nothing- nothing but empty space.	6.097697215660795
8999. and since you are made	of atoms you are nothing much but empty space too.	3.9393891070901406
9000. if i could put	your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down squeeze	these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge	you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole	was gone you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you	could see on this piece of paper.	5.214026530083212
9001. someone has remarked that this is	certainly the ultimate in reducing.	4.243034002932259
9002. at any rate it shows us how immaterial	we are.	7.18395234884346
9003. now this 1920 view of the	atom was on the whole a discouraging picture.	4.58218209373365
9004. for we believed that the	electrons	obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics; and therefore	the atom was really just a little machine; and in mechanics the	whole is no more than the sum of the parts.	5.593217334319528
9005. so if you are made of	atoms you are just a big machine; and since the universe is also made	of atoms it is just a supermachine.	4.236858926724296
9006. and this would mean that we	live in a mechanistic universe governed by the laws of cause and effect	bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely	predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit	or human freedom.	5.276686349010678
9007. and this is why so many scientists a half a century	ago were agnostics or atheists.	4.322213579904499
9008. then came the scientific revolution	in the late 1920's.	7.134165010713923
9009. a suggestion from louis de broglie a	physicist in france showed us that these electrons are not point particles	but waves.	3.282824872530951
9010. and to see the meaning of this new picture imagine	that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom	and have a look at it in the way we view it today.	6.722878808394863
9011. now as you step	inside instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets you	see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface	of a pond when you drop a stone into it.	3.338550648586956
9012. these ripples spread	out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral.	5.733217260092315
9013. and as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from	the neighboring atoms you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear	music.	3.936421989383851
9014. it is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra	playing a symphony.	5.836234596249479
9015. harmony melody counterpoint symphonic structure	are there; and as this music ebbs and flows there is an antiphonal	chorus from all the atoms outside in fact from the atoms of	the entire universe.	3.349163965516239
9016. and so today when we examine the structure of our	knowledge of the atom and of the universe we are forced to conclude	that the best word to describe our universe is music.	6.056564604750608
9017. the island of nantucket part of the state of massachusetts	lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother state.	4.24054817115986
9018. some of	the island is sand and is not suitable for living.	6.614701691099046
9019. the island folk	have their living almost entirely from summer visitors; the rest is	obtained from harbor scallops.	3.1271447011515106
9020. during about three and a half months	of the year in the summer there are three boats that run from the mainland	to the island carrying passengers food and cars; but the	rest of the year only one boat is needed which ties up at the mainland	nights and makes the trip down to nantucket in the daytime.	5.523588393515112
9021. this	is a fine trip too on a good day.	4.866744081989475
9022. with martha's vineyard on one	side and the open sea on the other it makes an excellent trip of about	three hours.	5.818269363620084
9023. to what extent and in what ways did christianity affect	the united states of america in the nineteenth century?	4.3743673875757
9024.  how far	and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging	in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age?	5.542781983188159
9025.  to what	extent did it mould the morals and the social economic and political	life and institutions of the country?	3.912844509033446
9026.    a complete picture is	impossible- partly because of the limitations of space partly because	for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the christian	faith data are unobtainable.	5.221698887257819
9027. even more of an obstacle is the difficulty	of separating the influence of christianity from other factors.	4.273872406560835
9028. although a complete picture cannot be given we can indicate	some aspects of life into which the christian faith entered as at	least one creative factor.	5.810298826770492
9029. at times we can say that it was the major	factor.	6.668766486511722
9030. what in some ways was the most important aspect was the	impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation.	6.3211785382123455
9031. as	we have seen a growing proportion although in 1914 still a minority	were members of churches.	3.6636289996537243
9032. presumably those who did not have a formal	church connexion had also felt the influence of christianity to a greater	or less extent.	5.896898079024392
9033. many of them had once been members of a church	or at least had been given instruction in christianity but for one or	another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse.	3.8262401408073274
9034. the form of christianity	to which they were exposed was for some the protestantism of	the older stock for others the protestantism of the nineteenth-century	immigration; for still others mostly of the nineteenth-century	immigration it was roman catholicism and for a small minority it was	eastern orthodoxy.	4.980204538299815
9035. upon all of them played the intellectual social	political and economic attitudes institutions and customs of the	nation.	4.0568078253667625
9036. upon most of these christianity had left an impress and through	them had had a share in making the individual what he was.	5.937394397700776
9037. yet	to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual	showed the effects of christianity would be impossible.	3.712056976292074
9038. at	best only an approximation could be arrived at.	5.990913012755567
9039. to generalize for the	entire nation would be absurd.	4.5970872637003115
9040. for instance we cannot know whether	even for church members the degree of conformity to christian standards	of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members	in the population rose.	5.1394705820425015
9041. the temptation is to say that as the percentage	of church members mounted the degree of discipline exercised	by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general	level.	3.4661072401742796
9042. yet this cannot be proved.	8.794206041909641
9043. we know that in the early part	of the century many protestant congregations took positive action	against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority	subscribed.	4.1158299482336504
9044. thus baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance	of charges against their members of drunkenness fighting malicious	gossip lying cheating sexual irregularities gambling horse racing	and failure to pay just debts.	4.634312066244135
9045. if guilty the offender might be excluded	from membership.	4.413175576135157
9046. as church membership burgeoned such measures	faded into desuetude.	6.532619759430031
9047. but whether this was accompanied by a general	lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know.	4.690980920349905
9048. what	we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point	out the manner in which christianity entered into particular aspects	of the life of the nation.	5.192655627076794
9049. we have already hinted at the fashion in	which christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life.	4.094014137141277
9050. we will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals	of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain	those ideals through reform movements through programmes for bringing	the collective life to the nation to conformity to christian standards	and through leaders in the government.	5.644504246658879
9051. throughout the	nineteenth century christianity exerted its influence on american	society as a whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock.	3.864343313877749
9052. by the end of the century the roman catholic church was beginning	to make itself felt mainly through such institutions as hospitals	but also through its attitude towards organized labour.	5.6681062341997155
9053. in the twentieth	century its influence grew as did that of the protestantism of	the nineteenth-century immigration.	4.190767005662243
9054. the ideals	of the country were deeply indebted to the protestantism of the	older stock.	5.392326526371498
9055. thus america the most widely sung of the patriotic	songs was written by a new england baptist clergyman samuel francis	smith while a student in andover theological	seminary.	3.6154497873378486
9056. with its zeal for liberty and its dependence on god it	breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the evangelical revivals.	5.773803636911873
9057. the great seal of the united states was obviously inspired by	the christian faith.	4.5762399334717765
9058. here was what was called the american dream namely	the effort to build a structure which would be something new in	history and to do so in such fashion that god could bless it.	6.107870271848775
9059. later	in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of katherine	lee bates daughter and granddaughter of new england	congregational ministers in her widely sung hymn written in	1893 america the beautiful with the words o beautiful	for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom	beat across the wilderness.	2.9413188487135455
9060. america america god mend	thy every flaw confirm thy soul in self control thy liberty in law	h.	5.165961192160646
9061. o beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine	alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears.	3.5995426633056025
9062. america america	god shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood from	sea to shining sea.	5.051781093731932
9063. the american dream was compounded of	many strains.	4.5335697526019025
9064. some were clearly of christian origin among them the	great awakening and other revivals which helped to make christian	liberty christian equality and christian fraternity the passion of	the land.	4.737063947800106
9065. some have seen revivalism and the search for christian perfection	as the fountain-head of the american hope.	4.426909832019815
9066. here too must	be placed unitarianism and less obviously from christian inspiration	emerson transcendentalism and the idealism of walt whitman.	5.186711270952466
9067. we	must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of	myth- among them melville hawthorne and henry james the elder	all of them out of a christian background.	3.65894205224539
9068. with	such a dream arising at least in part from the protestant heritage	of the united states and built into the foundations of the nation	it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete	expression.	5.526494538161941
9069. a number were in the nature of movements to relieve or	remove social ills.	4.812908360781094
9070. significantly the initiation and leadership	of a major proportion of the reform movements especially those in	the first half of the nineteenth century came from men and women of	new england birth or parentage and from either trinitarian or unitarian	congregationalism.	5.110470454816246
9071. several of the movements were given a marked	impetus by revivalism.	4.600949183253204
9072. quakers some from new england had a larger	share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted.	5.16102864858669
9073. we do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of new england	ancestry also issued the church of jesus christ of latter	day saints the seventh day adventists christian science the	american board of commissioners for foreign missions the american	home missionary society the american bible society and new	england theology.	3.5021811592874097
9074. the atmosphere was one of optimism of confidence	in human progress and of a determination to rid the world of its ills.	5.663311846816423
9075. the hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence although holding	to original sin and the doctrine of election inspired its adherents	to heroic endeavours for others looked for the early coming of the	millennium and was paralleled by the confidence in man's ability	cherished by the unitarians emerson and the transcendentalists.	2.8872597182831754
9076. we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind	which arose from the kindred evangelicalism of the british isles	and the pietism of the continent of europe- among them prison	reform anti-slavery measures legislation for the alleviation of conditions	of labour the inner mission and the red cross.	4.989608457286198
9077. we	cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation	of collective ills.	3.7844059446659277
9078. a few of the more prominent must serve	as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose.	6.1334331776707485
9079. several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the	century.	5.048708099522321
9080. some disappeared with the attainment	of their purpose.	6.802867475258417
9081. still others sprang up late in the century to meet	conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age.	3.8513794506074817
9082. anti-slavery movement	the movement to end negro slavery began	before 1815 and mounted after that year until as a result of the civil	war emancipation was achieved.	5.282725635788271
9083. long before 1815 the christian	conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act	accordingly.	3.737799652415107
9084. for example in 1693 the philadelphia yearly meeting	of friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves	and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not	comply.	4.885584950055791
9085. in the latter year samuel hopkins from whom the hopkinsian	strain of new england theology took its name asked the continental	congress to abolish slavery.	3.542858999649633
9086. as we have seen methodism early took	a stand against slavery.	7.002702045774841
9087. beginning at least as far back as 1789 various	baptist bodies condemned slavery.	4.205222563678785
9088. after 1815 anti-slavery	sentiment mounted chiefly among protestants and those of protestant	background of the older stock.	6.065893259457422
9089. the nineteenth-century immigration	whether protestant or roman catholic was not so much concerned	for very few if any among them held slaves: they were mostly in the	northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out	or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves.	3.2867230755040975
9090. the anti-slavery movement	took many forms.	5.509976713481443
9091. benjamin lundy a quaker was	a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies.	3.9354948536472
9092. it was	he who turned the attention of william lloyd garrison	to the subject.	6.1618260034931165
9093. garrison massachusetts born of nova scotian parentage	was by temperament and conviction a reformer.	3.3917148076699317
9094. chiefly remembered	because of his incessant advocacy of immediate and unconditional	abolition he also espoused a great variety of other causes- among	them women's rights prohibition and justice to the indians.	4.604888505592632
9095. incurably	optimistic dogmatic and utterly fearless in his youth a devout	baptist in spite of his friendship for the quaker poet john	greenleaf whittier he eventually attacked the orthodox	churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery	issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox	and denied the plenary inspiration of the bible.	2.8860124330006482
9096. a marked	impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the finney revivals.	6.270221259726968
9097. finney himself while opposed to slavery placed his chief emphasis	on evangelism but from his converts issued much of the leadership of	the anti-slavery campaign.	3.498688884480572
9098. theodore dwight weld was	especially active.	6.6423823285011645
9099. weld was the son and grandson of new england congregational	ministers.	4.531813603607614
9100. as a youth he became one of finney's band	of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men.	5.63916941301196
9101. a strong temperance	advocate through the influence of a favorite teacher charles	stewart another finney convert he devoted himself to the anti-slavery	cause.	3.580540754536752
9102. a group of young men influenced by him enrolled in lane theological	seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery	position.	6.041142430135846
9103. the majority then went to the infant oberlin.	4.244385730858102
9104. they and	others employed some of finney's techniques as they sought to win	adherents to the cause.	5.375337757755938
9105. weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions	of such men as joshua r giddings and edwin m stanton	enlisted john quincy adams and helped provide ideas which underlay	harriet beecher stowe's uncle tom's cabin.	3.014519318852914
9106. he shunned	publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame.	6.539538405204793
9107. wendell phillips	from a prominent massachusetts family in his teens	was converted under the preaching of lyman beecher.	3.3473553651414933
9108. although he	later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently	outspoken against social evils he remained a devout christian.	5.718745860067193
9109. he was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition	but he also stood for equal rights for women for opportunity for the	freedmen and for prohibition.	3.349613060594039
9110. the anti-slavery movement and	other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership	and financial undergirding by arthur tappan and his younger	brother lewis tappan.	4.2142950488235495
9111. individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power	were transmuted at death into awesome spirits; they were almost immediately	worshipped for these newer even more terrible abilities.	3.0634269936708303
9112. their	direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes but also	the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of	the universe.	5.2743362017269
9113. royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly	achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power.	3.474580153873458
9114. thus	the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less	puissant ancestors.	5.29555279932627
9115. but this eminence was not without its weighty	responsibilities.	5.030582382418328
9116. since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe	of living beings and dead spirits the emperor had to use it for	the benefit of the living.	5.796951201800653
9117. the royal ritual generated power into the	other world: it also provided the living with a way to control the	spirits and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs	of the world.	3.2791391596967125
9118. proper ritual observance at any level of society was	capable of generating power for use in the spirit world; but naturally	the royal ritual which provided unusual control over already supremely	powerful divine spirits was held responsible for regulating the	universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom.	4.681565033721146
9119. this is the	familiar system of cosmic government.	5.043118322102606
9120. the chinese emperor by	proper observance of ritual manifested divine powers.	5.126213144767318
9121. he regulated	the dualities of light and darkness yang and yin which are	locked in eternal struggle.	3.555294727400845
9122. by swaying the balance between them he	effected the alternation of the seasons.	6.1332435530236085
9123. his power was so great that	he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given	ear or been deaf to petitions.	3.3540427092171705
9124. in this system no man is exempt	from obligations.	7.239854911549436
9125. failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's	family outrages to community propriety any departure from rigid	standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead.	3.137228868698504
9126. and to	offend the dead meant to incur their wrath and thus provoke the unleashing	of countrywide disasters.	5.1233747312847955
9127. the family home was in fact a temple;	and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in	nature.	3.8529295600251783
9128. the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and	in every fear.	5.548470934104797
9129. the common belief was that there existed one	moral order which included everything.	3.6032953969796773
9130. the dead controlled the material	prosperity of the living and the living adhered to strict codes of	conduct in order not to weaken that control.	5.021976504353511
9131. men believed they could	control nature by obeying a moral code.	3.9422729026777628
9132. if the moral code were flouted	the proper balance of the universe would be upset and the disastrous	result could be floods plague or famine.	5.495779504801484
9133. modern westerners	have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material	largely because in the west the historical trend has been to deny the	connection.	3.748359669218019
9134. living in urban conditions away from the deadweight of	village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view	the individual may find it possible say to commit adultery not only	without personal misgivings but also without suffering any adverse	effects in his worldly fortunes.	4.590532718703612
9135. basing action on the empirical determination	of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no	powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart- plus the added liberation	from the constraint of silent burial urns.	3.0076133533810068
9136. in china	the magical system par excellence was taoism.	6.016951197696949
9137. the taoists were quietist	mystics who saw an unchanging unity- the tao- underlying	all phenomena.	2.9868979856335747
9138. it was this timeless unity that was all-important and	not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality.	6.354519634686674
9139. the taoists	believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation;	in other words they were actually an organization of magicians.	3.2104656219710166
9140. mahayana buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical	concepts.	6.294711597510789
9141. after this form of indian buddhism had been introduced	into china it underwent extensive changes.	3.988503146092208
9142. during its flowering in	the sixth to the eighth centuries mahayana offered a supernatural package	to the chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested	philosophical zen morsels offered to the modern western reader.	5.165220113507127
9143. mahayana	had gods and magic a pantheon heavens and hells and gorgeously	appareled priests monks and nuns all of whom wielded power over	souls in the other world.	3.2218627655246337
9144. the self-realized mahayana saint possessed	superhuman powers and magic.	5.029811453147388
9145. the mahayana that developed in the	north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic that made the world	into a huge magical garden.	3.0287184024504676
9146. in its monastic form mahayana was merely	an organization of magic-practicing monks who catered	to the chinese faith in the supernatural.	5.2701988766824295
9147. nonmagical confucianism	was a secular rational philosophy but even with this different	orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government.	3.4546661345476317
9148. confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power.	6.313195192103957
9149. if a man lived a classical life he need not fear the spirits- for	only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him.	3.6018106768083435
9150. but let us not be	mistaken about confucian virtue; this was not virtue as we	understand the word today and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief	in magic manipulation.	5.290689192386159
9151. to the confucian virtue simply meant	mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual	and three thousand minor ones.	3.616145732160408
9152. propriety was synonymous with ritual	observance the mark of a true gentleman.	5.6279124928512365
9153. to live correctly in an	interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive	for man's fate.	3.7294558628639427
9154. this in brief was the historical background	out of which zen emerged.	6.2725713127660185
9155. promoters of zen to the west record	its ancestry and recognize that zen grew out of a combination of	taoism and indian mahayana buddhism.	3.9463509989967003
9156. but the marvelous person	that is supposed to result from zen exhibits more chinese practicality	than indian speculation- he possesses magical powers and can	use them to order nature and to redeem souls.	4.784648652716778
9157. proponents of zen to	the west emphasize disproportionately the amount of mahayana buddhism	in zen probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical taoist	ideas with more respectable buddhist metaphysic.	3.3398122932597194
9158. but in the chinese	mind there was little difference between the two- the bonzes	were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be.	5.721588813477856
9159. actually	zen owes more to chinese quietism than it does to mahayana buddhism.	3.9217553064526594
9160. the ch'an sect may have derived its metaphysic from	mahayana but its psychology was pure early taoist.	4.465885718086515
9161. this is well	evidenced	by the quietist doctrines carried over in zen: the idea of	the inward turning of thought the enjoinder to put aside desires and	perturbations so that a return to purity peace and stillness- a	union with the infinite with the tao- could be effected.	3.1781779728019606
9162. in fact	the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so	uniquely characteristic of the direct thinking zennist was a feature	of taoism.	4.826037445132931
9163. so too was the insistence on the relativity of the	external world and the ideas that language and things perceived by	consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by	pure indwelling spirit: the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating	consciousness.	3.1459061302959372
9164. zen maintains that cognitive things	are only the surface of experience.	6.085136454512673
9165. one of its features attractive	to the west is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred	texts.	4.1612718423039885
9166. one patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures	for use in an outhouse.	6.465936737136281
9167. but this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom	of action for which the westerner mistakes it.	5.442482950852702
9168. it is simply that	in taoist tradition- as in all good mysticisms- books words	or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness	are considered only the surface of experience.	5.165414170003359
9169. the truth- the	eternal truth- is not transmittable by words.	3.2882637095245957
9170. reality is considered	not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge but	a positive handicap.	5.505663305628732
9171. the technique of reality confusion- the use of	paradox and riddles to shake the mind's grip on reality- originated	with fourth and third century bc chinese quietism: the	koan is not basically a new device.	2.9198939961692325
9172. it is important for an	understanding of zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of	the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man.	6.089890869936941
9173. in the supernatural	atmosphere of cosmic government only the ruling elite was ever	concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature: popular religion	aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers.	3.1044337843279908
9174. and this is only	natural- witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest	wonder drug.	5.7328636131695925
9175. early chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed	at a mystic pantheist union with the divine personal salvation being	achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence.	3.268395488610077
9176. but	this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers.	5.808642006526823
9177. the anchorite strove in fact to magically influence the world	of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power.	3.604170366870117
9178. thus the mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was	distilled down to a bare self-seeking and for this reason the mystic	in asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation.	5.2549073273330755
9179. as the zen	literature reveals as soon as an early zen master attained fame in	seclusion he was called out into the world to exercise his powers.	4.193088690730573
9180. the early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed	ability to perform miracles.	5.552126982950668
9181. exponents of zen often insist	that very early zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism	of china and proposed instead a more mature less credulous view of	the universe.	3.0720298928174707
9182. in support of this stories from the early literature are	cited to show that zen attacks the idea of supernatural power.	6.4239331238116355
9183. but	actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters	were in fact supposed to possess as well as the extreme degree of	popular credulity: hwang pah one day going up mount	tien tai h which was believed to have been inhabited by arhats	with supernatural powers met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light.	3.192043279808382
9184. they went along the pass talking with each other for a short while	until they came to a river roaring with torrent.	6.0747502809011795
9185. there being no bridge	the master had to stop at the shore; but his companion crossed	the river walking on the water and beckoned to hwang pah to follow	him.	3.625632459680671
9186. thereupon hwang pah said: if i knew thou art an arhat	i would have doubled you up before thou got over there! the monk	then understood the spiritual attainment of hwang pah and praised	him as a true mahayanist.	4.501945261163185
9187. a second tale shows still	more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess:	on one occasion yang shan saw a stranger monk flying	through the air.	3.2999388635193476
9188. when that monk came down and approached him with a	respectful salutation he asked: where art thou from?	5.442961663081946
9189.  early	this morning replied the other i set out from india.	4.04813603068762
9190. why said the teacher art thou so late?	7.169436673888457
9191.  i stopped	responded the man several times to look at beautiful sceneries.	4.54432179308934
9192. thou mayst have supernatural powers exclaimed yang shan	yet thou must give back the spirit of buddha to me.	5.282700193451651
9193. then	the monk praised yang shan saying: i have come over to china	in order to worship manjucri and met unexpectedly with minor shakya	and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from india	went back through the air.	2.9846179157309467
9194. in the popular chinese	mind ch'an was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that	dominated.	5.7433431520012
9195. a closer look at modern zen reveals many magical	carryovers that are still part of popular zen attitudes.	3.523839707650874
9196. to the	zen monk the universe is still populated with spiritual beings	who have to be appeased.	6.384160360274963
9197. part of the mealtime ritual in the zendo consists	in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings.	3.9451110600796
9198. modern zen presentation	to the west insists on the anti-authoritarian highly pragmatic	nature of the zen belief- scriptures are burned to make fire	action is based on direct self-confidence and so on.	4.903549983280586
9199. this picture	of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such	zendo formulas as: o you demons and other spiritual beings	i now offer this to you and may this food fill up the ten quarters	of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith.	3.33544890389448
9200. pope leo 13 on the 13th day of december 1898 granted	the following indulgences: an indulgence of three hundred days is	granted to all the faithful who read the holy gospels at least a	quarter of an hour.	5.049293540521412
9201. a plenary indulgence under the usual conditions	is granted once a month for the daily reading.	3.9126514449419645
9202. pope pius the sixth	at rome in april 1778 wrote the following: the faithful	should be excited to the reading of the holy scriptures: for these	are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone	to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine to eradicate	errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times.	4.495914012033198
9203. the	american bishops assembled at the third plenary council of baltimore	urged the catholic people to read the holy bible.	3.7117067648772637
9204. we hope	they said that no family can be found amongst us without a	correct version of the holy scriptures.	6.346367349391032
9205. they recommended also	that at a fixed hour let the entire family be assembled for night	prayers followed by a short reading of the holy scriptures.	3.713477242958242
9206. since the catholic church expresses such desire that the sacred	scriptures be read the following taken from the holy bible	will prove a means of grace and a source of great	spiritual blessing.	5.522640035097785
9207. do not wonder that	i said to thee you must be born again.	4.964210356780691
9208. but as the one	who called you is holy be you also holy in all your behavior; for	it is written you shall be holy because i am holy.	5.20342681653858
9209. 1 st peter	1:15 16.	6.283774572224434
9210. holiness without which no man will see god.	6.420742603321891
9211. as it is written there is not one just man; there is none	who understands; there is none who seeks after god.	4.182177226991916
9212. all have gone	astray together; h all have sinned and have need of the glory of	the new birth is necessary because the	therefore as through	one man sin entered into the world and through sin death and thus death	has passed unto all men because all have sinned.	5.074194092344191
9213. you also when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins.	4.4391257356220555
9214. and if our gospel also is veiled it is veiled	only to those who are perishing.	6.700036685766754
9215. in their case the god of this	world satan has blinded their unbelieving minds that they should	not see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image	of god.	3.841907469051241
9216. for his workmanship	the new birth	is effected through the word of god	not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible through the word of	god.	5.626075927245753
9217. of his own will he has begotten	us by the word of truth.	5.3929233335385405
9218. amen amen	i say to thee unless a man be born again of water symbol of the	word of god see ephesians 5:26 and the spirit he cannot enter	into the kingdom of god.	4.93019122092848

9222. whoever is born of god does not commit sin that is he does not	practice sin.	6.266002021898172
9223. cf 1 st john 2:1.	4.811405974659635
9224. we know that no one who is born of god commits sin.	9.102806500153928

9275. the choice is	yours: god is in your hands now.	4.289698574479567
9276. god has already set	the day when you will be in his hands.	7.612685743450474
9277. what he does with you then	depends on what you do with him now.	4.5599723627192565
9278. then it will be	a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god if you	have abused him in your hands.	6.177555322758147

9289. experts in the publishing	field consider this astounding.	4.7399295359140865
9290. they do not understand how a small	magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved	such a following.	5.580701278379094
9291. to me the explanation is very simple.	5.539441358880021
9292. i	am not doing anything of myself.	7.139258208469207
9293. i am merely a channel for h something.	4.734321005926065
9294. what is this something?	10.400481966182154
9295.  i cannot define it fully.	5.565393484866763
9296. it is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness even	when they turn away from it.	6.0642377443193105
9297. it is the power that holds the stars in	their orbits but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass.	3.84738637288024
9298. it is the	whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is.	6.706932783073557

9301. sometimes such people sense that they are being	used; sometimes not.	5.102552140114176
9302. fifteen years ago troubled by the rising	tide of materialism in the post-war world a businessman and a minister	asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine	in which men and women regardless of creed or color could set	forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power	of faith to solve the endless problems of living.	4.949957940610831
9303. the businessman	was raymond thornburg.	3.9664433819737637

9367. havana was filled with an excitement which you could see	in the brightness of men's eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices.	3.4078083948615148
9368. the hated dictator batista had fled.	5.460312512643972
9369. rumors flew from lip to lip	that fidel castro was on his way to havana coming from the mountains	where he had fought batista for five years.	3.4532780280712525
9370. already the city was	filled with barbudos the bearded war-dirty revolutionaries carrying	carbines waving to the crowds that lined the prado.	4.910265947032969
9371. and	then castro himself did come bearded smiling; yet if you looked closely	you'd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips.	3.476594993827418
9372. at first i was happy to throw the support of our newspaper	behind this man.	6.680031564304509
9373. i am sure that castro was happy too about that support.	4.588173343188976
9374. diario de la marina was the oldest and most influential paper	in cuba with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny.	5.192606450521913

9376. my own earliest	memories are of exiles: my three brothers and i were taken often	to the united states to visit relatives while my father stayed	on to fight the dictator machado.	5.379034962725291
9377. when it was my turn i too	printed the truth as i knew it about batista and rejoiced to see	his regime topple.	4.006175291234616
9378. none of us was aware that the biggest fight was	still ahead.	6.459466362726644
9379. i was full of hope as fidel castro came into havana.	4.395999673234041
9380. within a week however i began to suspect that something was	wrong.	6.798113316309318
9381. for castro was bringing cuba not freedom but hatred.	4.151426763499277
9382. he spent	long hours before the tv spitting out promises of revenge.	5.690186821478643
9383. he	showed us how he dealt with his enemies: he executed them before	tv cameras.	3.5497263964327748
9384. on home sets children were watching the death throes	of men who were shot before the paredon the firing wall.	5.734502772770598
9385. castro's	reforms?	7.781497302878112
9386.  he seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance.	6.565801228785073
9387. new	schools were rising but with this went a harsh proclamation: any	academic degree earned during batista's regime was invalid.	3.2762678224283075
9388. economic aid?	10.423879337409424
9389.  he had promised cheaper housing: arbitrarily he cut	all rents in half whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator	or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room.	3.232908293803943
9390. under	another law hundreds of farms were seized.	6.165792612216901
9391. farm workers had their wages	cut almost in half.	4.152121343726326
9392. of this only 50 cents a day was paid in cash	the rest in script usable only in people's stores.	5.674950015873187
9393. a	suspicion was growing that fidel castro was a communist.	4.158296772260084
9394. in my mind	i began to review: his use of hate to gain support; his people's	courts; his division of society into two classes one the hero	the other the villain.	4.810392348379791
9395. but most disturbing of all were the advisers	he called to sit with him in the palace; many came from communist	countries.	3.8784332692661954
9396. what should i do about it i asked myself?	8.166520371593599
9397. 	i had watched castro handling his enemies before the paredon.	3.685606633086131
9398. there	was no doubt in my mind that if i crossed him mobs would appear outside	our windows shouting paredon! paredon! h   what	should i do?	5.159204496217456
9399.  i was proud of the new buildings which housed diario	now: the rotogravures gleaming behind glass doors; the thump	and whir of our new presses.	3.5871828164536312
9400. here was a powerful ready-made medium	but it could speak only if i told it to.	6.146770422488738
9401. then one day early	in january 1960 i sat down at my desk and suddenly i was aware	of the crucifix.	3.6708850427248367
9402. it was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had	given me.	6.291000902925309
9403. i had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind	me always to use the power of the paper in a christian manner.	4.144707281395465
9404. now it seemed almost as if jesus were looking down at me with sadness	in his eyes saying:   you will lose the paper.	5.37794443367263
9405. you may	lose your life.	6.3265333695239345
9406. but do you have any choice?	8.968065935181995
9407.    i knew in that	moment that i did not have any choice.	5.500731370128041
9408. from that day on i began	to write editorials about the things i did not think correct in	fidel castro's regime.	5.921821177713115
9409. too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly	either because his parents don't want sonny-boy to lift all	those old barbell things because you'll stunt your growth	h or because childish taunts from his schoolmates like hey h	lookit mr america h whaddya gonna do with all those muscles	?	3.014160047368443
9410.    after all a guy's gotta	have a little ego!   therefore it's a genuine pleasure	to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had	to train in secret h has never heard one unkind word from his parents	h and never has been taunted by his schoolmates!	this happy always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new	junior mr canada- henri de courcy.	4.395143848801306
9411. far from discouraging	henri his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments.	3.982826412703414
9412. instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they	personally took him to that master montreal bodybuilding authority	professor roland claude.	5.630048278087377
9413. and they couldn't have entrusted	henri to better hands because le professeur knows his muscles	from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis	anticus of the leg h and better still he knows just what	exercises work best for them and what weider principles to combine	them with for fast fast muscle growth.	3.1615368031983433
9414. that's because the	good professor teaches only weider methods at his famous montreal	health studio which is located at 1821 mt royal east in montreal.	4.811098533609361
9415. undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning	pupils.	5.116058098825136
9416. there's gaetan d'amours who is our newest mr canada	h jean-paul senesac whose story appeared here two issues ago	h jack boissoneault who was with us last month h charles harve	who recently won the most muscular man subdivision award	in the event h and a host of others.	4.309424967030224
9417. yesiree h	the professor knows his muscles!   now when henri was just	12 he was only 4' 10'' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds	and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight.	2.995463236090383
9418. about that time	he began reading	and he learned of the famous weider way to fast weight gaining.	5.890845192187617
9419. seeing	so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value	of those two wonder-working	weider food supplements he decided to try them and see what they	could do for him.	3.306202371998502
9420. well sir h they did real great! for	in almost less time than it takes to tell it henri's bodyweight was	increasing rapidly.	5.068074494298814
9421. of course he did some exercising h he's crazy	about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction	with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle	on his skinny frame.	3.2246242471990265
9422. henri has always had shapely legs from swimming	and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much.	4.997995737299487
9423. but he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body.	4.849464587666985
9424. it was muscular	but it wasn't symmetrical.	7.050585778236506
9425. a real 'nothing' torso says	henri.	4.537725700872162
9426. it never seemed to widen h it just got longer and longer.	6.396658126704571
9427. that's when he went to professor claude.	4.831871415278287
9428. and at	once claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct	it.	5.798870672237193
9429. in his gym the professor has some of the most knocked out equipment	since vic tanny.	4.843519982586332
9430. mr claude is a specialist in torso development	and he has long favored the now-famous weider push-pull	super-set technique in which one exercise of the super-set is	a or pushing movement which accents one sector of	a muscle group in a specific way followed by a pulling exercise	which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group.	4.683630289181301
9431. so	right away claude introduced henri to his famous moon bench	and proceeded to teach him his first push-pull super-set consisting	of the wide-grip straight-arm pullover	which dramatically widens the ribcage and	strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest h and the	collar-to-collar bench press which specifically works on the chest to	build those wide reeves-type gladiator pecs while stimulating	the upper lats and frontal deltoids.	2.783569597945526
9432. as you can see	in this push-pull super set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is	vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises h so	the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time!   now when	henri has completed four complete push-pull super-sets no 1	the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting	him on four complete push-pull super-sets no 2.	4.312111749099431
9433. super-set	no 2 is made up of similar exercises but this time done	with dumbbells and using both moon and flat benches.	3.6087693466032587
9434. the push	exercise of this push-pull super-set is the bench press done	with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of	the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation.	4.622206260508859
9435. you need the	barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs h the dumbbell	variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the pecs.	3.4937700110840786
9436. the pull exercise in this super-set is the one-dumbbell	bent-arm pullover.	5.193964279524225
9437. the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise	because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation	.	3.212230920271644
9438. in the third push-pull super-set the push	exercise is the widegrip pushup between bars while the pull	exercise is the moon bench lateral raise with bent arms.	4.8571296866795075
9439. the pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage	stretcher ever invented! this is true if a very wide grip	is used and is	achieved.	3.6160925333853515
9440. you'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because	your shoulder blades will touch! as you see the professor has designed	a piece of apparatus that the bodybuilder to use	a w-i-d-e grip h he has to; he just can't do anything about it at	all!   but as you can also see it's not a painful exercise	at all because henri de courcy- the happy bodybuilder-	looks as though he were having the time of his life!   the last	exercise of roland claude's prescribed program for henri is a single	exercise done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between	sets.	4.483677726075398
9441. by this time henri's entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area	is pumped-up to almost bursting point and claude takes time to	do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work.	3.3091706189623493
9442. he has henri do	from four to six sets of the incline bench press.	5.835649918357293
9443. this gives a wide flare to the pecs causing them to flow	dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the	serratus and lats.	3.4079461496406984
9444. this is the kind of chest that invariably	wins contests h that steel-edged carved-out-of-solid rock looks	of the great champions.	5.676425732887602
9445. so with four complete push-pull	super-sets no 1 four of no 2 four of no 3 and four to	six sets of the incline bench press you can see that henri de courcy	has had a terrific mass-building muscle-shaping torso-defining	workout that cannot be improved upon.	3.449097255958116
9446. physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone h	rarer still is a mr america or mr universe of true herculean	build.	4.804174854648616
9447. the aspects of physical development that catch the judges'	eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry	and that hallmark of the true champion- superior definition	of the muscles.	3.019016509231155
9448. now good definition is one thing that all of us can	acquire with occasional high-set high-rep light-weight workouts.	5.991621358309315
9449. but contest definition- that dramatic muscular separation of every	muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's	chisel- is something quite different.	3.6406538844179357
9450. this comes not alone	from high-set high-rep training but from certain definition-specialization	exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge	of exactly what works best for him.	4.851549768469525
9451. often these exercises	work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others.	3.847065437901452
9452. because they are minority exercises and have but a limited	appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten.	5.923822932502075
9453. only	when the newest mr america or mr universe rediscovers	them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and	once again see how effective they really are.	3.1510959480065064
9454. the exercise i	shall discuss in this- the first of a new series of articles on muscle	definition-specialization of a particular body part- is the one	leg lunge.	5.1529242853055495
9455. why it was ever forgotten for even a moment i cannot say	because it works perfectly for everyone no matter whether he has	short or long thigh-bone lengths!   it is the one exercise	that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the-	that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other	bodybuilders h a criterion of muscle drama that is unforgettable	to judges and audiences alike h the facet of muscular development	that wins prizes.	3.0244339952279526
9456. definition of the thighs at the uppermost	part is quite commonly seen in most championship olympic lifters which	is easily understandable.	5.058468943406444
9457. the one leg lunge is a and	all lifters practice this in their regular workouts.	3.6029038512288056
9458. but for	purely definition purposes- used in conjunction with your regular	squatting leg curling leg extensor programs- a heavy weight is	not needed.	4.8667631808422716
9459. indeed a lighter weight works much better because a greater	more extensive split can be performed.	3.776056088660977
9460. used in several sets of	high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire	upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look	like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin!   really	there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way	into your leg program at all times for the following suggestions show	why it is so effective:  it's a thigh contraction-extension	exercise.	4.798187158318361
9461. it places terrific tension on	the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition.	3.861626344964517
9462. it	improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder and helps	to make squats more easily and more correctly performed.	5.044488092322103
9463. it	increases flexibility of the legs.	4.749238031432153
9464. it speeds muscle growth	and power development even for the bodybuilder because	each hip and leg is exercised separately thus enabling a massive concentrated	effort to be focused on each.	4.9076195683587125
9465. you'll need your weider	power stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's	done:  place your power stands in position and adjust their	height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders	when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy clean.	3.424845612483323
9466. place	a suitably-loaded barbell across them; grasp the bar	; extend your feet forward and	backward until you are in a deep leg split.	5.046970405464611
9467. now raise the weight	by leg without moving your	feet.	4.394720899478833
9468. when the front knee is straight and allow it	to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the	sides of the power stands.	5.489617971253887
9469. after you have taken a breather	the position of your legs so that the thigh	of the and the	thigh now to the and perform the same movement	in the same manner.	3.763272081845405
9470. that's the one-leg lunge in a nutshell.	6.360334858279849
9471. you should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you	make your first	experiments h just for safety.	4.271974323899781
9472. you should also begin	this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed	to it balance-wise.	5.963654509900695
9473. oh you'll wobble and weave quite a bit	at first.	4.054229657597859
9474. before your first training experiment	has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it	you'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran!	although i suggested that you hold the bar at the of	the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments	with the bar held in of the neck.	4.9500569422464284
9475. squat-style lifters and	leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those	variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the	and.	3.1547484067058362
9476. the most beautiful bed of pansies i've seen was in a south	dakota yard on a sizzling day.	5.488520743047094
9477. pansies are supposed to like it	cool but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring	sun.	3.4105859443455264
9478. i sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce	such beauties in that weather.	5.951102412412
9479. he seemed puzzled by my question.	4.966254581020933
9480. i just love them he said.	8.067514083367675
9481. the more i talked with him	the more convinced i became that that was the secret of their riotous	blooming.	3.7443997991455498
9482. of course his love was expressed in intelligent care.	6.7295267643301315
9483. he planted the pansy seeds himself buying them from a pansy specialist.	3.9056905087644314
9484. these specialists i learned have done a great deal of work to	improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers.	6.087157311267585
9485. their	seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the	unimproved strains.	4.018786670311021
9486. i asked him if he took seeds from his own	plants.	7.130051968159138
9487. occasionally when he had an unusual flower that he wanted	more of he did; but pansy seeds he told me soon run down.	3.7776990617897273
9488. it's	best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them.	6.113949157559169
9489. his soil was nothing special just prairie land but	he had harrowed in compost until it was loose spongy and brown-black.	3.350947019694796
9490. i fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the	right texture tilth and body.	5.7182060889071185
9491. it isn't easy to describe it but every	gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil.	3.7722309675002905
9492. nothing	is easier to grow from seed than pansies.	6.124183810974422
9493. they germinate quickly the	tiny plants appearing in a week and grow along lustily.	4.120815246012635
9494. it doesn't	really matter which month of the year you sow them but they germinate	best when they have a wide variation of temperature very warm followed	by cool in the same 24 hours.	5.765145485058178
9495. i like to make a seedbed	right in the open though many people start them successfully in cold	frames.	4.532092810485396
9496. pansies don't have to be coddled; they'd rather have things	rugged with only moderate protection on the coldest days.	5.511114287206963
9497. if you	do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate.	4.503526972573782
9498. for my seedbed i use good garden soil with a little sand added to	encourage rooting.	5.688728170993289
9499. i dig it rake it smooth sow the seeds and wet them	down with a fog spray.	3.4614658912641856
9500. then i cover the sowing with a board.	7.248649049577353
9501. this	keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds.	3.865768643618338
9502. ants carry away	the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby.	6.468857816737676
9503. when the first sprinkling of green appears i remove the board.	4.498323365048742
9504. a	light porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft	during these early days of growth.	5.307652128749716
9505. i like sawdust for this or hay.	5.280231197749852
9506. when they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants it's	time to set them out where they are to remain.	5.911230671560652
9507. every time you transplant	a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller.	3.95345596015851
9508. the moral is:	don't transplant it any oftener than you must.	4.966285088665778
9509. as soon as they	are large enough to move i put mine 9 inches apart where they are	to bloom.	3.934235871072967
9510. i put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed	bone meal into each hole with the plant.	5.2596332174714195
9511. that encourages rooting and	the better developed the roots the larger and more plentiful the flowers.	3.8960795998548656
9512. i doubt if it is possible to overfeed	them.	9.695485790242662
9513. i spade lots of compost into their bed; lacking that	decayed manure spread over the bed is fine.	3.5007864217173124
9514. one year i simply set the	plants in the remains of a compost pile to which a little sand had	been added and i had the most beautiful pansies in my or any of my	neighbors' experience.	5.560365216337875
9515. in addition to the rich soil they benefit by	feedings of manure water every other week diluted to the color of weak	tea.	3.7646111884227533
9516. as a substitute for this organic fertilizer dissolved in water	to half the strength in the directions may be used.	5.852681054066394
9517. we put a light mulch over the seedlings; now we must use	a heavy one.	3.9680414949193814
9518. three inches of porous material will do a good job of	keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool.	5.874960893743825
9519. when winter comes	be ready with additional mulch.	4.723084522813695
9520. i like hay for this and apply it	so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost.	5.907462724578415
9521. that	keeps in the cold retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate	freezing and thawing.	3.6217800280747388
9522. don't miss the pansies that appear	from time to time through the winter.	5.9500385311447745
9523. whenever there is a thaw or	a few sunny days you'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or	two.	4.000066125351258
9524. if those aren't enough for you why not grow some just for winter	blooming?	5.9080750956262476
9525.  the pansies i cherished most bloomed for me in february	during a particularly cold winter.	3.3196198396359016
9526. i started the seed in a flat	in june and set out the little pansies in a cold frame.	6.106053716462895
9527. the plants	took zero nights in their stride with nothing but a mat of straw over	the glass to protect them.	3.1249883360216995
9528. in response to the lengthening days of february	they budded then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers.	5.419438827351123
9529. that	cold frame was my morale builder; its mass of bright bloom set in a	border of snow made my spirits rise every time i looked at it.	3.15148037505207
9530. like	strawberries in december pansies are far more exciting in february	than in may.	5.667858803709047
9531. try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold	and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it.	3.6501433801449417
9532. the day will come in midsummer when you find your plants becoming	leggy running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms.	4.97266160491415
9533. try pegging down each separate branch to the earth using a bobby	pin to hold it there.	3.698955856271838
9534. pick the flowers keep the soil dampened and	each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little	plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season.	5.083754904470131
9535. as soon as an experimental	tug assures you that roots have taken over cut it off from	the mother plant.	3.9613721574611955
9536. a second and also good practice is to shear	off the tops leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each	branch.	5.167045772338811
9537. these cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time	and will behave just as they did in early spring.	3.6775031340893394
9538. i like to shear half	my plants at a time leaving one half of them to blossom while the	second half is getting started on its new round of blooming.	5.882836425106257
9539. probably	no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to	let the blossoms go to seed.	3.998000265906771
9540. nature's aim different from ours is	to provide for the coming generation.	6.198133269626666
9541. that done her work is accomplished	and she ignores the plant.	4.225541840965002
9542. here is a word of advice when	you go shopping for your pansy seeds.	6.793781917180877
9543. go to a reputable grower preferably	a pansy specialist.	4.509456645475139
9544. it is no harder to raise big healthy blooming	plants than weak sickly little things; in fact it is easier.	5.610380363720731
9545. but	you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow.	3.837010546318981
9546. many	people think that pansies last only a few weeks then their period	of growth and bloom is over.	5.938338006357941
9547. if the plants are cared	for and protected over the winter the second year is more prolific	than the first.	3.6490106483357434
9548. would you like to grow exhibition pansies?	8.344259307522938
9549. 	remove about half the branches from each plant leaving only the strongest	with the largest buds.	3.4889060505014133
9550. the flowers will be huge.	6.2063375443315225
9551. they stick to their principles insist upon their	due but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it.	3.3427254140586133
9552. treat	them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except	the frigid ones.	5.5958892626678605
9553. give them food some shade mulch water and more	food and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty.	3.357301152168583
9554. a salad with	greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition	to a meal but add an avocado and you have something really special.	4.779896081967832
9555. this delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past	thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible	to ship avocado anywhere in the united states.	3.5958014141516967
9556. it has a great	many assets to recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part	of your diet yet you really should.	5.52465904870821
9557. you will find that avocado	is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted.	4.441921927818566
9558. it is roughly shaped	like a large pear and when properly ripened its dark green skin covers	a meaty melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe	bartlett pear but oily.	4.604680476450514
9559. the avocado should have a give to it	as you hold it when it is ripe.	3.9871435129680206
9560. the flavor is neither sweet like	a pear nor tart like an orange; it is subtle and rather bland nut-like.	4.675102802975392
9561. it is a flavor that might take a little getting used to- not	because it is unpleasant but because the flavor is hard to define in	the light of our experience with other fruits.	3.614076869078964
9562. sometimes it takes several	eatings of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste	that has made it such a favorite throughout the world.	5.482923028524144
9563. once you become	an avocado fan you will look forward to the season each year with	eager anticipation.	4.039662487592803
9564. today	refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible	to any place in the world.	5.751043471108431
9565. the fruit is allowed to mature on the tree	but it is still firm at this point.	3.7660861108131733
9566. it is brought to packing houses	cleaned and graded as to size and quality and packed in protective	excelsior.	5.722555243900683
9567. the fruit is then cooled to 42`f a temperature at which	it lapses into a sort of dormant state.	3.306830373101673
9568. this cooling does not change	the avocado in any way it just delays the natural softening of	the fruit until a grovelike temperature is restored.	4.969771503755859
9569. this happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen.	3.9453360965448385
9570. one	of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require	processing of any kind.	6.539555371971623
9571. there is no dyeing or waxing or gassing	needed.	4.571791947126656
9572. if the temperature is controlled properly the avocado will delay	its ripening until needed.	5.677295539022536
9573. and unlike other fruits one cannot eat	the skin of the avocado.	3.944562464799821
9574. it is thick much like an egg plant's skin	so that poison sprays if they are used present no hazard to the	consumer.	5.476923510686645
9575. good taste and	versatility	plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend	the frequent use of such a fruit even if its nutritional values were	limited.	3.629552581810477
9576. avocados however are very rich in nutrients.	6.587963944722083
9577. their main	asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids so necessary for maintaining	the good health of the circulatory system.	3.5928398305487663
9578. aside from this	the average portion contains some protein an appreciable amount of vitamins	a and c- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement	and about a third of the official vitamin e requirement.	4.956160299180847
9579. the	b vitamins are well represented especially thiamin and riboflavin.	3.800973385606458
9580. calcium phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts	and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts.	5.133252079757786
9581. none of these values is destroyed not significantly altered by refrigeration	storage.	4.119222876298838
9582. dr wilson c grant of the veterans'	administration hospital coral gables florida and the university	of miami school of medicine set out to discover if avocados	because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids would reduce	the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients.	4.77592730557796
9583. the study comprised	16 male patients ranging in age from 27 to 72.	3.3720408339403583
9584. they were put	on control diets to determine as accurately as possible the normal cholesterol	level of their blood.	5.48910988795772
9585. then they were given 12 to 1-12 avocados	per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption.	4.06545294565412
9586. five four three two one fire! the tremendous energy	released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than	it can be heard.	4.889004868148806
9587. the pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the	pit of your stomach.	3.2045700276101408
9588. never before has the introduction of a weapon	caused so much apprehension and fear.	5.793855286779919
9589. nuclear weapons are fearsome	but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless	swiftness which is much more terrifying.	3.5840705844706444
9590. a great many writers	are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker	would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear	rockets.	5.28439495633175
9591. it is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that	an attacker in possession of such absolute power would simultaneously	destroy his opponent's cities and people.	3.4508624484212156
9592. with a nation defenseless	before it why would the attacker spare the victim's people?	5.982472210362795
9593. 	wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical	act of complete subjugation?	3.5952159442188836
9594.  the nation would be utterly devastated.	6.793393642187533
9595. the will of its people so crucial in time of peril would be broken.	4.007200970352072
9596. nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction	in hours or days; and now rockets have given it the means	to destroy itself in minutes.	5.292381591746525
9597. at this point it should be painfully obvious	that cities being soft and the people within them are ideally	suited to destruction by nuclear weapons.	3.999508425521179
9598. however because	this vulnerability is mutual it is to the advantage of neither side	to destroy the opponent's cities at least so long as the opponent	has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal.	5.823635862627031
9599. it should be appallingly	apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic.	4.843727349639689
9600. icbms have given us a capability which could be used in	two different ways.	6.316843161958008
9601. they could be used to attack a nation's people		or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military	force.	4.465731176467585
9602. if our national interest lies in being able to	fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide then we must	take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles.	5.285814463592529
9603. we must	determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves.	4.247777093841232
9604. we must make	certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job	to the missile.	5.932916057465444
9605. missiles are very valuable weapons but they	also have their too little known limitations.	3.541729080881447
9606. because of a missile's	ballistic trajectory the location of a fixed target must be	known quite accurately.	6.262317540204161
9607. placing missiles in submarines on barges railroads	highways surface vessels and in the air provides them with	passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range	ballistic missiles today- the extreme difficulty of destroying	a mobile or moving target with such weapons.	3.247654643951041
9608. one must first detect	a fleeting mobile or moving target decide that it is worthy of	destruction select the missile to be fired against the target	compute ballistics for the flight and prepare the missile for	firing.	5.167205515857239
9609. even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously	the icbm still has a time of flight to the target	of about 30 minutes.	3.7867836789705542
9610. therefore if the target can significantly change	its location in something less than 30 minutes the probability of	having destroyed it is drastically lowered.	5.404668999197193
9611. because of this	it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic	missiles will seek self-protection in mobility- at least until missile	defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability.	3.2137354946026466
9612. in order to destroy the enemy's mobile moving or imprecisely	located strategic forces we must have a hunter-killer capability	in addition to our missiles.	5.633816267977379
9613. until this hunter-killer operation	can be performed by spacecraft manned aircraft appear to be the only	means available to us.	4.054192512662989
9614. it seems reasonable that if general	nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's	citizens to cinders we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance	aircraft capable of going into china or russia to find and	destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us.	5.120397317881267
9615. let us suppose the russians decide to build a rail-mobile icbm	force.	4.885177656868808
9616. it is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the b-52	or b-70 in hunter-killer operations against soviet railway-based	missiles.	5.362571189632911
9617. if we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton	nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which	may be more appropriate for most important military targets it would	seem that the b-52 or b-70 could carry a great many small	nuclear weapons.	3.456374178334637
9618. an aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons	could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains	operating within a specified geographic area of russia- provided that	we had used some of our icbms to degrade russia's air defenses	before our bombers got there.	4.539030049662276
9619. the aircraft could be used to destroy	other mobile fleeting and imprecisely located targets as well as	the known fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by	missile.	3.370723505168428
9620. why then aren't we planning a larger more important	role for manned military aircraft?	5.759198819984517
9621.  is there any other way to do	the job?	5.627496567540631
9622.    survivability of our strategic forces	mobile and hardened minuteman hardened atlas and titan and airborne	means that it will take some time perhaps weeks to destroy	a strategic force.	4.878895923927739
9623. war under these circumstances cannot be one	massive exchange of nuclear devastation.	3.8083374168705957
9624. forces will survive a surprise	attack and these forces will give depth or considerable duration	to the conflict.	5.028463425573488
9625. the forces which survive the initial	attack	must be found and destroyed.	3.6809781121913736
9626. even mobile forces must be found and	destroyed.	7.574077441990206
9627. but how does one go about the job of finding and destroying	mobile forces?	4.304267191507224
9628.  they are not susceptible to wholesale destruction	by ballistic missile.	6.957138259497603
9629. some day many years in the future true	spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets.	5.097242126417535
9630. but until	we have an effective spacecraft the answer to the hunter-killer	problem is manned aircraft.	5.95695287402441
9631. however the aircraft which we have	today are tied to large soft airfields.	4.233843844636593
9632. nuclear rockets can	destroy airfields with ease.	6.9665816274228325
9633. here then is our problem: aircraft are	vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions	which a missile is totally incapable of performing; but the airfield	on which the aircraft is completely dependent is doomed by the missile.	3.284245001155801
9634. this makes today's aircraft a one-shot or one mission weapon.	5.757596814779995
9635. aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once.	4.564466880529652
9636. this is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft	in favor of the missile.	6.63968372060407
9637. but remember this- it isn't the aircraft	which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets it is the airfield.	3.863779265860338
9638. eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you	have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic	missiles.	5.401694550232045
9639. there are four rather obvious ways to reduce or	eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground:    put	aircraft in bomb-proof hangars when they are on the ground.	3.6590344238324573
9640. build long-range aircraft which can take off from small	airfields with runways.	5.915379568678253
9641. if we could use all the small airfields	we have in this country we could disperse our strategic aircraft	by a factor of 10 or more.	3.9160515887376355
9642. use nuclear propulsions to keep	our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their	useful life.	6.151524460320814
9643. using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines	develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing long-range	military aircraft.	3.9716918999562605
9644. we have the technology today with which to	build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 psi.	5.907178625111941
9645. we	could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters.	4.347406431915317
9646. large	long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability	to take off from 3000-foot runways but they would require more powerful	engines than we have today.	5.583403294743497
9647. there is little enthusiasm for spending	money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief	that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile.	3.9068212504859656
9648. this	same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted	in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft.	5.164739669569507
9649. one seldom hears the analogy nuclear propulsion will do for	the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine.	3.822107290513156
9650. if	for some reason such as economy we are not going to develop aircraft	nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency then we should	turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio	of 12 or 15 to one.	4.960480355753284
9651. with powerplants such as these vertical takeoff	and landing combat aircraft could be built.	3.961368956634082
9652. for example a 12-to-one	engine would power a supersonic vtol fighter.	6.527820142438285
9653. with a 15-to-one	engine a supersonic aircraft weighing 300000 pounds could rise	vertically.	4.061530884037006
9654. the reason that we are not going ahead full speed to	develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a	billion dollars- and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft	are obsolete.	5.664135109134983
9655. when aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields	they are no longer vulnerable to icbms.	4.16182141568476
9656. if our sac	bombers were today capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and	because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability	to strike at russia again and again and again those bombers would	unquestionably assure our military dominance.	4.734216979900738
9657. we would have	the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force- whether it	were fixed or mobile.	3.865684061697757
9658. with such a force of manned bombers we could bring	enormous pressure to bear on an enemy and this pressure would be	selective and extremely discriminating.	5.385204969203357
9659. no need to kill an entire city	and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance	to selectively disarm the enemy's military force.	3.4334313027880357
9660. our first	necessity at the very outset of war is post-attack reconnaissance.	6.766241087924571
9661. in a few years we will have samos	.	6.627849632018483
9662. but in the case of moving targets and targets which	have limited mobility what will their location be when it is time to	destroy them?	6.31192317444013
9663.  what targets have we successfully knocked out?	4.96134561748934
9664.  a	ballistic missile cannot today tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful.	5.915149929454275
9665. what targets still remain to be hit?	5.114023819196652
9666.  these crucial questions	must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance.	6.080690792546835
9667. samos will	be hard put to see through clouds- and to see in the dark.	4.078054843442383
9668. even if this is some day possible there remains the 30-minute time	of flight of a missile to its overseas target.	6.146432984747294
9669. if the target can change	its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in	the air on its way the probability of the missile destroying the target	is drastically reduced.	3.5209877401177776
9670. pre-attack reconnaissance is vital	but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate	the war favorably.	4.988040403281392
9671. it would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather	that post-attack reconnaissance.	4.457408504818539
9672. it could operate under the clouds	and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night.	6.009972304863099
9673. it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately	destroy any targets it discovered- no need to wait for a missile	to come all the way from the united states with the chance that	the target if it were mobile would be gone.	3.8820817418912172
9674. a large aircraft	such as the b-52 or b-70 could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small	nuclear weapons.	5.143136454510745
9675. few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive	power will create 1000 psi overpressure at 100 feet.	3.6185873307450733
9676. or	put	another way the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed	by placing a one-kiloton warhead	within 100 to 200 feet of the target!	it is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large	yield nuclear weapons.	4.663844977851898
9677. today we have side-looking radar which	has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual	buildings runways taxi-ways separate spans of bridges etc.	3.306307239140032
9678. with these keen eyes and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy	military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage	to urban areas.	5.245452066101192
9679. if we fail to develop the means to hunt down	and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision	and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace	our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening.	3.4837842260697194
9680. the lyric beauties of schubert's trout quintet-	its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies- make it a source	of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners.	4.532917433653636
9681. but for students of	musical forms and would-be classifiers the work presents its problems.	3.940581388896506
9682. since it requires only five players it would seem to fall into the	category of chamber music- yet it calls for a double bass an instrument	generally regarded as symphonic.	5.555936830104308
9683. moreover the piece is written	in five movements rather than the conventional four of most quintets	and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor.	3.603240252107744
9684. the	many and frequent performances of the trout serve to emphasize	the dual nature of its writing.	5.532602889441695
9685. some renditions are of symphonic dimensions	with the contrabass given free rein.	3.811136398809023
9686. other interpretations present	the music as an essentially intimate creation.	6.262654394115783
9687. in these readings	the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background or it	is dressed in clown's attire- the musical equivalent of a bull in	a china shop.	3.382505432292804
9688. recently i was struck anew by the divergent approaches	when in the course of one afternoon and evening i listened to no fewer	than ten different performances.	5.432966246680335
9689. the occasion for this marathon:	angel's long-awaited reissue in its great recordings of the	century series of the schnabel-pro arte version.	3.135941465553239
9690. let me say at	the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as	it did on the first.	5.645784579627667
9691. whether considered alone or in relation	to other editions colh 40 is a document of prime importance.	3.609929761007837
9692. artur schnabel was one of the greatest schubert-beethoven-mozart	players of all time and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable.	5.9522408312246595
9693. but schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great	performer and the fact that four of the ten versions i listened to	are by schnabel pupils	also sheds light on the master's pedagogical	skills.	3.8563589919185373
9694. certain pianistic traits are common to all five schnabelian	renditions most notably the schnabel trill	.	5.266463659660632
9695. but the most impressive testimony to schnabel's distinction	as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each	student's approach as distinctly his own.	3.395925402006622
9696. schnabel's emphasis	on structural clarity his innate rhythmic vibrancy and impetuous	intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one.	4.631229252735435
9697. yet no	detail was too small to receive attention from this master and as a	result the playing here has humor delicacy and radiant humanity.	3.545445249310225
9698. this	is a serious-minded interpretation but it is never strait-laced.	8.096649177603522
9699. and	although schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement it is meticulously	faithful to schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications.	3.1548779573811467
9700. the piano performance on this trout is one that really demands	a search for superlatives.	5.352048583385095
9701. about the pro arte's contribution	i am less happy.	4.734303464456284
9702. i for one rather regret that schnabel didn't	collaborate with the budapest quartet whose rugged athletic	playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook	than the style of the belgian group.	5.282474704924679
9703. from a technical standpoint	the string playing is good but the pro arte people fail to enter	into the spirit of things here.	4.058335397437068
9704. the violinist in particular is very	indulgent with swoops and slides and his tone is pinched and edgy.	4.746992326798863
9705. the twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone	but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very	quiet.	3.3124817729553686
9706. there is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation	in the forellen movement and i suspect that this is	due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original sps.	5.516234563265302
9707. turning to the more modern versions curzon's offers	the most sophisticated keyboard work.	3.9067446652361473
9708. every detail in his interpretation	has been beautifully thought out and of these i would especially	cite the delicious la^ndler touch the pianist brings to the fifth	variation	and the gossamer shading throughout.	4.860303518759179
9709. some of curzon's	playing strikes me as finicky however.	4.8327847167553815
9710. why for example does he favor	two tempos rather than one for the third movement?	6.762256121443909
9711.  the assisting	musicians from the vienna octet are somewhat lacking in expertise	but their contribution is rustic and appealing.	3.035429304715277
9712. to the double bass playing of johann krumpp: his scrawny	the glazer-fine arts edition is a model of lucidity	and organization.	5.3251459432651185
9713. it is moreover a perfectly integrated ensemble	effort.	4.424663383906454
9714. but having lived with the disc for some time now i find	the performance less exciting than either schnabel's or fleisher's	and a good deal less filled with humor than curzon's.	5.343635554396535
9715. aeschbacher's work is very much akin to schnabel's but the sound	on his decca disc is dated and you will have a hard time locating	a copy of it.	3.639341597693453
9716. the hephzibah menuhin-amadeus quartet	and victor babin-festival quartet editions	give us superlative string playing crippled	by unimaginative piano playing.	4.165143281082011
9717. badura-skoda-vienna	konzerthaus and demus-schubert quartet	are both warm-toned pleasantly lyrical	but rather slack and tensionless.	3.2923545294525036
9718. helmut roloff playing with a group	of musicians from the bayreuth ensemble gives a sturdy reading in	much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists.	5.0814950111177595
9719. telefunken	has accorded him beautiful sound and this bargain-priced disc	is worthy of consideration.	3.5682760000478253
9720. returning once again	to the schnabel reissue i am beguiled anew by the magnificence	of this pianist's musical penetration.	5.0548611433742145
9721. here is truly a great recording	of the century and its greatness is by no means diminished	by the fact that it is not quite perfect.	5.183027608482595
9722. this recording surely belongs	in everyone's collection.	6.321939137374548
9723. must records always sound like records?	4.734818154371709
9724.    from the beginning	of commercial recording new discs purported to be indistinguishable	from the real thing have regularly been put in circulation.	5.504596514428348
9725. seen	in perspective many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones.	4.183322571819011
9726. although lacking absolute verisimilitude they supply the	ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation	of the original.	5.501950739825233
9727. on the basis of what they give us we can know how the	young caruso sang appreciate the distinctive qualities of parsifal	under karl muck's baton or sense the type of ensemble toscanini	created in his years with the new york philharmonic.	3.7928877588429826
9728. since	the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago	the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold.	5.203692020296573
9729. in many	cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational	effects: the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning	as the gap between sound and substance became clearer.	3.553279100548928
9730. other	innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing	to acquire in time the status of classics.	5.234406260481537
9731. if we return to them today	we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them	still pleasing.	3.9164741386730135
9732. records sound like records because they provide	a different sort of experience than live music.	5.898436516261745
9733. this difference is	made up of many factors.	4.5139742715223505
9734. some of them are obvious such as the fact	that we associate recorded and live music with our reponses and behavior	in different types of environments and social settings.	5.721445732045789
9735. sounds best to me when i can dress informally and sit in something	from the technical standpoint	records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey	the true color texture complexity range intensity pulse and pitch	of the original.	3.0517463800404037
9736. any alteration of one of these factors is distortion	although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced	that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests.	5.929477656139783
9737. yet it is the accumulation of distortion the fitting together of	fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness	that makes records sound like records.	3.8037099847239326
9738. the sound may be good;	but if you know the real thing you know that what you are hearing	is only a clever imitation.	5.735814874748626
9739. command's new brahms second is	a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather	than a copy of one.	3.579636825789713
9740. like the recent scheherazade from london	it is successful because emphasis	has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than	on creating sensational effects.	5.059294873976992
9741. because of this only those with	truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the	engineers' triumph.	4.298207759863477
9742. the easiest way to describe this release	is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective steinberg	performance with minimal alteration of its musical values.	5.083965476592007
9743. the engineering	as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness.	3.3932702148214946
9744. the effect of	the recording is very open and natural with the frequency emphasis	exactly what you would expect from a live performance.	5.005912917458423
9745. this absence of	peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity but	it eliminates listener fatigue.	3.236615543936457
9746. a contributing factor is the perspective	the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained.	5.45053678157533
9747. the orchestra	is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes valve	clicks and other noises incidental to playing.	3.090972032909314
9748. yet you feel the orchestra	is near at hand and the individual instruments have the same firm	presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically	perfect hall.	5.656670329867711
9749. command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation.	4.488319993168129
9750. the music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its	full sonority; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer.	4.963012084279992
9751. the	timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance.	4.982750541500387
9752. all of this would be wasted of course if the performance lacked	authority and musical distinction.	7.063445946300555
9753. for me it has more of both elements	than the majority of its competitors.	4.8457683792584945
9754. steinberg seems to have gone	directly back to the score discounting tradition and has built his	performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly	what brahms set down on paper.	5.367668982476613
9755. those accustomed to broader	more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react	strongly when they hear this one.	3.8888461881344276
9756. without losing the distinctive undertow	of brahmsian rhythm the pacing is firm and the over-all performance	has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect.	4.923989984850769
9757. the presto ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is	taken literally and may shock you as the real allegro con spirito	of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet.	3.2849218188885403
9758. in the end however	the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way	it sings.	6.222571042886332
9759. steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element	which must dominate in this score and he manages at times to create	the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song.	4.027969835132719
9760. the	engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result.	6.4730031115871896
9761. too	many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody	and its accompaniment.	3.78100122919201
9762. the command technique invites you to listen	to the depth of the orchestration.	5.412678767718611
9763. your ear takes you into the ensemble	and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously	were apparent only in the score.	3.7744204649773803
9764. it is this sort of experience	that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance	for the home music listener.	6.084878830389623
9765. the first substantially complete stereo giselle	of its scope since feyer's four-sided lp edition of 1958 for	this set is i'm afraid likely to provide more horrid fascination	than enjoyment.	2.9709004234044736
9766. the already faded pastel charms of the nai^ve	music itself vanish entirely in fistoulari's melodramatic contrasts	between ultravehement brute power and chilly if suave sentimentality.	4.136073995657781
9767. and in its engineers' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic	impact and earsplitting brilliance the recording sounds as though	it had been doctored for super-high fidelity.	3.3491191308727464
9768. the home listener	is overpowered all right but the experience is a far from pleasant	one.	5.570747167643016
9769. as with the penultimate giselle release	i find the cleaner less razor-edged	monophonic	version for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness the more	aurally tolerable- but this may be the result of processing defects	in my sd copies.	3.664483802788134
9770. at the westminster kc dog show in madison square garden	new york on the second day the finals of the junior class	brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this class.	5.411196373212347

9774. it was interesting	to note that many of these juniors were showing dogs in various other	classes at the show prior to the finals of the junior class.	5.745897571112816
9775. as has been the custom for the past several years john cross	jr bench show chmn of westminster arranged for the juniors'	meeting before the class and invited two speakers from the dog	world to address them.	3.5770314011838287

9779. i know because this is my 37th year with hardly	a break.	4.26368293673747
9780. mrs long still feels the same unique spirit of westminster	which she stated the present juniors will experience today but probably	will not appreciate in full for a number of years.	5.1503427611852945
9781. twenty	years ago her daughter betsey long then 13 years of age won the	grand challenge trophy children's handling class	at westminster.	3.464612942125992
9782. no sooner had betsey come out of the	ring than mrs long walked into the working competition with	ch cadet or noranda another home-bred product and won!	speaking from long years of experience mrs long advised the juniors:	when showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement	stop! dogs have a way of sensing our feelings! when you and	your dog step into the junior ring it should be just what the dog	wants to do as much as what you want him to do.	4.834119038996246
9783. if you walk into the	ring because it is fun to show your dog he will feel it and give you	a good performance! he knows your signals what is expected of him	and the way the class is conducted right up through the flash-bulbs	of the photographers.	3.5923884815338436
9784. take	away your attitude said mrs long and what have you left?	6.14609362041308
9785. 	either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage- a sure sign	that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop! or a	bored dog because you are more interested in something else- maybe	the way you look or the date you have after the class or you are just	doing this to please the parents.	3.0316784534851284
9786. the reason you are in	the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most	attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can	produce.	4.956304542664166
9787. aids sounds more like a pony club or horsemanship classes-	riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar!   your	aids are your attitude which comes through your voice your hands	and legs- voice to encourage discourage or whatever the need may	be; hands to guide or restrain; legs to produce motion and rate of	speed.	2.9642306311451576
9788. without right attitude the other aids just do not work right.	6.329273329141072
9789. mrs long wished all the juniors luck in the class and	stated have fun! and may you all continue to show at westminster	in the years to come!	the	second speaker was harvey barcus president of the dog writers	ass'n of america.	3.541012443798845

9792. he gave a resume of	the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship.	6.024650048034048
9793. junior showmanship is an extremely worthy project and	should be earnestly encouraged! is one of mr barcus' strong	beliefs.	3.84688203842326
9794. he feels very forcibly that the american kennel club should	take a more active part in encouraging the junior division!	in closing mr barcus also wished all the juniors	luck in their class.	5.191460950011877
9795. instead of 3 am	in the past the juniors class at westminster was held at 4:45	pm.	4.305895103480425
9796. this gave the juniors the use of the entire ring at the	show- a great advantage to them!   before the juniors entered	the ring the steward announced that after all juniors had moved	their dogs around the ring and set them up they could relax with their	dogs.	5.074157535081164
9797. from there on each junior was going to be judged individually.	5.397483308172276
9798. this thoughtful gesture was well received by the juniors as the	class had an entry of 46 juniors and it took approximately one hour	45 minutes to judge the class.	5.13874697623689

9824. such a class was tried out successfully at the westchester kc	show recently.	6.187086851001575

9832. the founder of	the junior showmanship competition the late leonard brumby sr	was an outstanding	handler and believed a junior should have an opportunity to exhibit	in a dog show starting with the junior showmanship division.	4.821844942105899
9833. some years ago this class was judged by celebrities who knew	nothing of what was required of a junior's ability to show a dog.	3.7185893487167268
9834. to	overcome this unfair judging the akc requires that a licensed	handler be present to judge the class.	5.268964016168543

9849. is it that they don't care?	5.942736053817987
9850.  are they indifferent to the	fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient?	5.794330829793818
9851. 	at one time to most americans unless they were fortunate	enough to live near a body of navigable water boats were considered	the sole concern of fishermen rich people and the united states	navy.	3.47984074468385
9852. today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening	statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport.	5.476387919084302
9853. there	are more than 8000000 recreational boats in use in the united states	with almost 10000000 the prediction for within the next decade.	4.012934529269991
9854. about 40000000 people participated in boating in 1960.	6.77376476345617

9856. boats are operated in every state in the union with the heaviest	concentrations along both coasts and in the middle west.	7.0383904904087435
9857. the spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident	expectedly in the areas where boats have always been found: the natural	lakes rivers and along the nation's coastline.	3.1267229783466353
9858. but during the	last several years boats were launched in areas where a short time	ago the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for	livestock.	5.548121431313153
9859. developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources	control program of the government vast man-made bodies of water represent	a kind of glorious fringe benefit providing boating and fishing	havens all over the country.	3.7554207624901337
9860. no matter how determined or wealthy	boating lovers of the southwest had been for example they could	never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile lake	texoma located between texas and oklahoma which resulted when the	corp of army engineers dammed the red river.	4.6430571277738215
9861. in 1959 according	to the engineers lake texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial	lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1000000	persons.	3.6802977345898356
9862. where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been	created by bringing bodies of water to the people means have been found	to take the people and their boats to the water.	5.811486730025313
9863. providing these	means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1800000	boat trailers now in use.	3.427461563042976
9864. it is a simple task to haul a boat fifty	or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new light strong	easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any	kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2000.	4.726496462876723
9865. the sight of	sleek	inboards outboards and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways	many miles from any water is commonplace.	3.0043149495698684
9866. boatmen lucky enough	to have facilities for year 'round anchorage for their craft	will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car	driving to the water	and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to	the boat.	4.249740330205688
9867. today the boat on its trailer is brought to the gear and	loaded at the door.	4.326738067797553
9868. arriving at the waterside the boat is launched	the family taken aboard and that easily another day afloat is begun.	5.049544150907372
9869. and trailers for boats are not what they started out to be	ten years ago.	3.9114557062306297
9870. this year americans will discover previously unheard	of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred	of our nation's national regional and local boat shows.	5.103286847640975
9871. the boats	of america's trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as	they are hauled to new horizons.	3.0338447344803607

9884. you may dress	it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose.	5.977791563886536
9885. designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers	who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly pasadena	lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month	ride around the block to the sportiest boatman who insists on all	the dash color flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat.	3.2338526413027506
9886. you pay your money and you take your choice.	7.393270821264493
9887. american technology	in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful	interest in american boating.	3.999157944553484
9888. i wonder if anyone ever bothered	to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors americans	excel over any country in the world in the long run.	6.175750979277368
9889. russia	whose technology is not quite primitive is still in the dark ages	when it comes to improving the outboard motor for instance.	3.8430332640216056
9890. now	here is truly a marvel.	7.368236960162298
9891. the outboard engine of today has a phenomenal	range of one to 80 horsepower unheard of a few years ago for a two	cycle engine in quantity production.	3.5331162972631263
9892. these engines can be removed	from a boat with relative ease wherein lies their greatest advantage.	5.489732471738007
9893. their cost is not beyond the hopes of the american pocketbook the	range being about $150 to $1000 depending on size.	3.8152220004585806
9894. great	thought	has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population	of the country; and to making the owning of a boat simpler.	5.2117242341100924
9895. there	was a time when if a man wanted to purchase a boat it was necessary	for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he	could touch the tiller or wheel.	3.9935978806714703
9896. having a boat financed through a local	bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended.	6.156292865235651
9897. marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer	areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later.	3.3267216786615115
9898. terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down	payments run about the same as for automobiles.	6.6091138188780665
9899. of course individual	financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser's earning	power credit rating and local bank policy.	3.846272536972506
9900. outboard motors	insurance and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as	boats.	6.54298132742423
9901. terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those	for home appliances.	3.826927018099095
9902. when the automobile was in its embryonic	stage such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit	understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about	the only rule governing where when and how fast a car could go.	4.754903420601164
9903. when	air travel was in its infancy the sky was considered big enough and	high enough for all.	3.663693597275705

9905. it was	much the same with pleasure boating at first.	4.787721281713683
9906. come one come all the	water's fine!   as the ungoverned days of the automobile	and the airplane are long since relegated to the past so is the carefree	attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do; must and should	do.	4.851604618499356
9907. however there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating.	5.444629284747769
9908. laws on boating vary according to the state in which the	craft is to be used and according to its horsepower.	7.50445298332358
9909. what may be acceptable	in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line.	3.848885465932661
9910. the main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according	to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally	used.	7.140902912040835
9911. if your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure	boats you must apply for a number from the us coast guard for	any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower	before it can be used on federal waterways.	3.7587218374102798
9912. state numbering	laws differ from each other in many ways.	7.590058739750043
9913. fees are not the	same	and some states do not require certain craft such as sailboats with	no power to be registered at all.	3.416005726386758
9914. many states have laws regulating	the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age	of motor boat operators.	5.354005145074557
9915. generally states reserve for communities	the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities.	3.854338374749395
9916. it is always wise to consult your marine dealer local yacht	or boat club secretary or local law enforcement officers if you are	not positive what the regulations are.	4.883857925894788
9917. ignorance of the law is no better	excuse on the water than it is on land; lack of ability and common	sense can lead to just as much tragedy.	4.017169781695887
9918. hand in hand with	the legislative program is the industry's self originated and directed	safety program.	5.702094837590371
9919. foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the	rapid growth of the sport the industry has been supporting an intense	coordinated educational program with great success since 1947.	3.359476765900246
9920. a primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the	enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers.	6.715181977539102
9921. the industry	has been its own watch dog.	3.834255907880378
9922. with us coast guard cooperation	the american boat and yacht council was formed to develop recommended	practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference	to safety.	5.279187530087124
9923. industry interest in safety goes even farther.	4.562433287322891
9924. in 1959 the yacht safety bureau was reorganized by the national	association of engine and boat manufacturers and a group of insurance	underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service	for boats and their equipment.	5.349708706134997
9925. a new waterfront site for the bureau	is now being built at atlantic city new jersey to provide the	most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the	sport safe.	3.2580876140255084
9926. in addition to these activities the naebm	with headquarters at 420 lexington avenue new york city as well	as other associations and individual manufacturers provide and distribute	films booklets and public services in regard to proper boat handling	and safety afloat.	5.081508270236431
9927. it is important to note the work of	the united states power squadrons and the us coast guard	auxiliary.	4.419266645180473
9928. each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in	seamanship piloting and small boat handling.	5.828448344301441
9929. these are not governmentally	subsidized organizations.	5.916093923947824
9930. this year over 100000 persons will	receive this free instruction.	6.560753818696078
9931. as america on wheels was responsible	for an industry of motor courts motels and drive-in establishments	where you can dine see a movie shop or make a bank deposit	the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries	designed especially to accommodate them.	2.9437496185684573
9932. instead of motels for	the boatman there are marinas.	6.985862188389939
9933. the word marina was coined by	naebm originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational	boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative	comfort.	3.099382056278913
9934. currently marina is used to indicate a municipal or	commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and findsome	or all of the following available: gasoline fresh water electricity	telephone service ice repair facilities restaurants sleeping	accommodations a general store and a grocery store.	4.766373530046703
9935. yachtel	a relatively new word indicates a waterfront type of hotel where	a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises	as well as other services.	3.215259464581382
9936. boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel.	6.450564689154938
9937. it indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically	to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as	outboards.	3.9019510019686425
9938. regardless of nomenclature yachtels and boatels are marinas.	6.112528909484612
9939. boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities	may rightfully be called marinas.	4.303683754797055
9940. a recent survey disclosed there	are about 4000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and	boatyards in the united states the majority of which are equipped	to handle outboard boats.	5.577713393900926
9941. the design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical	puzzle but once understood the principles can be applied to	any track and signal arrangement.	3.4258799358908045
9942. in the frame are two sets of bars	which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous	moves.	6.379566444632489
9943. the main set of bars are the tappets and one tappet	is connected to each lever.	3.5994627049254366
9944. if the lever is pulled to clear a signal	or move a switch the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at	the same time.	5.399100364044488
9945. close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking	bars.	4.825191990273804
9946. these can also move a short distance but at right angles	to the tappets.	6.218601009496681
9947. the number of locking bars required depends on how many	false moves must be prevented.	3.7760658224169266
9948. in the sides of the tappets	are notches with sloping sides and connection between the tappets and	locking bars consist of cams called dogs.	5.172285778096313
9949. two or more dogs are	mounted on each locking bar.	4.957231445390076
9950. these slide into and out of the notches	in the tappets as the tappets are moved locking and unlocking them.	5.897696081110739
9951. here's how the scheme works: suppose the operator pulls	the lever to clear a particular signal.	3.6313178079511106
9952. this also pulls the tappet connected	to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches	to the side thus moving one or more locking bars.	4.848669896450577
9953. the dogs on the	other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other	tappets.	3.539712756504727
9954. by this scheme pulling one signal to clear locks all the	other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal	is again restored to normal.	4.946490421020902
9955. interlocking signals are normally	at stop or red position and a lever must be pulled to clear	the signal.	3.4219686563719556
9956. this is not necessarily to green however for in	some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it	into the plant.	5.581807252761555
9957. there are other basic rules.	6.065173517246865
9958. a turnout	may have two levers one to actually move the switch points the other	to lock the points.	5.005215853824241
9959. a signal cannot be cleared until all the related	turnouts are properly thrown and locked.	3.57546915951343
9960. such locks are nearly	always used where the switch points face oncoming traffic.	6.012518529739621
9961. the	lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that	a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point.	3.5605223787853117
9962. if the points aren't	thrown all the way the turnout cannot be locked and in turn	the signal cannot be cleared.	6.215384753005358
9963. generally these locks on turnouts are	called facing point locks.	4.096357378235583
9964. figs 1-6 show typical arrangements	of track and signals.	6.008557251303244
9965. each diagram is accompanied by a dog	chart a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular	lever will lock if pulled.	3.6095994326073937
9966. the lines connecting the wedge-shaped	dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars.	4.931986487543452
9967. by studying the track-signal diagrams you'll note several	other details.	4.073992928258149
9968. derails- mechanical track devices that actually guide	the wheels off the rails if a train passes a stop signal- are	used in many instances.	4.705715237345916
9969. home signals have two blades.	5.495552499131051
9970. the blacked-in	blades indicate a fixed aspect- the blade does not move.	4.882746025682841
9971. as	an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal	is seen in advance when he passes the distant signal located	beyond the limits of the interlocking plant.	3.6295781142876486
9972. in some low-speed situations	the distant signal is fixed at caution.	6.351073364492857
9973. in other instances where	there is no automatic block signaling the distant has only green	and yellow aspects.	3.6923264167966665
9974. so much for the prototype.	8.79867585942491
9975. the interlocking	frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then	installed on paul larson's railroad follows the fig 1 scheme	and is shown beginning in fig 7 page 65 and in the photos.	3.1944417220508967
9976. here's	how it can be built.	8.637018234329686
9977. the sizes of pieces needed	for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within fig 7 most	of the bars being 18'' brass in 14'' and 12'' widths.	2.9765195732254526
9978. you may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers	and locks as you wish.	5.543242971107556
9979. our instructions assume you are building	this particular frame which is for a junction.	4.0625682026566565
9980. when cutting	the pieces dress the ends smooth and square with a smooth file or sanding	disk.	5.749090694572204
9981. start with the right-hand piece b f soldering	it to the lower piece a of the same material but 12''	long.	4.099428111571981
9982. let exactly 1'' of a extend beyond b and	use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees.	5.256336938863235
9983. now	lay 12 pieces of f cut 5-34'' long side by side but separated	by 12 pieces of the same material 12'' sq.	3.9625937049287523
9984. this gives you the	spacing for locating the left-hand piece b.	6.24244390878833
9985. compress the assembly	when you make the mark to show the location for b.	3.8924127846658716
9986. solder	this second b to a at right angles.	6.227157046387671
9987. there	should be 10'' between the two parallel members and each should be	1'' from an end of the long piece.	4.2126821911143875
9988. cap this assembly	with a f bar.	7.046672655308522
9989. tack-solder all the 12''	sq pieces to the 10'' and 12'' members.	3.6231623423744717
9990. these will be drilled	and tapped later on.	6.906328934783833
9991. now cut five f locking bar spacers	.	5.042605791260875
9992. position these using six intermediate temporary	f spacers and locate the upper 12'' bar a.	5.126168127897273
9993. solder	it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame.	4.221799204463741
9994. now place 12 pieces	12'' sq on this edge as we did before and space them with	the 5-34'' long tappets as they are called.	5.386377572002173
9995. cap with a f	bar and tack-solder in place.	4.237987369762851
9996. cap the locking bar spacers with two	f directly under the first two b pieces.	6.49621102148166
9997. remove all the	loose spacing bars.	5.2867874827664165
9998. mark and center-punch all the holes required	for screws to hold this assembly together.	5.661304076208062
9999. placement	of these holes is not critical but they should be located so that	the centers are about 18'' from any edge.	3.502643491919464
10000. drill all no 50 and	counter-drill all except the a pieces size 43.	6.136082676358049
10001. tap the a	pieces 2-56.	5.430735917531786
10002. now unsolder and disassemble the frame	except for the two 12'' and the first two 3-34'' bars	which are soldered together.	5.906430914540203
10003. either lay	the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters	so they may be replaced in their proper positions.	3.7158926163666015
10004. dress all surfaces	with a file cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs.	5.274282389576026
10005. drill 20 no 47 holes in the upper piece a as shown in	fig 7.	4.179057034793561
10006. tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later	on.	6.043669355171045
10007. note 6 and 8 lock levers don't require holes for contacts.	4.1594419617852365
10008. now reassemble the frame using f roundhead steel screws and nuts.	5.902985524057526
10009. put the 12 tappets and some f locking bar spacers in the frame to	help align all the components before you tighten the screws.	3.8390139631811095
10010. be sure	the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 12'' sq spacer.	6.016081821418971
10011. as	an anchor for the spring lock insert a f bar in the lower left corner	of the frame as shown in fig 7.	3.7465781946628662
10012. drill a no 43 hole through	the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw.	5.49936761584772
10013. drill two no 50	holes one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly	above it and tap 2-56.	4.0762329397013115
10014. number all the tappet bars before removing them	so they can be replaced in the same slots.	6.608137026486459
10015. remove all other loose	pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth.	4.550277243401457
10016. cut five pieces	of f brass bar stock 3-34'' long.	6.296364986926757
10017. these are supporting members	for the short locking bars.	4.586529555212397
10018. locate their positions in fig 7 and	drill no 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame.	6.100641850888244
10019. cut off	excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut.	4.001977608855945
10020. drill	four no 19 and four no 28 holes in the 12'' long a	pieces.	5.620597497367505
10021. locate the position from fig 7.	4.7957287256519
10022. bars	draw-file no 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective	slot and square the ends.	5.405604575688895
10023. break the end corners with a slight 45 degree	chamfer.	4.380481754493279
10024. drill a no 50 hole 1-14'' from one end and tap	2-56.	6.59228019218643
10025. put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole cut	off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar.	3.6515026675450315
10026. to find the other stop screw position insert the tappet into the frame	and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge.	5.624986220959384
10027. scribe a line	across the bar on the other end of the tappet 14'' plus half the	diameter of the 2-56 screw head away from the frame	edge.	4.074285508912636
10028. total distance is about 2164''.	7.6264708119103775
10029. tend to make this dimension	slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly	14'' tappet movement.	3.724725417044747
10030. drill a no 50 hole tap 2-56 and insert	a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end.	5.468035007582077
10031. drill a no	47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in	figs	7 and 8.	3.7392102956052757
10032. repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet	bars.	6.410277018967136
10033. to each tappet except 6 and 8 solder a f piece of	brass and file to the tapered shape shown in figs 6 and 8.	3.468520861388757
10034. these	will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts.	6.165823312213227
10035. fitting	the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job	since stop screws tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced	many times.	3.5108125026969303
10036. as the work progresses the frame and moving parts become	a sort of chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before	the part you are working on is accessible.	5.0952936946417084
10037. a little extra work	here will pay off with a smooth snug-fitting machine when you are finished.	4.130593869871961
10038. each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work	progresses to insure snug fitting.	5.681912677420875
10039. the order of fitting is not	too important.	4.3918849016956445
10040. however we started with the first row of bars and worked	our way back.	6.451032519571668
10041. since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs	and notches is used throughout we will only describe the construction	of one locking bar.	3.4478026684234644
10042. figs 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions.	6.56325712913717
10043. all the bars are cut from f brass.	5.387235553719604
10044. the lengths of each piece are	listed at the bottom of fig 7.	5.456084315466974
10045. bar c is 2-34'' long.	4.569070126826611
10046. draw-file the edges square up the ends and put a slight chamfer	on the edges so they will not snag in the frame.	5.411690817330959
10047. fig 8 gives	the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes.	4.032888255613549
10048. center-punch and drill	the no 31 hole 716'' from one end of the bar.	6.3120524824574735
10049. chuck a length	of 18'' dia drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning	device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file	a slight taper 18'' long.	3.1765365791147833
10050. cut the piece about 932'' or 516''	long and drive it into the no 31 hole drilled in the locking	bar.	5.857005653283646
10051. file the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 18''	above the bar.	4.377226969939084
10052. this dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3.	5.6883874247210855
10053. place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3.	4.606515414332284
10054. scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of	tappet 3 parallel to piece a.	6.141076271513747
10055. see the drawings for the shape	of the notch.	4.782647396403691
10056. scribe v-shaped lines on the bar and rough out	with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool.	5.130160252588251
10057. we used	the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about .	4.204948616049445
10058. 020'' thick and	1'' dia fitted on a 18'' dia mandrel.	5.385860840370278
10059. such disks are	very handy for cutting and shaping small parts.	4.103879825559951
10060. file to a smooth finish.	8.441120061185957
10061. a barrette swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular	shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without	marring an adjoining one.	3.126490538718133
10062. endeavor to get the notches as much alike	as possible.	6.8862608845094
10063. the notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel	dog will slide easily over it.	3.826727870500497
10064. assemble the parts in the frame and	test the sliding action of the mating pieces.	5.657249525234392
10065. all matching surfaces	should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis.	3.729408110635353
10066. chuck a 2'' or 3'' piece of 18'' dia drill rod in a	drill press or	electric hand tool.	4.9564733626986035
10067. fashion a sharp scribing point about 364''	long on one end using swiss pattern files.	3.6554271827511555
10068. this tool can also be	made with a lathe.	6.269781040247698
10069. scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on	mathematics.	5.425154283159347
10070. without math the men who are continually seeking the causes	of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round	would not have any means of analyzing standardizing and communicating	the things they discover and learn.	5.515057196843181
10071. math and the formulas that	allow it to be applied to different problems are therefore essential	to any scientific endeavor.	3.8593457249669014
10072. hot rodding is a science.	7.166579203865631
10073. it's	not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate	on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit	but it is nevertheless a science.	3.1029207358098727
10074. but because science is based on mathematics	doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician.	6.189251373195125
10075. a guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years	without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems;	however he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and	the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few	formulas that apply to rodding.	3.320561328965858
10076. a mathematical formula is nothing	more than a pattern for solving a specific problem.	5.475364143796647
10077. it places the	various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation	to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can	be computed.	4.285267911713653
10078. the first step in using a formula is to insert the	numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions	in the formula.	5.792974561394018
10079. this changes the formula to an equation.	4.6705380169541675
10080. the	equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem.	6.39130775026028
10081. equations for rodding formulas are not complicated.	4.313811528742339
10082. they involve	only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic	classes.	5.702264644537193
10083. however it is essential that the various mathematical symbols	used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes	can be done properly and in their correct order.	3.9744167513718054
10084. they indicate	simple division multiplication subtraction and addition.	6.635544993656807
10085. the	symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers	placed one above the other.	3.606965646340503
10086. the lower number is always divided into the	upper number: f   the symbol for multiplication is .	4.9186514216793835
10087. it is used to separate two or more numbers in a row.	4.904613396049134
10088. for example:	f numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any	order.	5.9229267553785805
10089. the result will be the same regardless of the order used.	5.389989690546635
10090. the symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign.	5.784977393651941
10091. this is	nothing more than a dash.	5.569919830889029
10092. it separates two or more numbers.	9.044544647119109
10093. the number	on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on	the left of the symbol.	3.8338533898255824
10094. for example: f when more than two figures	are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried	out from the left to right if the result is to be correct.	5.725414391610655
10095. for example	for the problem f 10 from 25 equals 15 then 6 from 15 equals	9.	3.5418242171436263
10096. addition is indicated by the + symbol.	6.730902223911635
10097. the symbol is	used to separate two or more numbers.	4.026119770001907
10098. for example: f numbers separated	by addition symbols may be placed in any order.	5.91549502647824
10099. when solving	an equation that involves division as well as other steps do all	the division steps first	to reduce those parts of the equation to their	numerical value.	3.8455770506222993
10100. multiplication subtraction and addition can then	be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left	end of the equation and working toward the right.	5.181223313888579
10101. completing the	division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication	subtraction or addition steps: f this would be reduced	by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12.	3.191023823296559
10102. this part	of the equation would then become 4.	6.640641490302372
10103. for use in formulas fractions	should be converted to their decimal equivalents.	4.614631192048091
10104. the easiest	way to do this is with a conversion chart.	6.001538288067875
10105. charts for this purpose	are available from many sources.	4.2091389592099615
10106. they are included in all types of mathematical	handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision	measuring instruments.	5.8941571875289736
10107. the various mathematical processes can	be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places.	3.5436835906063586
10108. shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental	effect on the accuracy of the final result.	6.1723963414537675
10109. a constant is a number that remains the same	regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant	equation.	4.469195550447031
10110. it is a number without which the equation cannot be solved	correctly.	6.878333700506504
10111. rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport.	4.499089344947154
10112. the answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases	and	quite often are necessary for completing entry blanks for different	events.	5.079680914587171
10113. when it is needed one formula is as important as another.	5.8412807068018475
10114. however some formulas are used more than others.	7.078259463808916
10115. we'll take	them in the general order of their popularity.	4.777901799013696
10116. a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine.	6.41104328772496
10117. displacement is sometimes referred to as swept volume.	4.382310621477346
10118. most	entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information	because of class restrictions.	5.140047013898787
10119. it is good to be able to compute	displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking	can be computed.	3.87441038422978
10120. factors involved in the displacement formula	are the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders the length of the	piston stroke the number of cylinders in the engine and a constant.	5.620490887733781
10121. 7854 which is one-quarter of 3.	4.403285903274782
10122. 1416 another constant	known as pi.	6.655014167372593
10123. pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions	of circles.	4.858327449958538
10124. actually the engine displacement formula is	the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type	with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the	engine.	5.56165516715858
10125. the cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and	then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying	the area by the stroke length which is the equivalent of the length	of the cylinders.	3.581533100938461
10126. multiplying the result by the number of cylinders	in the engine gives the engine's total displacement.	5.901146182642978
10127. dimensions in inches and fractions of inches will give	the displacement in cubic inches.	3.6749807179499734
10128. dimensions in centimeters and fractions	of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters	.	5.817511797321628
10129. 54 centimeters: one cubic inch equals 16.	4.090616115878263
10130. for example let's consider a standard	283 cubic inch chevy v8.	6.3294258612753485
10131. these engines have a cylinder diameter	of 3-78 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches.	3.862026638802685
10132. the formula with	the fractions converted to decimals becomes f.	5.062572354287626
10133. to arrive	at the answer multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of	the group and working to the right.	3.9097972743102867
10134. the different steps will look like	this: f	a cylinder's compression ratio	is computed by comparing the cylinder's volume or its displacement	with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber.	4.579647943135898
10135. cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber	volume must be measured with a liquid.	3.7385883079636315
10136. cylinder volume is	determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula:	f.	6.60201870025875
10137. to measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers	in the cylinder head install the valves and spark plug in the chamber	and support the head so that its gasket surface is level.	3.8690259881610123
10138. then pour	water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill	the chamber to its gasket surface.	5.362796058582343
10139. do not overfill the chamber.	5.917258111695485
10140. this	is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension.	6.579700261380987
10141. such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface	around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber.	4.2067059805969755
10142. the amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting	the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from	the original quantity.	5.487434592978936
10143. most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters	making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches.	4.010631528745277
10144. however the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic	centimeters.	8.063113707786616
10145. the compression ratio arrived at with the formula will	be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are	used.	3.2912271181026567
10146. the only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be	quoted in the same terms.	6.580409451159957
10147. the volume of the cylinder opening	in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square	inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch.	3.215000927069197
10148. sometimes	it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening	but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy	that it won't affect the final computation.	4.890214073411128
10149. the volume of the opening	is added to the combustion chamber volume.	4.33186516586123
10150. another thing	that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between	the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston	is in top dead center position.	6.528592829659478
10151. compute this volume by measuring	the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately	as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring	device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth.	3.5901409206609167
10152. the	formula for this step is: f this volume is added to the total volume	of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening.	5.549587518312857
10153. the total of	these three volumes is the final combustion chamber volume.	3.69557302223915
10154. after the factors just described have been computed they are applied	to the following formula: f   for an example let's dream	up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic	inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches.	4.845288537159598
10155. applying these figures	to the formula we get the equation: f the compression ratio is	10 to 1.	3.561919715413097
10156. this method of computing compression ratio cannot be	used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly	shaped heads.	4.756087881797941
10157. any irregularity on the piston heads will make	it impossible with normal means to determine the final combustion	chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot	be readily computed.	3.410461648217662
10158. the only way to determine the final combustion	chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid	while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston	is in top dead center position.	5.01429172530433
10159. there are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships	of car speed engine speed rear axle gear ratio and rear tire	size.	3.7745980625059077
10160. by using the appropriate version any one of these factors can	be determined for any combination of the other three.	7.086845738421068
10161. to simplify	the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of	the factors.	4.029858945375433
10162. these are   mph for car speed   rpm	for engine crankshaft speed   r for rear axle gear ratio	w for tire size   tire size can be determined in	several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is	by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly.	4.84590048104728
10163. this	is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire	is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft.	4.345021821004317
10164. a tire must be inflated	to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to	its operating weight when this measurement is made.	4.671335861653816
10165. the measurement	must be in inches.	4.230342437734289
10166. any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement	must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics.	6.10619941787517
10167. when tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used	in the formula.	3.887560848642431
10168. to determine car speed for a given combination	of engine speed gear ratio and tire size the formula is: f	for an engine speed of 5000 rpm a gear ratio of 4.	4.994528975578824
10169. 00 to 1 and a	tire radius of 13 inches the equation would look like this: f	to determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three	factors the formula is: f using the same figures as for the	previous example the equation becomes: f   to determine the	rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors the	formula is: f using the figures from the previous examples the	equation becomes: f	- the best 2-year-old pacing mile up	to date at ben white raceway has been that of mary liner	a member of the dick williams stable who was	clocked 2:25.	3.152636431313757
10170. she is owned by ralph h kroening milwaukee	wis who according to the railbirds can feel justly proud of her.	5.670354241909212

10178. fury and caper worked in 2:35h and did	it with ease.	5.799561674425481
10179. they are two good colts of different type.	4.844202857075442
10180. fury is	upstanding and on the rangy side and caper is more the compact type.	6.233633869302249
10181. i have never seen caper off his feet- he seems to know nothing but	'trot' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so.	3.6975319750440336
10182. fury	has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect with his	impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground.	4.991388670205968
10183. trackdown has worked a mile in 2:33.	4.804340105805622
10184. it took this colt several weeks to strike a pace.	6.962663572972562
10185. then after	emasculation he was eased up for a couple of weeks.	5.084610429048244

10245. she hesitated she hopped	she roll and rocked skipped and jumped but in some two weeks she	started to pace from that time to this she has shown steady improvement	and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds.	3.33691330838618

10281. the average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun	but he's always on the lookout for new and	better arms.	3.330377003894042
10282. he's more than a reader of outdoor articles; he's	a real hunter and shooter eager to improve his sport.	5.615107831140634
10283. well if you're	that kind of sportsman we're here to help you.	4.1777902157876206
10284. you've probably	given a lot of christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack	but it's not easy to decide on a new one.	5.5199421702799905
10285. you still have time to	drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most; the time	to decide on them is now.	3.527978485042591
10286. as a christmas service i've taken a close	look at this year's crop of new models.	5.623738875640215
10287. here they are with my	comments and judgments.	5.226539581286124
10288. read on take your pick- and start dropping	those hints.	6.053351024217157
10289. first on my own list would be two arms- a rifle	and a handgun- that qualify as new in the strictest sense.	3.459218082371763
10290. for me a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute	a truly new design.	5.5502226620616435
10291. such modifications are all for the best but	it takes something as different as a deerstalker or a jet to change	arms-making concepts.	3.6578924817219645
10292. bill ruger's long-awaited deerstalker	is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the	modern theory of high-velocity fans; it's a short light quick-handling	fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug	at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for	our most popular big game- whitetail.	4.290503191029256
10293. ruger reports that	on his recent african safari the little .	3.8516113842449142
10294. 44 magnum cartridge was a	real work horse.	6.327508502504363
10295. small antelope were generally grassed with one shot	and the .	3.9636065347043816
10296. 44 magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck kob and wart hog with	deadly efficiency; these are fairly large tough animals.	4.694719184958136
10297. the deadliness of the .	3.9475653627774125
10298. 44 magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to	me.	5.947571415706518
10299. at least five years ago tom robinson of marlin made up an overunder	double rifle for me in this caliber using the now defunct model	90 action in 20-gauge size.	3.6856728042661313
10300. after figuring out how to regulate the	barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact we fired this	little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in marlin's underground	test gallery.	5.341740531815943
10301. we quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued bill	ruger in his first experiments: three or four bullets would be	placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then unaccountably	one could stray far out of the group.	3.5040186264362987
10302. ruger learned that this	was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting	the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet.	5.3936404814263
10303. the new jacketed slug	in .	4.684644189356715
10304. but even without jacketed bullets i	had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt	that first year.	5.37029798395189
10305. within half an hour i jumped a six-point buck that	hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket and i caught him just behind	the left foreleg at 60 yards.	3.32131296502737
10306. he moved only about 30 feet after	the 240-grain slug hit him- and this was after the bullet had passed	through a sapling.	5.173149146228818
10307. three more deer have fallen to this same	gun and all were one-shot kills.	3.974460416253338
10308. my double was made with standard-weight	revolver barrels and although	it compares well in other respects it's considerably heavier than	the deerstalker which only scales about 6-12 pounds.	4.672358607217334
10309. if ever	a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter this is it.	4.332315089502978
10310. the deerstalker	points with the ease speed and precision of a fine imported	double shotgun and its trigger pull is light and sharp.	4.668168340097914
10311. the 240-grain	bullet leaves the muzzle at 1850 fps which gives it all the smash	needed at woods ranges.	3.1936851927298124
10312. with five shots at the immediate command	of the hunter's trigger finger the gun and load are a deadly combination.	5.265328089688786
10313. the second really new development this year was a revolver	handling a different sort of varmint load- the .	3.493253966568465
10314. 22 remington jet	magnum center fire.	7.880531163776065
10315. at present it's available in one model the	fine and familiar smith + wesson magnum revolver	long a top-quality handgun among target arms.	3.343496481047584
10316. the velocity of this .	6.554877570620494
10317. 22-caliber	40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2460 fps and it's	the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge with a mid-range	rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range.	3.0670917479843616
10318. this is a varmint load	pure and simple; it's much too explosive for small edible game.	5.428313483975485
10319. it can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry	of feathers.	3.885422057967044
10320. the most intriguing aspect of the s+w magnum	chambered for the new jet is that it can also fire standard .	6.466721969851044
10321. 22 rim-fires	by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers.	4.349826994017207
10322. you may therefore	convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm although the difference	in the point of impact can be somewhat disconcerting.	5.587614814986805
10323. the accuracy of the jet cartridge is fine; i tested	it in my scoped s+w and it was good enough to allow me to hit a	chuck with every shot at 100 yards if i did my part by holding the handgun	steadily.	3.213079852229303
10324. the fact that the deerstalker	and the jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't	mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models actions and calibers.	5.139767936029202
10325. aside from the ruger carbine a number of hunting rifles have been	introduced for the first time.	4.488345053912863
10326. here are the brands	and the new models.	7.881083643326689
10327. newcomers to the american hunter	are the browning group of bolt-action high-power rifles.	4.051852089337295
10328. they have	fine fn actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal	and the stock wood.	5.357479090051669
10329. barrel weights vary sensibly with the various	calibers available and these include the standard bores	plus the magnums; the latter include the .	3.2845292090535865
10330. shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard	on all of the magnums except the .	6.075041799053267
10331. stock designs are excellent	for use with scopes.	4.464715322593948
10332. colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are	all made with sako actions regardless of caliber.	5.191145135662671
10333. 222's have	the short action; the .	4.198630456393398
10334. 308 the medium action and the .	6.622356312327139
10335. 270	f and the magnums the long action	.	4.604783678420862
10336. previously fn actions	were used for the larger cartridges.	7.427082338527031
10337. high standard has	introduced a .	5.4257114570255585
10338. 22 auto the sport-king in two grades- field and special	.	6.209415795925155
10339. it's a streamlined	rifle fast and well-made.	4.549474762084205
10340. 22 magnum rim-fire	rifles 1961's lone newcomer was the kodiak model 260 autoloader	.	5.530274906960033
10341. previously known as jefferson arms kodiak has given	this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design and the	260 is the first autoloader to handle .	3.285960685793017
10342. marlin	has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings.	6.130343996834124
10343. the	model 99 is a light-weight streamlined .	4.095437217925984
10344. 22 rim-fire auto	with a tubular magazine that holds 18 long rifles.	5.956847070111516
10345. it's extremely	accurate for an auto and the test rifle i tried was completely	trouble-free in functioning.	3.474480260902589
10346. the 989 is an even newer .	5.757573373231336
10347. 22	auto this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip.	3.9740061520972794
10348. once again the	mossberg targo outfit has appeared but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun	combination.	6.197593103231467
10349. the bore is unrifled but is provided with an	insert tube which is rifled and which surprisingly gives pretty fair	accuracy even though it's only 3-12 inches long.	2.9173336195302273
10350. you can unscrew	this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with .	6.391237536346514
10351. 22 shotshells-	to break the little targo clay targets.	4.576885086245169
10352. a trap for throwing	these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can	throw his own targets.	5.2215017538824515
10353. a spring trap for solid mounting and a regular	hand trap are also available.	3.5822092241105272
10354. you can have your choice of a seven-shot	repeater the 340tr or a single-shot the 320tr	.	6.182113183556895
10355. the targo is a good outfit for fun shooting	or for economic wing-shooting practice but it's tougher than it looks	to run up a score on the clay birds.	3.234753246211117
10356. they'll travel 50 feet or	more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to	break one after it passes the 35-foot mark.	4.717184657124177
10357. the combination of thin	pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds	right now!   big magnum calibers appeared in the remington line	for 1961 with the addition of the .	3.423277526911811
10358. 375 and .	8.213868925581965
10359. 458 to the list of model	725's.	5.476068684699428
10360. these are made on special order only in kodiak grade	with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads;	they weigh around nine pounds.	4.88789185468536
10361. a shortened version of the	highly regarded remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961.	3.3818190414061315
10362. this	carbine has an 18-12-inch	barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's	model 760 pump with a short-barrel.	5.4771288711022414
10363. this design is hard to beat	for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard.	3.778307882216623
10364. presently	the 742c is available in f.	6.715480541668294
10365. the latest versions of the famous	savage model 99 are the 99 featherweight and the	99 deluxe which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger	design.	3.150839784066968
10366. the replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will	make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new	safety is easier and faster to operate.	4.559888387908706
10367. a fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961 and they're	good bets for your christmas gift list if you're wondering what to	get for a youngster.	3.0726783138116964
10368. the most unusual of them is the ithaca 49	- a lever-action single-shot patterned	after the famous winchester lever-action and featuring the western	look.	4.847047697034662
10369. because of its traditional lines it probably has more kid	appeal than any other model.	4.597801124806937
10370. the action is a drop-block handling all	the standard .	5.537600405399102
10371. marlin's latest is also designed	for the beginning shooter although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty	of barrel weight and ample stock.	3.1770216277712344
10372. this is the model 122	; it's a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety-	ie the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun	cocked for the next shot.	5.1955621702160455
10373. stock design is excellent and this model	is a good first gun.	4.094339975095736
10374. another boy's model is the .	7.333295541076115
10375. 22 single-shot remington	514c which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a	short- 12-12-inch- stock; it's just right for a boy of 12-12.	3.449658658663296
10376. a beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this year.	5.751731202995998
10377. the single-barrel stevens 940y is made with a side lever	rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren't strong	enough to operate a top tang to open a gun- and the side lever does	indeed open very easily.	3.0242915482191175
10378. this gun has a 12-12-inch stock and is	available in either 20 or .	5.333493959335007
10379. there's another addition to	the stevens line the pump-action model 77 in .	3.44037345473201
10380. 410 which	you may or may not consider a kid's gun; many experienced hunters	like this gauge and type of scattergun too.	4.824125508683686
10381. although	there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year	a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit	the market.	3.348771494835854
10382. for example a browning trap version of the superposed	overunder the broadway differs	from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore	end a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast	sighting.	5.302017510017418
10383. the colt line now includes a new scattergun the standard	or custom pump model in	12 16 and 20.	3.0015348655248717
10384. firearms international has introduced another	import this one from finland.	6.087699281758196
10385. it's the valmet a 12-gauge	overunder very much like the old remington 32- which was	so fine	a gun that today a used one still brings high prices.	3.1892813370889983
10386. high	standard has also added two models to its line.	6.061707969316978
10387. the supermatic trophy	is a 12-gauge auto.	3.5606253319926933
10388. the flite-king trophy	is a pump gun in 12 or 16.	4.928420548628235
10389. either model is a very good	dollar value.	5.342113239528912
10390. mossberg's latest contribution to the field is	the model 500; this is an improved version of the old	model 200 a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun.	5.658525342826761

10912. the 80-hp motor drives	her at 25 mph with six aboard!   with only two aboard hotei	does better than 27	mph- and she gives a comfortable ride at this	speed even in a three-foot chop.	4.360825923478936
10913. she also banks into a turn like	a fine runabout- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all	over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser.	3.647295455971277
10914. nor is she a wet boat.	8.160870717760195
10915. we've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry.	4.011179582839761

10921. the well itself is designed to take two	merc 800's or 500's if you wish and there's room for a 25-gallon	long-cruise gas tank below it.	3.3525960332158045
10922. needless to say you can't	build hotei in a couple of weeks.	6.312647497220629
10923. our building time was slightly	over 400 hours- but the total cost for the hull with fiberglas bottom	sink head and hardware was under $800.	3.5938160775792056
10924. a comparable manufactured	boat would cost close to $3000.	6.041207346226242
10925. consider what you have to earn to be	able to spend the $3000 and your building time is well worth it.	4.252767005456507
10926. a	gator trailer model 565 is used to transport the boat to the waterways.	5.762710700184522
10927. this piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save	you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years.	3.901862723955009
10928. all framing	in hotei is one-inch mahogany which in the dressed state you	buy it is about the 1316-inch thickness specified in the drawings.	5.431141629512352
10929. therefore	the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens	etc on a table saw.	3.469674694220395
10930. besides flathead bronze screws silicon bronze	stronghold nails	are used extensively in assembly and weldwood	resorcinal glue is used in all the joints.	5.558432278362442
10931. follows a thorough study of the drawings.	5.3325219017371595
10932. start by laying out the six	frames and the transom on a level floor.	6.258317440703999
10933. draw each outline in a different-color	chalk one on top of the other.	4.36657703516789
10934. in this way you will be	able to detect any obvious mistakes.	6.758262209813842
10935. the transom frame is made	first with the joints lapped glued and fastened with one-inch no	12 stronghold nails.	3.0765806963462357
10936. after notching it for the keelson chines and	battens the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue	and the same type	nails.	5.47687968283442
10937. all frames are butted at the joints and 38-inch plywood gussets	are glued and nailed on each side of each joint again using the one-inch	no 12 nails.	3.4775207091752036
10938. the frames are notched only for the keelson	and the chines.	5.633195274087382
10939. if notched for the battens they would require more work	be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge	water could flow through.	3.8417626029695087
10940. nowhere in the boat do the frames come in	contact with the plywood planking.	5.857287868920382
10941. the jig is erected after the	frames and transom are complete.	3.342191488637774
10942. this is an important step because	any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull	as you advance in construction.	5.29367707585643
10943. be sure all members are parallel	vertical and level as required.	4.39929638215849
10944. after the frames and transom	are set up on the jig and temporarily braced a piece of three-inch-wide	mahogany	is butted between frames one and two below the line	of the keelson.	5.704683200241422
10945. the frames are glued and screwed to this piece.	4.048999442921671
10946. the	joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated	fiberglas cloth and nailed.	5.487015623798372
10947. it is over this piece that the	laminated stem and keelson are spliced.	3.8915215796378373
10948. the keelson made of	two three-inch widths is next installed.	5.069647615695472
10949. the first piece is glued	and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames	one and two.	3.68867853463489
10950. the second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the	first.	6.350307759744297
10951. note however that it is six inches shorter at the forward end.	4.9223439457792235
10952. one-inch no 10 screws are used in both cases.	6.748637105888532
10953. a stem	jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to	frame one.	3.615991118339192
10954. the stem is laminated from four pieces.	5.3731018218958155
10955. take two three-inch-wide	pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make	the four.	4.277706524977897
10956. then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and	bend them into place on the jig.	5.5601134989822185
10957. the first two pieces butt against	the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace	between the first two frames.	4.206082279614016
10958. the second two pieces lap over the inner	member of the keelson and butt against the outer member.	5.287669828706269
10959. they're	glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson.	5.002654725520959
10960. a number of c	clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets.	6.161785936709903
10961. all bottom battens are two inches wide.	4.909850832916334
10962. the side ones are a half-inch	narrower.	6.023085707790876
10963. the battens are carefully fastened in place after some	necessary fairing on all frames.	3.269939766571228
10964. glue and 1-12-inch no 10 screws	are used.	6.108421767997137
10965. placement is important because the rear seat bunks and	front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens.	3.836217806605546
10966. with the exception of two battens all run to the stem where they	are glued and screwed after careful beveling.	5.894815580503765
10967. the chines go in the same	way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength	and easier bending.	3.6169906025125833
10968. fairing is always a tedious job but	the work can be cut down considerably with a skill planer and a simple	jig.	5.370596926742846
10969. i clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer	with a pair of sure grips.	3.8818883914941122
10970. the aluminum flush against the battens	acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson	to the proper bevels easily.	4.391188559025658
10971. if you don't own a planer and don't	want to buy one it's well worth renting.	3.879233689240298
10972. is five-ply 38-inch-thick weldwood royal marine plywood.	6.88452180953691
10973. this	can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long.	4.179971277817728
10974. the 42-inch width	leaves very little waste.	5.414682458273174
10975. plank the sides first	using glue and one-inch no 12 stronghold nails at all battens	the stem and the transom.	3.327953309363623
10976. another person inside with a weight against	each batten will help in the fastening.	5.863117545971266
10977. the best procedure is to	have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off.	3.423553521109436
10978. i used a homemaster routo-jig made by porter	cable for this job.	6.13792969826445
10979. it's good for cutting all the planking because	it cuts with a bit-like blade at high rpm and does not chatter	the plywood like a saber saw.	3.2618120469844394
10980. when cut the planking is clamped	in place for a final and careful trimming.	6.494279959517936
10981. then it is marked on the	inside where it comes in contact with the transom frames keelson and	all the battens.	4.182346830451912
10982. it may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings.	7.568369235546972
10983. the	next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at	the contact points.	4.4385850893801075
10984. then it is replaced and fastened.	8.808261032491222
10985. the bottom planking	is applied in the same manner.	4.311715861810444
10986. after planking the bottom	gets a layer of fiberglas.	6.8715319817595475
10987. the spray rails are first glued on the	outside and fastened from the inside with screws.	3.373252214959193
10988. then the chines are	rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation.	6.521215976574631
10989. since the	sides are also covered up to the spray rails they are also rough-sanded	in that area.	4.445105633830786
10990. the cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at	a time.	6.687069719242823
10991. a 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line	by about three inches.	3.6656051301164165
10992. lay the cloth in place and trim it to size.	6.283745314548821
10993. then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin.	4.367466202607071
10994. when the resin	has hardened mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish.	5.487589536847401
10995. i used bright red mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding	the hardener.	3.827909285958875
10996. using a cheap brush coat one side of the bottom with	the resin and then apply the cloth.	6.588743824544103
10997. when the cloth is smooth apply	another coat of resin spreading it with a paint roller.	4.226487448337802
10998. be sure it is	well saturated and then allow it to harden.	6.549502861040477
10999. when the whole bottom	has hardened use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth	at the keel line and near the spray rail.	3.529008977571963
11000. then lay a three-inch-wide	strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of	the stem.	5.936218550286472
11001. before the resin has hardened screw a one-inch mahogany keel	strip along the centerline.	3.9088039014378912
11002. this protects the bottom in beaching.	7.008080894576629
11003. fiberglas materials are available from glass plastic supply co	1605 w elizabeth ave linden n j.	3.3411224100595898

11005. is now turned	over and placed in a level well-braced	position.	5.145632628684753
11006. i set it on the gator trailer.	7.977745540369093
11007. i laid three layers	of glass cloth on the inside of the stem also installing a bow eye	at this time.	3.472021423642992
11008. for added strength i also fastened a small block on	each side of every frame and batten joint.	5.410261994998416
11009. again these blocks were	set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed.	4.102369853458106
11010. after trimming	off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them	to the jig at a working height the top of the side planking is installed.	5.713577231411769
11011. this is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom.	4.922665382010619
11012. these flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry.	6.736261464230577
11013. when they're	on the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten.	4.245189541112547
11014. the	sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from	frame six to the transom forming a real strong transom brace.	5.84433223147242
11015. note	another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between	these pieces.	3.916139137069337

11019. the exception is where the flooring butts.	3.9736301665207345
11020. these battens are glued	and screwed to the frames.	7.07787515798162
11021. with all deck battens in place the	bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line.	4.536315971759649
11022. use one coat of	firzite and one coat of marine paint.	6.803704698405989
11023. bottoms of the floorboards are	also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place.	3.525191772222721
11024. after	the decking is on the cabin sides are installed.	6.647785790890808
11025. they're followed	by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated.	3.9750890085621684
11026. the windshield glass	is shatterproof and plexiglas is used in the cabin.	5.91142994249489

11032. available	in f sheets it costs about a dollar a square foot.	5.90834863485914
11033. you can build this vacation cottage yourself.	5.396367151249533
11034. it is a full scale	small	but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete	in every detail.	5.443074900945679
11035. because of the unique design by the architect egils	hermanovski you can build most of it in your own home workshop	in your spare time.	4.224978463111261
11036. most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials	and requires the use of only simple tools.	7.02717431253069
11037. on the following	pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to	your vacation cottage from choosing the proper site to applying the	final trim.	3.8411100516973553
11038. in recognition of the growing trend for second homes	or vacation cottages we have designed this one specifically with	the family handyman in mind.	4.986015566730674
11039. it is a big project not to be taken lightly.	5.663019057146018
11040. but each step has been broken down into easy stages utilizing	standard materials and simple tools well within the capabilities of the	handyman.	5.212156016045563
11041. the idea behind our design is modular units	or panelization.	3.8287919052671704
11042. everything possible has been scaled to standard	sizes and measurements of materials.	5.917004277994447
11043. wall panels and structural timbers	are standard as are windows and doors making for a minimum of cutting.	3.632780991111472
11044. we have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so	that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop	panel by panel according to plan.	5.929405638500099
11045. thus when you have prepared your	foundation and laid the floor these can be trucked to the site and erected	with a small crew of friends in a weekend.	3.6742896560004525
11046. the roof timbers are	precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed	in a matter of three or four days.	5.9832279634833805
11047. then you can do the finishing	touches at your leisure.	5.102727203393595
11048. due to the fact that building	codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country the first	thing to do is to find out what if any they are.	6.555702325725716
11049. close to a large	city they might even specify the size of the nails used; in a remote	section there might be no restrictions at all.	3.732123309882121
11050. this can usually	be found out at the nearest town hall.	6.592045533207063
11051. at the same time check the electrical	plumbing and sanitary requirements as well as possible zoning	regulations.	4.656226263181744
11052. whether electricity and public water and sewers are available	or not check the local customs in the use of bottled or l-p	gas.	5.899973917739456
11053. be sure that this information	is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion.	4.302753832459845
11054. if there	are any major restrictions they usually can be obtained in printed	form.	6.629166396663817
11055. where a building permit is required find out what you must	present when applying for one.	4.1864132643154806
11056. in many cases you must file a complete	set of plans with the local building inspector.	6.178360000312093
11057. these will be available	at cost from our plans department.	4.47429641128312
11058. some general	things to look for in a site if you haven't already bought one are	accessibility water drainage and orientation.	5.703097330527947
11059. how are the roads	and how will they stand up?	4.523963209317992
11060.  is there evidence of wash-outs on the property;	swampy areas or intermittent springs?	6.266867010400903
11061.  a visit in the early	spring after a thaw will be very informative.	3.9898024440332316
11062. note where the sun rises	and sets and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms	come from.	5.439021444278341
11063. will the view be something you can live with?	5.010682619656021
11064.  don't	worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain; we will take up alternative	foundations later on.	5.345664565199054
11065. with this first issue	we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic	and the expandable.	4.208439175508481
11066. this will be for the	shell of the house only and does not include	the carport or balcony.	7.096900579017598
11067. this will permit you to get a rough	estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost.	4.512190159343801
11068. bear in mind	that this does not include interior panels for partitions fancy	flooring appliances and fixtures electrical wiring and plumbing	all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues.	5.088123189770371
11069. the	wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard f and f of	a good grade free from structural faults.	3.414489313397753
11070. they should be as straight	as possible as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when	the walls are erected.	5.802979404150615
11071. the outside surface of the solid units shall	be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood plastic coated	panel board high density particle board asbestos-cement board or	any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building	supply dealer.	2.89821525584828
11072. the inner panels do not have to be weatherproof and	the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired.	6.45836256397283
11073. all panel	board comes in standard f foot size.	4.581127304723211
11074. it is recommended that panels	be both glued as well as nailed to the frame.	6.361557746456769
11075. the fixed window panels	with louvers should have a good grade of 18-inch double-strength glass	set in a mastic glazing compound.	3.2222170772770653
11076. the louvers are constructed as	shown in the detail with a drop door for ventilation.	4.840700605440401
11077. there are standard	sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels	requiring them.	3.7337978565545544
11078. the door panels are designed to accommodate standard	doors which should be of exterior grade.	5.753840299362977
11079. the filler panels for the gable	ends are cut from full f sheets as shown leaving no wastage.	3.1559261054306655
11080. the	battens covering the joints are of f stock and are applied after	the walls are erected.	5.326402577079449
11081. all nails should be rustproof and aluminum is	highly recommended.	4.152472407919056
11082. note: if 12-inch panel board is used inside	and out or 58-inch one side and 38-inch the other and 18-inch glass	is used stock lumber in f f and f can be used in making the	glass panels.	4.8497920015907425
11083. other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special	size lumber for the glass trim.	3.770361849781092
11084. in any case there is no special milling	or rabbeting required for the panels.	7.1596182242676285
11085. with modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting	tools fixtures and attachments available the drill press has become	a basic home workshop tool.	3.4073933868917794
11086. the drill press consists of a vertical	shaft which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a	drill chuck a tubular housing in which the spindle is mounted	a head in which the quill is mounted a feed lever which moves the	quill up or down a power source and a movable table upon which the work	is placed.	4.842975684012557
11087. there is often a means of locking the quill and on larger	presses the table can be tilted.	4.329575270274009
11088. the size of the press is	usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity	or distance between the spindle center and the	column.	5.889065311213642
11089. a press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center	of a 22 inch board or circle.	3.36220669671213
11090. a new radial drill press with	a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done	at any angle.	5.01193029943645
11091. the head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on	the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work.	3.4142128069110673
11092. the drill press should be leveled and depending	on whether it is a bench or floor model bolted securely to a	sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws.	5.1062889047090705
11093. this will reduce vibration and increase accuracy.	4.846192505178084
11094. a coat	of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the	polished surface of the table; wiping with a slightly oiled cloth	will discourage rusting of the column and quill.	4.642834525774158
11095. presses not fitted	with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in	the lubrication holes in the quill.	3.7358994149300444
11096. the rest of the press should be kept	clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush.	5.61958728454761
11097. be careful to	keep the drive belt free of oil and grease.	4.376228309363814
11098. belt tension is adjusted	by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount.	5.270603055811012
11099. keep	the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when pulled by	hand; excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle	bearings.	3.183059165610205
11100. most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises	the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds	the quill in the raised position.	5.010816385297442
11101. the return spring tension may be	adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing	with a pair of pliers	loosening the lock nut or screw and rotating the housing	until the desired tension is achieved.	2.955661597337829
11102. turning the housing clockwise	will reduce tension counter-clockwise will increase it.	5.948951689113441
11103. lose the chuck key	some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide	a socket for the chuck key; otherwise you'll have to spend	a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the	press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the	bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not	in use.	3.3509913978668053
11104. drill speeds are important if you want	a good job.	6.700710916940436
11105. each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed	depending on the material worked.	3.9588390605472275
11106. on most drill presses it is impossible	to get the exact speed but you can come close by adjusting the	drive belt on the step-cone pulleys.	5.352329298365661
11107. you will find a chart giving the	various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere	in the instruction booklet that came with the tool.	3.553604066619104
11108. see the table	on page 34 for exact recommended speeds.	6.358118340326363
11109. generally the larger the	tool and the harder the material the slower the speed.	4.08787538349659
11110. feed pressure	is also of major importance.	7.44244539826987
11111. too much pressure will force the	tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed	or broken tools.	3.527681594824984
11112. too light a feed particularly with metal or other hard	material causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting	edge.	5.469359214186214
11113. the best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed	with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even	rate.	3.320211343478202
11114. there are numerous types and styles	of tools to drill holes.	6.216825749371702
11115. the most common are the twist drill the	solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades the double spur	bit and the power wood bit.	3.3042759669581767
11116. all will do a good job if sharp but the	twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others since they	do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual	boring starts.	4.911983287331282
11117. the adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting	large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by	reversing the cutter blade.	3.2554609055062413
11118. since fly cutters are one sided and not	balanced they should be used at the slowest speed available and fed	very slowly to avoid binding.	5.440063034438718
11119. fly cutters can fool you into putting	your hand too close to the tool so if you want to avoid nicked fingers	keep your hands well out of the way.	3.8458097595678
11120. when drilling all the way through a workpiece always place a	piece of scrap wood underneath.	6.299070706377062
11121. this will not only protect the work	table but also assure a clean breakthrough.	4.226553888901228
11122. another method of assuring	a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through	then drill half way with the dimensional bit turn the piece over	and finish from the other side.	5.215239323263794
11123. in soft woods with pronounced grain	there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander due to the varying	hardness of the wood.	3.5575218590834825
11124. in this case drilling a small pilot hole or	clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy.	6.042568468285552
11125. when a hole	is to be bored to a predetermined depth mark the depth on the side	of the stock then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark.	4.065110243706536
11126. the depth gauge rod can now be set and any number of holes bored to	exact and identical depth.	4.922163614430849
11127. the old-time bridges over the merrimac river in massachusetts	are of unusual interest in many respects.	3.268364677203706
11128. for their length their	types of construction their picturesque settings and their literary	associations they should be known and remembered.	5.545692608423835
11129. in this sequence	i shall write about them in the order of their erection.	5.14871520097483
11130. the	first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part- and perhaps	the most interesting one connected newbury with	salisbury point.	5.468135537496531
11131. its building was first proposed in 1791 when a	group of citizens mostly newburyport men petitioned the general court	no	1 newbury port may 30th 1791 a bridge over	merrimack river from the land of hon'ble jonathan greenleaf	esquire in newbery to deer island and from said island to salisbury	would be of very extensive utility by affording a safe conveyance	to carriages teams	and travellers at all seasons of the year	and at all times of tide.	2.91435781978022
11132. we the subscribers do agree	that as soon as a convenient number of persons have subscribed to	this or a similar writing we will present a petition to the hon'ble	general court of the commonwealth of massachusetts praying	for an act incorporating into a body politic the subscribers to such	writing with liberty to build such a bridge and a right to demand	a toll equal to that received at malden bridge and on like terms	and if such an act shall be obtained then we severally agree each	with the others that we will hold in the said bridge the several shares	set against our respective names the whole into two hundred shares	being divided and that we will pay such sums of money at such times	and in such manners as by the said proposed corporation shall	be directed and required.	4.495872527681229
11133. this paper was signed by forty-five	persons subscribing a total of two hundred shares.	4.039241637385289
11134. a month	later the general court served notice to the town of newbury that	the bridge was to be built.	5.766662108091199
11135. the matter was considered and reconsidered	and finally opposed but in spite of many objections the court	granted a charter on january 9 1792.	3.3245700797451336
11136. on november 26 of that year the	bridge was completed and opened.	7.187564309899807
11137. timothy palmer who invented	and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges	was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the essex	or deer island bridge although the actual work was carried	out under the direction of william coombs who received  300 as	recompense.	3.063990105268176
11138. this two-part bridge is best described by rev timothy	dwight president of yale college in his travels in new-england	and new-york published in new haven in 1821.	4.892876411936514
11139. he says	of it:   it consists of two divisions separated by an island	at a small distance from the southern shore.	3.670348767948899
11140. the division between	the island and this shore consists principally of an arch; whose	chord is one hundred and sixty feet and whose vortex is forty feet	above the high-water mark.	4.52785519790094
11141. in appearance and	construction it resembles the pascataqua bridge.	4.1045892243531545
11142. the whole length of	essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four.	5.188965165155482
11143. i have already mentioned that mr timothy palmer of newburyport	was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country.	3.812296648754182
11144. as mr	palmer was educated to house-building only and had never seen a	structure of this nature; he certainly deserves not a little credit	for the invention.	5.1078294171059015
11145. it is hardly necessary to remind students	of covered bridges that timothy palmer was born in 1751 in nearby	rowley; that he moved with his parents to west boxford when he was	sixteen years old; and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect	moody spofford.	3.270474003014015
11146. it was indeed a remarkable feat that a man	who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the	principle of the arch which appears in his famous bridges at portsmouth	haverhill and philadelphia.	5.023130476378267
11147. the essex merrimack bridge	when first built was not covered.	3.608280098848529
11148. as far as we know no american	bridge had been thus protected in 1792.	6.6484969180441045
11149. richard s allen is the	authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed	by 1810.	3.8050158471852225
11150. its original appearance is shown in an engraving published	in the massachusetts magazine in may 1793 which is reproduced	herewith.	5.662362590364904
11151. a brief description accompanying the picture	says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber.	3.612804474437807
11152. between	the abutments on the newbury shore and the south bank of deer island	there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet; between the north	shore of deer island and the salisbury side there was an arch of	113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long.	4.802077273929658
11153. a	dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place	july 4 1793 in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island.	3.5481777293700363
11154. it is said that the eccentric timothy dexter who was one of the	first share-holders stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the	occasion.	6.531506976137268
11155. the essex journal says that he delivered an oration	on the bridge which for elegance of style propriety of speech	or force of argument was truly ciceronian.	3.180150255453123
11156. the reporter must have	written this with tongue in cheek because dexter's oration could	hardly be understood; and although he later explained that he was	talking french it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to	the joys of the evening.	4.616699771932315
11157. the north portion of the essex bridge	was well worth the cost of construction although it proved to be twice	what was estimated in the beginning.	3.793454507097764
11158. it stood in its original form	until 1882.	7.2391518619033475
11159. the southern half however on account of its underbracing	was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation.	3.476738343097171
11160. in 1810 it	was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge.	5.804427428709014
11161. this was built	by john templeman from plans submitted by james finley of fayette	county pennsylvania.	3.5790834672410194
11162. timothy palmer had general supervision	of the work.	6.665235958404021
11163. an advertisement in the newburyport herald	december 21 1810 shows palmer in a new light as an expert on chain	bridges.	3.6684803309760126
11164. it reads:    information	is hereby given that mr timothy palmer of newburyport mass	has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the patentees of the	chain bridge in the states of massachusetts new hampshire vermont	rhode island and connecticut so far as relates to the sale	of patent rights and the construction of chain bridges.	4.8933560002050855
11165. mr	palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if	desired will view the proposed site and lay out and superintend the	work or recommend a suitable person to execute it.	3.078948683413852
11166. john	templeman	approved timothy palmer   this chain bridge proved	less durable than the wooden arch on the salisbury end.	5.171967999377747
11167. it fell	february 6 1827 carrying with it a horse and wagon two men and four	oxen.	4.117220268679569
11168. the horse and men were saved but the oxen drowned.	5.781323393427086
11169. in spite	of this catastrophe the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened	again on july 17 1827.	3.8722980251538845
11170. this second chain bridge was 570 feet long	had two thirty-foot towers and a draw and a double roadway.	5.036336882803749
11171. the essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868 when the county	commissioners laid out all the merrimack bridges as highways.	3.3127040045197202
11172. sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous	use the old covered wooden bridge that spans the tygartis valley river	at philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance	of the first land battle of the civil war at its home site may	28th to june 3rd.	5.181953546960866
11173. colonel frederick w lander impersonated	will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of talbott's	hill and thunder across the bridge to join colonel	benjamin f kelley's virginia infantry then swarming	through the streets in pursuit of the retreating confederates.	2.977226752437159
11174. he was closely followed by the ohio and indiana troops- thus the	old bridge has another distinction; that of being the first such structure	secured by force of arms in the war of the '60s.	5.586672083758172
11175. the	bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements war fire	and floods as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic for more than	a hundred years.	3.467575767701572
11176. twice during the civil war it was saved from destruction	by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister.	5.452462744008862
11177. it still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the	last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic	on us route 250- the old beverly and fairmont turnpike.	3.320379539613047
11178. it is one of the very few if not the only surviving bridge of	its type to serve a main artery of the us highway system thus	it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days.	6.462562404147666
11179. this	covered wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action	in the early morning of june 3 1861 and with subsequent troop movements	of both armies in the philippi area that it has become a part	and parcel of the war story.	3.5336795225237445
11180. so frequently has pictures of the bridge	appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the	old john brown fort at harpers ferry as the two nationally best known	structures in west virginia.	4.756040284781779
11181. completed and opened for traffic	in 1852 the bridge was designed and built by lemuel chenoweth	and his brother eli of beverly.	3.476666832644777
11182. the chenoweth brothers were experienced	bridge builders and against the competition of other and better	known bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of	the covered wooden bridges on the parkersburg and staunton turnpike	a dozen years before as well as many other bridges for several counties.	4.573379752117493
11183. the philippi bridge however was the chenoweth master piece	with its 139-foot dual lane span- and it stands today as a monument	to its builders.	2.998344930520428
11184. never rebuilt the bridge was strengtened in 1938	by two extra piers a concrete floor and a walk-way along the upper	side in order to care for modern traffic.	5.367743840582104
11185. during the war it	was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the	railhead at grafton to the troops operating in the interior.	3.450559951158788
11186. union	soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the	rain or other inclement weather and some of them left momentoes of their	stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams.	4.919813020056167
11187. but what the elements could not do was seriously threatened	when brigadier general william e jones reached philippi	while on the famous jones-imboden raid in may 1863.	3.4200856275230924
11188. general	jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings including the	long bridge at fairmont and after seeing a great drove of horses	and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge he sent his men	to work piling combustibles in and around it.	4.667120752603538
11189. reverend joshual corder	a baptist minister gathered a few citizens of southern sympathies	to call on jones and plead with him to spare the structure; he	reasoned and argued pointing out that jones or other confederate	commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat.	3.0236874474214783
11190. jones	relented he did not order his men to apply the torch- the drove of	livestock was driven up the valley via beverly and across the mountains	to feed and serve the confederate army while jones and his raiders	turned toward buckhannon to join forces with imboden.	4.865285356090865
11191. again reverend corder saved the bridge when union soldiers planned	to destroy it after filling its two lanes with hay and straw- but	for what reason is not recorded nor remembered certainly not because	of pressure from an opposing confederate force.	3.018884079476578
11192. on the second occasion	it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their	purpose.	6.59732797999367
11193. centering around this historic old structure a group	of public-spirited barbour county citizens have organized and planned	a week-long series of events beginning on may 28th and continuing	through june 3rd to observe most appropriately the centennial of	the first land engagement of the civil war at philippi.	3.0128767191778842
11194. it is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming	pool- eight enlightening vigorous rigorous not wholly unrewarding	years.	5.497770881183405
11195. we have learned a lot- a dash of hydrochemistry here a	bit about plumbing and pump-priming there.	3.728659176305175
11196. we have had sound grounding	in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy.	6.502190365145118
11197. we have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard	birds.	4.7370442934500785
11198. true our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of	our neighbors have built their own pools thereby diluting our spectacular	attractions.	5.3018593296913785
11199. but problems cling to pools as any pool owner knows.	4.025960811478483
11200. so our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials	errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the	first time- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience.	4.713036054987196
11201. position may not be everything but in the	case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties social andor	physical.	3.952426509057245
11202. we speak from varying viewpoints.	7.884808361158568
11203. one of us has a pool set	in a wooded area very near the house.	4.516445252130287
11204. the other has his pool far away	from the house in a field high on a hill.	5.719199952931659
11205. if you are dreaming	of a blue shimmering pool right outside your living room windows	close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of	children damp towels squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated	plastic toys.	3.2032409351900757
11206. you are likely to be nearer the truth.	9.165745755475555
11207. you can	also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living	quarters the greater the chance for violation of family privacy annoying	noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude.	3.7709826753766937
11208. on the	other hand out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children	cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the	pool.	5.94572607863937
11209. another dilemma: as picturesque as a sylvan pond in	the forest may be trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being	of a pool.	3.2063694800156806
11210. yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating	lawn every time the grass is mowed.	5.784305319351103
11211. as in choosing a wife it	is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be	in bad weather as well as in good.	4.180451172785072
11212. in the colder climes for instance	you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when	your pool will hardly look its best.	5.255936140707038
11213. it may be a big hole in the ground	filled with salt hay or an ice floe studded with logs.	4.022404184225289
11214. even a	neat plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold.	6.372911921791624
11215. however recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk-	flora and fauna generally- from accidentally wintering in the	probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts.	3.210819448081728
11216. naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and	size of your land.	6.714560419311905
11217. but if space and money are no problem and small children	are not on hand every day it is certainly more restful to have	your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs	of the house.	3.5576259600293
11218. and a good several feet around the pool should be neither	greensward nor woods but good hard pavement.	5.691488657387366
11219. the placement	of your pool however will not of itself solve the two major problems	of pool owning- those that involve your social life and those pertaining	to safety.	3.1120117691501474
11220. coping with them demands stern discipline- of yourself	as well as of your family neighbors friends and anyone you ever	talked to on a transoceanic jet.	4.8427466562479236
11221. eight years ago while we were	going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period we were	each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings	to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid	out nearby for the lord and master's delectation.	3.1614981225752836
11222. but not even our	first pool-side	gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies.	5.903176620584737
11223. we seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own	backyards.	4.5596981406240795
11224. our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled.	7.710521131975647
11225. had we taken a lien on a state park?	4.784943673533243
11226.  not at all.	10.982183186173845
11227. we had merely been	discovered by the pool sharks.	4.919335100881335
11228. we were in business!   from	proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step-	no more than the change from city clothes to trunks.	5.358418785693766
11229. nai^ve of us	maybe but the results of our impulsive invitations to come over	next summer and swim in our new pool were both unexpected and unsettling.	3.320762711091625
11230. after the first few weeks it was	obvious that rules had to be made laid down and obeyed- even if our	popularity ratings became subnormal as a result.	6.00647303373136
11231. so rules we made	in unabashed collusion.	4.861400120733399
11232. since our viewpoints in this respect coincided	precisely we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single	social code for pool owners.	5.36545238862148
11233. first and foremost: no one-	no not anyone- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations	to his or her own circle.	3.846078639124383
11234. just short of forty lashes we finally managed	to coerce our children to this view.	5.9786262696042805
11235. their friends and ours are	welcome to share the pool but on our terms and at our times.	3.9382834645357416
11236. no friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning	beforehand.	6.075179226520781
11237. no ringers either- even if they are trailing	legitimate invitees.	5.1076101696677565
11238. we want to know when the potlatches telephone	exactly how many they are planning to bring so that we won't	end up with a splashing mob that looks like coney island in august.	5.418302047406859
11239. no young children may come without adults except for a specific	organized chaperoned party.	4.027457980844845
11240. and accompanying adults are urged to	keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities.	5.435385955507013
11241. a gaggle	of gabbling mothers backs to the pool is no safeguard.	4.010074078092632
11242. no bottle	pool is tolerated- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come	to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk	and run.	5.008665803088702
11243. a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood	we designated one day a week as the time	when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours.	3.1572052248001277
11244. this has	saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less	brutal to the young less fortunate than ours.	5.291633676013666
11245. we also	worked out logistics for sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours	early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco	lunch en famille.	3.2340861873229296
11246. we gently usher them to an island of tables	and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where	they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides.	5.568183927269618
11247. all	dressing must be done in our small bath	house or at the swimmers' homes.	4.201719818573419
11248. a dripping parade through your house it is a good idea to have a telephone	extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between	we do however provide a limited	number of extra suits mainly for children and we stock extra towels	and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences.	5.398253583617323
11249. life-preservers the buckle-on	kapok-filled kind are held in readiness too for the very young.	3.8529462692512895
11250. safety rules of course are more	important than all the others put together.	5.88336725234502
11251. in many localities	now the law requires all pools to be fenced usually to a minimum	height of 5 feet.	3.5852543119854317
11252. but fenced or unfenced no pool-side is the place	for running or horseplay.	5.407248380225069
11253. we allow no underwater endurance contests	either or inexpert versions of water polo.	3.7696189503215924
11254. diving boards must	have non-skid surfaces	.	6.648831283888806
11255. and	divers must be enjoined to look before they leap either on top of	someone else or onto a pool edge.	3.3656154648786734
11256. our pools also have wide shallow	steps- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus	be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords.	5.256732474760904
11257. all bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool	and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups.	3.934087927589703
11258. when you first acquire a pool we earnestly recommend- for your	own mental health- a good long chat with your insurance agent.	5.365597433944554
11259. you	should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty	pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits.	3.7381526222567882
11260. soignee pools alas do not just happen.	6.3488708898660295
11261. they are the	result of a constant and careful contest with the elements.	4.167250546445834
11262. unless	you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your	leisure hours nursing your pool's pristine purity its care and	feeding- from ph content to filtering and vacuuming- is best left	to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service.	4.532492452194081
11263. of course if your	pool is close to the house your wife can always add it to her housekeeping	chores.	4.308949823130854
11264. or you can make pool care the price of swimming	for teen-agers.	7.517408433954946
11265. even so every pool owner in case of emergency	should have some idea of what makes things work.	4.341810496189654
11266. a brief course in	hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future	crisis.	5.6031098363996295
11267. a sudden high rise in temperature	will turn your pool poison green overnight.	3.5317487872899713
11268. the	walls feel slippery.	8.19324828528095
11269. with or without professional	help you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself	unless you have a full-time pool nurse.	5.101838798985893
11270. you should see to it	that the trap the dirt-catcher in front of the filter is always clean.	6.279375584276556
11271. a pool is no place for a shut trap.	5.065677015211366
11272. you should firmly insist	that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water.	5.643113249356749
11273. when shed	they leave rust marks.	5.240959590352051
11274. you can hope against hope that come spring	cleaning your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing	and furbishing.	5.350845475577729
11275. many hours of spring cleaning	will be saved however if you remove the main drain grate when you	close the pool season in the fall.	3.5068534608071515
11276. as the pool is emptied stand by	to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet.	5.854648762483313
11277. much of	the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp but requires dynamite	if allowed to dry.	3.5807075627047698
11278. if you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe you may	easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out.	5.417710164864315
11279. of course when	your 6-inch torrent of water is released it may cause a lot of comment	as it passes through or by neighboring properties.	3.8377317274862874
11280. do not forget	this possibility.	9.788962857163902
11281. if your pool is located on or near sloping	ground it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable	than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping	out the water and then scooping out all the debris.	3.6061616668143217
11282. it may be	true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene but lights also attract	all the insect life for miles around.	5.219998103706063
11283. once on the water these	little visitors seldom leave and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming	problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those	present.	3.8244790709141836
11284. often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light	you need at much less expense.	5.493359143089324
11285. our experience has taught	us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible from pipes to	brushes.	4.020947934303475
11286. follow pool-care instructions to the letter and be sure that one	person is regularly responsible for each aspect	of the job with no chance for claiming it wasn't my turn.	5.3574550449594724
11287. never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves-	even if the little boys do want to play space ship.	3.731162268734595
11288. you may find yourself	hitting bottom literally as you discover that water is running	out even while you are putting it in.	5.622762050702579
11289. draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower pennsylvania.	4.281151403482951
11290. any house built now below that line without air conditioning	will be obsolete in 10 years.	5.279122398382623
11291. fortunately it is the fha	which has arrived at this conclusion for it means that cooling equipment	of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage and thus acquired	with a minimum of financial stress.	3.779101428588655
11292. even if you live above that line	the fha will back you for they have decided that the inclusion	of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should	be encouraged.	5.612110367280771
11293. new simplified packaged units recently devised	prefabricated glass-fiber ducts and improved add-on techniques make	it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as	little as $600 to $900.	3.2155608138730294
11294. two men can often do the installation in a	day.	7.155049566894502
11295. you can install it yourself- this is a central system that will	cool every part of your house.	4.427627390839172
11296. its upkeep?	11.491538282516299
11297.  no less an authority	than the fha concurs that the savings air conditioning makes	possible more than offset its operating costs.	3.4563402561759355
11298. home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days	of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted.	5.9004485623064
11299. we know	now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually	desirable and accurate controls assure the comfort we want.	3.494113811630441
11300. we know too that health is never harmed by summer cooling.	6.429676686142676
11301. on the	contrary there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills.	4.2477030197529215
11302. the filtered	air benefits allergies asthma sinus hay fever.	4.811376377096995
11303. control of temperature	and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid.	3.871841653541733
11304. heart conditions	and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive	heat.	5.681395002707835
11305. the cleaner air means	less time spent pushing a vacuum fewer trips to the dry cleaners lighter	loads for the washing machine.	3.0827183079436584
11306. the need for reupholstering redecorating	repainting becomes more infrequent.	6.057741560165358
11307. clothes hold their shape	better and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words.	3.4442131907881106
11308. it	will improve your disposition.	7.792001475952827
11309. when you're less fatigued things	just naturally look brighter.	4.22303956260338
11310. the children can have their daytime naps	and hot meals and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms.	5.022989542896863
11311. you'll sleep longer and better too awake refreshed and free of	hot weather nerves.	3.4234096368183895
11312. you can forget about screens and leave the	storm windows up all year around.	5.8961366219045335
11313. best of all central air conditioning	is something you can afford.	4.453436187663039
11314. like its long-lived cousin	the refrigerator a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years	for any	house.	6.109396296962076
11315. colonial	or contemporary central air conditioning is easily installed.	4.0947337308516145
11316. the	equipment won't take up valuable space either.	6.140261495339498
11317. it can go in out-of-the-way	waste space.	5.74597096286026
11318. but there's no denying that the easiest	and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning	is when you build.	5.097912991785079
11319. if that's done the house can be designed	and oriented for best operation and this can mean savings both in the	size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself.	4.203613037044028
11320. if you	can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building	by all means make provision for its easy adding later.	5.043980752819944
11321. manufacturers	have designed equipment for just such circumstances and your	savings over starting from scratch will be substantial.	3.3738493305538393
11322. if your	house is to have a forced warm air system cooling can be a part of	it.	7.023507012052177
11323. this costs less than having a completely separate cooling system	for your regular heating ductwork filters and furnace blower do double	duty for cooling.	3.218941556666389
11324. you can get year-'round air conditioners in the	same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone- high or	low boy horizontal or counterflow.	5.346014402561336
11325. the units can be installed in basement	attic crawlspace or in a closet located in the living area.	3.614253130211708
11326. the	cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet.	6.439330784191655
11327. from the coil	small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set	in the yard garage carport or basement.	3.47514997911198
11328. if you plan to add	cooling later to your heating system there are things to watch for.	6.035507050078015
11329. be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed.	4.718269331786684
11330. they may be inaccessible later.	9.556142596799148
11331. be sure your ducts and blower are	big enough to handle cooling.	4.259309563571809
11332. this is especially important if you	live in a mild-winter zone.	6.567429880591049
11333. be sure you get a perimeter heating system	and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for	heating.	4.130600394353727
11334. you can get a hot water system that will also work	for cooling your house.	6.365056785205612
11335. for cooling chilled water is circulated instead	of hot water.	4.176070218803147
11336. instead of radiators you'll have cooling-heating	units each with its own thermostat.	6.6057352233316555
11337. these systems are more expensive	than year-'round forced air systems.	4.056821160413423
11338. the minimum cost for an average	one-story 7-room house with basement is likely to run $1500 above	the cost of the heating alone.	5.095172254138328
11339. if the problems	of combining cooling with your heating are knotty it may be cheaper	to plan on a completely separate cooling system.	3.726278237111627
11340. the simplest kind	of separate system uses a single self-contained unit.	5.174922218678538
11341. it is in effect	an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts	to distribute the cooled cleaned dehumidified air where it is wanted.	3.565795113281446
11342. in a long rambling ranch two such units can be installed	one serving the living area the other the sleeping zone.	5.843304761766953
11343. in a two-story	house one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first	floor another in the attic to cool the second.	3.616976296105785
11344. in each case having	separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of	permitting individual zone control.	5.530461289418801
11345. one of the	more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched	to heating.	4.978720424043842
11346. as you know a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping	the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors.	5.9881458366882345
11347. a relatively	simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine	literally runs backward and the heat is extracted from outdoor air	and turned indoors.	3.298647655864816
11348. up until recently this heat pump method	of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when	outside temperatures were above 40 degrees.	5.006753315081507
11349. now the machine has been	improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat	at temperatures down to 15 degrees.	4.132881514704258
11350. you can get this added heating	feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone.	6.658051563549222
11351. consider it as a standby setup at negligible cost for those	emergencies when the furnace quits a blizzard holds up fuel delivery	or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don't want to start	up your whole heating plant.	3.164548555422426
11352. how large	a cooling unit you need and the method of its installation depends	on a variety of factors.	6.104481502858236
11353. among other things besides the nature of	your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from	the outside it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup	of your family.	3.497229274630707
11354. families with children usually don't want the house	quite so cool.	5.8265221204060875
11355. if you are a party thrower you may need added capacity.	4.715465181759868
11356. the body is a heat machine and 20 to 25 guests can easily double	your cooling load.	5.256707182061285
11357. cooling requirements are best expressed in	terms of btu's.	4.053528415110078
11358. a btu is a unit of heat and the btu	rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can	pump out of your house in an hour.	5.452409434267855
11359. a very rough rule of thumb is	that under favorable conditions you'll need 15 btu's of cooling	for every square foot of your house.	3.263668995605028
11360. this is if outdoor temperatures	have a high average of 95 degrees.	6.336403955819371
11361. you'll need more if the high	average is above that less if it's below.	3.613995126968991
11362. coolers are also	rated by tons.	6.7286008274344455
11363. a ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by	melting a ton of ice.	3.729777042748441
11364. by accepted definition a 1-ton conditioner will	provide 12000 btu of cooling in one hour.	5.372128040871657
11365. you may find	a conditioner rated by horsepower.	4.916588973562215
11366. it is generally an inaccurate	method of rating for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor	and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll	get.	5.472666225447624
11367. a 1-hp conditioner for example may vary in effectiveness	from under 8000 btu to well over 10000 btu.	3.2087665213126955
11368. the	safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit	you need rather than trying to do this yourself.	6.2989480575594525
11369. don't urge	your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be	sure you have enough.	3.757513332607292
11370. better to have your equipment slightly undersized	than too big.	6.7390654767442335
11371. here's why:   reducing humidity is often	as important as cooling.	3.8348346533019018
11372. an oversize unit will cool off your house quickly	then shut down for a long period.	5.921131225955049
11373. before it cycles on again humidity	can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature	is still low.	3.9659976053377326
11374. with a unit of the right size a compressor will	run continuously during hot weather reducing humidity as evenly as it	does temperature.	5.623283451650278
11375. attention to details can	cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately.	3.697514140230051
11376. a well-designed 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled	and heated for as little as $128 a year or $11 a month.	5.144526224862453
11377. if you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate easily your unit	will have less heat to remove.	3.8149202755841496
11378. keep the direct sun from reaching the	house and you've won the first battle.	5.931646591296973
11379. in a new house generous roof	overhangs are a logical and effective solution.	4.396312484869052
11380. if the house you plan	to buy or build won't have big overhangs you can still do a fair	job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed	trellises fences and awnings.	4.780609119649101
11381. shade trees too are a big help	so keep them if you can.	3.8644846354488194
11382. drawn blinds and draperies do some good	but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house.	5.79157640588151
11383. the more directly the sun strikes walls and roof the greater	its heat impact.	3.460083901251832
11384. the way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence	how much cooling you're going to need.	5.0479477506680315
11385. a shift in the walls	or a change in the roof slope so the sun hits them more obliquely can	save you money.	3.5640355806589374
11386. you can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the	sun double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation.	5.7224467090719635
11387. restrict	large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house.	5.210044068730293
11388. they're easier to shade there.	6.976407867246039
11389. an attic space above insulation makes	a house easier to cool.	3.9675224965401497
11390. you'll even gain by putting your water	heater outside the conditioned space and using an electric range instead	of a gas one.	4.794787711824013
11391. gas adds to the moisture load.	5.028762456400708
11392. insulate weatherstrip	double-glaze to the maximum.	7.007579847470492
11393. in insulation the numbers to	remember are 6-4-2.	4.340765547137248
11394. they stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation	in the ceiling 4 inches in the side walls 2 inches in the floors.	5.263988490762802
11395. such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling	installation but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in	heating and cooling.	3.6261049049531398
11396. a light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50	per cent.	5.303594331957155
11397. it costs two to three times as much to remove a btu	in summer as it does to add one in winter so every solitary btu	is worth attention.	4.086009991877416
11398. you'll foil them in droves along with	their pal humidity by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan a	bathroom ventilator for when you shower and an outside vent for the	clothes drier.	4.414359899470288
11399. it's no use pretending	that all conditioners are quiet but the noise they produce can	be kept to a minimum.	3.335771259115002
11400. good workmanship is important in the installation	so if you're doing your own contracting don't award the job on	the basis of price alone.	5.071853570662992
11401. avoid attic placement directly above	a bedroom.	4.445077024248704
11402. most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning.	8.309890457044947
11403. this is particularly true in site selection.	5.404589776406592
11404. you must know before	you start what the needs and objectives of your organtion are; you	must have a list of requirements on where how many and what type sites	are needed.	5.274452526135847
11405. with such a program you can make constructive selections	of the best sites available.	4.689888398814332
11406. begin the examination of a site	with a good map and aerial photos if possible.	5.299841773486507
11407. these are becoming more	and more available through the work of counties and other government	agencies.	4.504758207913027
11408. the new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal	government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural	features of the site.	5.085919740265715
11409. these are inexpensive and available from the u	s geological society washington 25 d c.	4.079262942128054
11410. in recent	years many counties and the u s forest service have taken	aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning	use.	5.566575590641612
11411. most counties also have maps available from the county engineer	showing roads and other features and from the assessor's office	showing ownerships of land.	3.6428082528951027
11412. inspect the site in the field during	the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for	recreation.	7.013698477123137
11413. this gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the	climate conditions the exposure to the sun and wind the water interests	etcetera which vary greatly with the seasons.	3.8190067588615886
11414. it is usually helpful	to make a sketch map in the field showing the size and location	of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site.	5.9649059495144305
11415. these	are a great aid for planning use back at the office.	4.481140739647611
11416. for	site planning work it is best to have a qualified and experienced	park planner to carry through the study.	5.574850566816287
11417. however there is also much	to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are	available and interested in recreation.	4.308377269733385
11418. county judges commissioners	engineers assessors and others who have lived in the area for a	long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions	to offer from their varied professional experiences.	5.260430100271747
11419. a visit to the site	by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify	opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area.	3.613651074205972
11420. how much study is required?	9.097420012557029
11421.  this of course depends on	the character of the site itself the previous experience of the investigator	and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision.	4.011466059093037
11422. it is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick	judgment	of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone.	6.342373563356028
11423. usually	there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions.	3.742856346283573
11424. a site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance	today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little	development or water.	5.487688494215379
11425. the same is true of areas which at first look	good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually	be poor areas to develop for general public use.	3.6225719050469007
11426. in looking for	the best sites available that meet the requirements you need information	to compare the site with others.	5.317472893479492
11427. you need answers to four important	questions.	5.96435549892778
11428. what are the existing recreation features?	8.378090547385225
11429. 	how well can the site be developed?	4.245078585501796
11430.     how useful	will it be to the public?	8.108990311688393
11431.     is this site available?	6.919084683299732
11432. 	check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests	already existing at the site.	6.178621756293928
11433. naturally a park site with scenic	views a good lake trees and sand dunes will attract more people	than a nearby area with only trees and dunes.	3.3040544419454565
11434. frontage on a body of clear clean water will be vastly different	from the same amount of frontage on polluted water.	5.2275825245584615
11435. some recreation	features such as scenic values and water interest also have greater	overall value than other interests.	3.6789820054836024
11436. one of the most desirable	features for a park are beautiful views or scenery.	6.4479366889273395
11437. it may be distant	views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a	small lake colorful rock formations or unusual trees.	3.468752753444974
11438. a site which	overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating	traffic.	5.738417717295254
11439. an area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf	rolling in on a beach.	4.324335144933716
11440. a site may also be attractive just through	the beauty of its trees and shrubs.	5.919239817588406
11441. note extent of these interests and	how available they will be for the public to enjoy.	4.713503862099368
11442. water interest	is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation	site.	7.283857943723395
11443. most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas.	4.0499692575070485
11444. this follows naturally since frontage on an ocean stream or lake	provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation	activities of bathing fishing boating and other water sports.	4.838947107903655
11445. a body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract	the greatest picnic and camping use.	4.034000075325862
11446. it also cools the air in summer	and nourishes the trees and wild life.	6.086874029107295
11447. the amount of water	frontage the quantity and quality of the water and the recreation	afforded by it are important.	4.306987094142437
11448. a restricted frontage may be too crowded	an area for public use.	5.733997206991216
11449. the quantity of water flow may be critical;	a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant	or dry in late summer.	3.21884123572399
11450. if the site is on a reservoir the level	of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be	studied.	5.472277083589367
11451. check the quality of the water.	6.55678841273624
11452. a stream which has all of	its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation	practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one	passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area.	4.611466623373875
11453. other	factors such as water temperature depth of water the fish life it	supports wave action flooding etcetera will affect its recreation	value.	3.41599869369883
11454. other natural features which can be of high interest	are the forests canyons mountains deserts seacoast beaches sand	dunes waterfalls springs etcetera with which the area is blessed.	5.415153976763903
11455. just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which	are of national or state significance counties should seek out these	features which are distinctive of their area.	3.5017926058787396
11456. although the site may	not contain the features themselves there are often opportunities	to include them as additional interest to the site.	5.672518070435058
11457. the route to the	park may lead people past them or display views of them.	3.42636792765533
11458. a group of	native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can	be featured at the site.	5.577398230114591
11459. the fish animals and birds which	may be found at the site are another interest.	3.6403050731383253
11460. fishing interest calls	for a check of the species found quantity and size the season they	are available and the stocking program of the fish commission.	5.087899848356659
11461. animals	may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas.	4.2112368265633995
11462. the	site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its	own resident bird life.	6.005289424045509
11463. clams crabs and other marine life may add	interest at coastal areas.	3.5626371760028452
11464. each area has its own historical	interests with which much can be done.	6.191757373233729
11465. park visitors are always	eager to learn more about the area they are in.	3.9153609489713177
11466. the historical sign	tells its story but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the	original historical items or places themselves which still have the	character of the period covered.	4.864407498237629
11467. notice should be taken of unusual rock	formations deposits or shapes of the earth's crust in your region.	3.554513731536685
11468. those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area	can add geological interest to the recreation sites.	5.943389537228582
11469. an old shipwreck	a high dam an old covered bridge a place to find agates or other	semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold etcetera may be of interest.	3.584922336402231
11470. some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient indian	village sites or hunting areas caves artifacts etcetera.	5.0935163606595815
11471. how well can the site be developed?	5.037874742010233
11472.  look at the physical features	of the land to determine how desirable it is for use what can be done	to correct the faults and what it will cost to make the area meet your	needs in comparison to other sites.	5.546327760176478
11473. many things need to be checked:	- the size of the area alone can be a determining	factor.	5.361014897421453
11474. an area may be too small for the needs of the project.	7.588873432692527
11475. areas should be large enough to include the attractions have ample	space for the use of facilities needed and have room around the edges	to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments.	3.5652222269028466
11476. acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation	areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical	to operate one large area than several small ones.	5.401561042855932
11477. shape	of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the	development.	4.564943395953778
11478. a large picnic area or camping development is most efficient	in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width	in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide.	5.006199780497819
11479. this	is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your	buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions.	3.994277407651539
11480. however a	narrow strip may be very practical for small developments or to provide	additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail or include	scenic strips within the park unit.	4.94258732615486
11481. the values	of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands	ownership and use of the land and the utilities available there.	3.984425806947302
11482. for	instance a site adjoining other publicly owned lands such as a national	forest or a public road may be desirable whereas a site next	to an industrial plant might not.	4.805456001395397
11483. the utilities available nearby may	provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the	site.	3.587789918041113
11484. check the	elevation of the ground degree and direction of slopes drainage rock	outcrops topsoil types and quality as well as subsoil.	6.041076581092471
11485. nearly level	areas are required for parking areas beaches camp areas ballfields	etcetera.	4.083870155326892
11486. determine how much topography limits useful area or what	the costs of earth moving or grading might be.	5.115221726780045
11487. in addition	to its recreation interests water is needed for drinking sanitation	and irrigation.	4.070568565251256
11488. the quantity and quality of water sources is	often a big factor in site selection.	5.288955981663066
11489. the area may provide good springs	or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines.	3.3922889684116098
11490. figure	the cost of providing water to the use areas.	7.258239024182245
11491. the	existing plant growth calls for thorough checking.	4.1675032371497505
11492. look at the trees	as to size and interest the amount of shade they provide how healthy	they are the problems of maintenance fire hazards wind throw	etcetera.	5.775432305458088
11493. an area may have been partially logged and requires	removal of stumps or clean up.	4.147661435293754
11494. some shrubs may be of good landscaping	value other areas of brush may need to be cleared.	6.60884284416478
11495. the extent and location	of open areas is noted.	3.633504655909654
11496. how much will wind	rain sun and temperature affect the use?	6.636490951859644
11497.  an area sheltered from	strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use.	4.210272921693851
11498. the direction	velocity and season of these winds should be noted as to just how	they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation	of the area.	4.636574116981034
11499. lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for	the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable.	3.6247183255392166
11500. sometimes you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography	or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade morning sun or	whatever may be most desirable for the use intended.	5.748258191959254
11501. some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings	roads utilities cleared land etcetera which may raise the cost of	the site.	3.5156996421632023
11502. your invitation to write about serge prokofieff to honor his	70th anniversary for the april issue of sovietskaya muzyka is	accepted with pleasure because i admire the music of prokofieff;	and with sober purpose because the development of prokofieff personifies	in many ways the course of music in the union of soviet socialist	republics.	5.2080121205960035
11503. the serge prokofieff whom we knew in the	united states of america was gay witty mercurial full of pranks	and bonheur- and very capable as a professional musician.	3.2407490613082888
11504. these	qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic	haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-world	war 1 era.	5.346498722684491
11505. prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor	in america was indeed brilliant.	3.9682346544670066
11506. prokofieff's classical	symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted	and well-trained musician still in his twenties.	4.902890455612469
11507. to the traditionalists	it was a brilliant satire on modernism; to the neo-classicists	it was a challenge to the pre-war world.	3.7732789925047427
11508. what was it to prokofieff?	9.688449441965926
11509. 	a tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-century ideas; a trial	balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times; a brilliant piece	de resistance?	3.156174121620124
11510.  certainly its composer was an ascending star	on a new world horizon.	6.368266477132003
11511. i heard the classical symphony	for the first time when koussevitzky conducted it in paris in 1927.	4.330083102546601
11512. all musical paris was there.	7.895719206590346
11513. some musicians were enthusiastic some	skeptical.	5.17500969367352
11514. i myself was one of the skeptics.	8.854331533553474
11515. i remember	ernest bloch in the foyer shouting in his high-pitched voice:	h it may be a tour de force mais mon dieu can anyone take	this music seriously?	3.377801757162659
11516.    the answer is yes! certainly	america took prokofieff and his classical symphony seriously	and with a good deal of pleasure.	5.6354695468849085
11517. his life-long friend serge	koussevitzky gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances	in boston new york and washington d c to which	he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation.	3.3075765026836343
11518. chicago was	also a welcome host: there in 1921 prokofieff conducted the world	premiere of the love for three oranges and played the first	performance of his third piano concerto.	4.942329094911171
11519. uncle sam was indeed	a rich uncle to prokofieff in those opulent post-war victory	years of peace and prosperity bold speculations and extravaganzas enjoyment	and pleasure: the golden twenties.	3.1510607730015887
11520. we attended the	premieres of his concertos symphonies and suites; we studied taught	and performed his piano sonatas chamber music gavottes and marches;	we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities.	4.583681987737128
11521. we unanimously agreed that prokofieff had won his rights as	a world citizen to the first ranks of twentieth-century composers.	3.7175908737328487
11522. nevertheless prokofieff was much influenced by paris during	the twenties: the paris which was the artistic center of the western	world- the social paris to which russian aristocracy migrated-	the chic paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich	america- the avant-garde paris of diaghileff stravinsky koussevitzky	cocteau picasso- the laissez-faire paris of dadaism	and ultramodern art- the paris sympathique which took young	composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms.	4.329070700104896
11523. so young prokofieff was the darling of success: in his motherland;	in the spacious hunting grounds of uncle sam; in the exciting	salons of his lovely brilliant paris- mistress of gaiety-	excess and abandon- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone color	dance design and thought.	2.921572162542409
11524. meanwhile three great terrible	forces were coagulating and crystallizing.	6.2335520241978815
11525. in this world-wide conscription	of men minds and machines prokofieff was recalled to his	native land.	3.7233501469902857
11526. the world exploded when fascism challenged all concepts	of peace and liberty and the outraged freedom-loving peoples of the	capitalist and socialist worlds combined forces to stamp fascist	tyranny into cringing submission.	4.481722447914333
11527. after this holocaust a changing world	occupied the minds of men; a world beset with new boundaries new	treaties and governments new goals and methods and the age-old fears	of aggression	and subjugation- hunger and exposure.	3.2184819653791976
11528. in this	changed world prokofieff settled to find himself and to create	for	large national purpose.	5.674350155987765
11529. here this happy roving son of good fortune	proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic	order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world.	3.68633660348238
11530. here prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of socialism-	producing music for the masses.	5.734794681764294
11531. it is at this point in his life	that the mature prokofieff emerges.	4.734974686143604
11532. one might have expected that	such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative	flair of a composer especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous.	4.95533135744275
11533. he accepted the environment	of his destiny- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his	early promise.	3.4137983977822213
11534. by 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his	people: i have striven for clarity and melodious idiom but at	the same time i have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the	accepted methods of harmony and melody.	4.8129368090091385
11535. this is precisely what makes	lucid straightforward music so difficult to compose- the clarity must	be new not old.	3.7218349153316597
11536. how right he was; how clearly he saw the cultural	defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not	or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism.	5.379402568920872
11537. and	with what resource did prokofieff back up his credo of words- with	torrents of powerful music.	3.327234360399283
11538. compare the vast difference in scope and	beauty between his neat and witty little classical symphony and	his big muscular passionate and eloquent fifth symphony; or the	love for three oranges with the wonderful imaginative	colorful and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet	the stone flower.	4.345837468677601
11539. this masterpiece has gaiety too but it is	the gaiety of dancing people: earthy salty and humorous.	3.3102835638319195
11540. of	course these works are not comparable even though the same brain conceived	them.	6.453929606099607
11541. the early works were conceived for a sophisticated international	audience; the later works were conceived to affirm a way	of life for fellow citizens.	3.2705413849711467
11542. however in all of prokofieff's music	young or mature we find his profile- his signature- his	craftsman's attitude.	6.017756125496875
11543. prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the	cause of experimentation per se.	3.9173261247212428
11544. in orchestration he stretches	the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination	for color.	5.305588532153253
11545. his sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable.	4.241020176737957
11546. his creative development of melodic designs of slavic dance tunes and	love songs is captivating: witty clever adroit and subtle.	4.703702642864079
11547. his	counterpoint is pertinent skillful and rarely thick.	4.012163890500985
11548. also	it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic	modulations the brilliant orchestrations the adroitness for evading	the heaviness of figured bass the skill in florid counterpoint	were not lost in his mature output even in the spectacular historical	dramas of the stage and cinema where a large dramatic canvas of sound	was required.	4.522748661492142
11549. that prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes	seem professionally routine to our ears may or may not indicate that	he was less of an original than we prefer to believe.	3.4260651792665717
11550. need for	novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability.	6.404463056359236
11551. prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero who by the force of	his creative life helped preserve the main stream of tradition to which	the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually	added and integrated.	3.158887787288821
11552. at this date it seems probable that the	name of serge prokofieff will appear in the archives of history	as an effective traditionalist who was fully aware of the lure and danger	of experimentation and used it as it served his purpose; yet	was never caught up in it- never a slave to its academic dialectics.	4.800358740827255
11553. certainly it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared	him to the western world- not his experimentations.	4.29614307982724
11554. so	prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a	rich reward from them.	5.624468496997419
11555. nor can anyone be certain that prokofieff would	have done better or even as well under different circumstances.	4.05413123038694
11556. his fellow-countryman igor stravinsky certainly did not.	6.1678817213160535
11557. why did	prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity while stravinsky	dwindled in stature and fruitfulness?	3.9051942242591116
11558. 	i think the answer is to be found in prokofieff's own words:	the clarity must be new not old.	6.141998045184704
11559. when prokofieff forged his	new clarity of lucid straightforward music so difficult to compose	he shaped his talents to his purpose.	3.404182721201386
11560. when stravinsky	shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures many salons	many dialectics many personalities he tried to refashion himself	into a stylist of many styles determined by many disparate cultures.	4.7627471025978965
11561. prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own	people- by the compass of their national ideas.	3.9232583191157175
11562. but stravinsky	was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting.	6.032322685389527
11563. in	all his miscalculations stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder	of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations-	representing many peoples time periods and styles- into his own	music by warping the harmony melody or form to verify his own experiments.	2.9592826966779606
11564. because of the authentic homogeneity of his early nationalistic	materials and his flair for orchestrations- his brilliant petruchka	his savage sacre du printemps his incisive les noces-	the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical	direction for which his native talents were predisposed.	4.652467491953458
11565. but	time is running out and many of stravinsky's admirers begin to fear	that he will never find terra firma.	3.6457786795886618
11566. his various aesthetic postulates	remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself: supra-expressionism	neo-paganism neo-classicism neo-romanticism	neo-jazz neo-ecclesiasticism neo-popularism and most recently	post-serialism- all competing with each other within one composer!	what a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations! meager	and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty	protagonist;	a maladroit reharmonization of our national anthem	; a poor attempt to write an idiomatic	jazz concerto; a circus polka for elephants; his hopes that the tunes	from his old music might be used for popular american commercial	songs! stravinsky nearing the age of eighty is like a lost and frantic	bird flitting from one abandoned nest to another searching for	a home.	4.127868233486378
11567. how differently prokofieff's life unfolded.	5.412416034667604
11568. prokofieff	was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing	world without losing his particular force and direction.	4.936954277324127
11569. in the process	his native endowments were stretched strengthened and disciplined	to serve their human purpose.	3.4161545912627638
11570. with a large and circumspect	20th-century technique he wove the materials of national heroes and	events national folklore and children's fairy tales- slavic dances	and love songs- into a solid musical literature which served his	people well and is providing much enjoyment to the world at large.	4.798114751434314
11571. of course it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical	feat prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind	him; time and economic security; symphony orchestras opera and ballet	companies; choruses chamber music ensembles; soloists; recordings;	broadcastings; television; large and eager audiences.	3.2982608381259433
11572. it	must be conceded that his native land provided prokofieff with many	of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive: economic	security and cultural opportunities incisive idioms social fermentations	for a new national ideology- a sympathetic public and a large	body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose.	4.354979120086813
11573. thus	in prokofieff the union of soviet socialist republics produced	one of the great composers of the twentieth century.	4.054993212972768
11574. that his moods	even in his early years are those of his people does him honor	as his music honors those who inspired it.	6.007492873310647
11575. that he mastered every aspect	of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary	judgments is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous	pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture;	and perhaps of even greater significance- his music is strong 20th-century	evidence of the effectiveness of evolution based on a broad	traditionalism for the creative art of music.	3.464889858695219
11576. april 10 marked a memorable date in new york's musical history-	indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern united states.	5.671490371047875
11577. on that date the musicians emergency fund organized to furnish	employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the	depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes	in the stock market crash observed its 30th anniversary.	3.2152327004893926
11578. roy mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction	has a kinship with the english watercolorists of the early nineteenth	century especially the beautifully patterned art of john sell	cotman.	4.839001403568633
11579. and like this english master mason realizes his subjects	in large simplified masses which though they seem effortless are	in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough	distillation of the natural form that inspired them.	3.2700454630159284
11580. as a	boy roy mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the	out-of-doors its tang of weather its change of seasons its variable	moods.	4.875926087983063
11581. his father a professional engraver and an amateur landscape	painter took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions and imparted	to them his knowledge and love of nature.	3.26386999973838
11582. out of this background of	hunting and fishing it was only natural that roy first painted subjects	he knew best: hunters in the field fishermen in the stream ducks	and geese on the wing- almost always against a vast backdrop of	weather landscape.	5.070248350815092
11583. it is this subject matter that has brought mason	a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen but it is his exceptional	performance with this motif that commends him to artists and	discerning collectors.	3.663396272898459
11584. mason had to earn the privilege of devoting	himself exclusively to painting.	6.006462845581244
11585. like many others he had to work	hard long hours in a struggling family business which though it was	allied to art of a kind- the design and production of engraved seals-	bore no relation to the painting of pictures.	3.5287012480361666
11586. but it did teach	roy the basic techniques of commercial art and later for twelve years	he and his sister nina conducted an advertising art studio in philadelphia.	5.2361576941248815
11587. on the death of their father they returned to their home	in batavia new york.	4.738922432231116
11588. after more years of concentrated effort roy	and his brother max finally established a thriving family business	at the old stand.	5.168133912974866
11589. during all this time roy continued to paint	first only on weekends and then as the family business permitted	for longer periods.	3.9933786838958025
11590. gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether	and for the past thirty years he has worked independently as a painter	except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions.	5.265297010719746
11591. but even	on these the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off!	except for a rich friendship with the painter chauncey ryder	who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had- and	this was limited to a few lessons though the two artists often went on	painting trips together- roy developed his art by himself.	3.092258449728255
11592. in the	best tradition he first taught himself to see then to draw with accuracy	and assurance and then to paint.	5.374135656158965
11593. he worked in oil for years before	beginning his work in watercolor and his first public recognition	and early honors including his election to the academy were for	his essays in the heavier medium.	3.3554030560050374
11594. gradually watercolor claimed his greater	affection until today it has become his major if not exclusive	technique.	5.798622416620919
11595. it has been my privilege to paint with roy mason	on numerous occasions mostly in the vicinity of batavia.	3.819966555185419
11596. more often	than not i have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at	a respectable distance where i could watch this man transform raw nature	into a composed not imitative painting.	4.971357843340944
11597. what i have observed	time and time again is a process of integration integration that begins	as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form; color	patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition;	and that over-all amazing control of large washes which is the mason	stylemark.	3.3716317501337794
11598. finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the	job is done.	5.625927219607495
11599. inspiring- yes; instructive- maybe; duplicable-	no!   but for the technical fact we have the artist's	own testimony:   of late years i find that i like best to	work out-of-doors.	3.5592990106626794
11600. first i make preliminary watercolor sketches in	quarter scale in which i pay particular attention	to the design principles of three simple values- the lightest	light the middle tone and the darkest dark- by reducing the forms	of my subject to these large patterns.	4.692190965723014
11601. if a human figure or wild life	are to be part of the projected final picture i try to place them	in the initial sketch.	3.9963202343642896
11602. for me these will belong more completely to	their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage though	i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on	the full sheet when it serves my final purpose.	5.118915888017673
11603. i am thoroughly	convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects	nature will do his composing for him; as a result such pictures are	only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before	him.	3.62390820156406
11604. just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot	is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting	unless the position serves the design of the whole composition.	6.405631970963925
11605. if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain	units in his design often only slightly finer pictures would result.	3.3881207819950947
11606. out of long experience i have found that incidental figures and other	objects like trees logs and bushes can be traced from the original	sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they	occupy the right position which i call 'clicking'.	4.961145280354793
11607. speed	in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity	and crispness but unless the artist has lots of experience so that	he can control rapid execution he would do well to take these first sketches	and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition.	3.209886264625602
11608. if i have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition	i mean to project equal concern for color.	6.593771630735852
11609. often in working	out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere a particular	passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be	too bright too dull or too light or too dark when viewed indoors in	a mat.	3.3169517168284313
11610. when this occurs i make the change on the sketch or on the	final watercolor- if i have been working on a full sheet in the field.	6.094665584620069
11611. when working from one of my sketches i square it up and	project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal.	3.575724095516561
11612. when this linear draft is completed i dust it down to a faint	image.	6.633585476871335
11613. from this point i paint in as direct a manner as possible by	flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as i can manage.	3.7352154924481513
11614. however first	i thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and	design along the lines i have described.	5.401184612781937
11615. then i plan my attack:	the parts i will finish first the range of values the accenting of	minor details- all in all mechanics of producing the finished job	with a maximum of crispness.	3.489903292692135
11616. the longer i work the more i am sure	that for me at least a workmanlike method is important.	5.4458704352785405
11617. trial and	error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles	in the final painting.	3.6184846317107864
11618. as for materials i use the	best available.	7.642841618880798
11619. i work on a watercolor easel in the field and frequently	resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue	strain.	4.209942433614777
11620. in my studio i work at a tilt-top table but leave the paper	unfixed so that i can move it freely to control the washes.	5.703849168403248
11621. i have	used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers but prefer an english	make rough surface in 400-pound weight.	3.482756621527782
11622. after selecting a sheet	and inspecting it for flaws	i sponge it thoroughly on both sides with	clean cold water.	5.501664557314014
11623. then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that	it will lie flat as a board.	3.66112728245063
11624. in addition to the usual tools	i make constant use of cleansing tissue not only to wipe my brushes	but to mop up certain areas to soften edges and to open up lights	in dark washes.	4.921622415761599
11625. the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that	it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the	watercolorist.	3.5875916390777025
11626. i also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large	washes in the studio.	5.738606935414685
11627. my brushes are different from those used	by most watercolorists for i combine the sable and the bristle.	3.528619941816238
11628. the	red sables are 8; two riggers 6 and 10; and a very large	flat wash brush.	4.942699345168607
11629. the bristles are a fitch 2 and a one-half	inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge.	3.191549955729296
11630. my usual palette	consists of top-quality colors: alizarin crimson orange raw sienna	raw umber burnt sienna sepia cerulean blue cobalt blue french	ultramarine blue winsor green hooker's green 2 cadmium yellow	pale yellow ochre payne's gray charcoal gray davy's gray	and ivory black.	3.9413823527305247
11631. in analyzing the watercolors of roy mason	the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness	yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration	here.	3.298716630773311
11632. true a mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis	of nature rather than a detailed inventory.	5.830591525186311
11633. unlike many decorative patterns	that present a static flat convention this artist's pictures	are full of atmosphere and climate.	3.428639221983776
11634. long observation has taught	mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes:	a foreground in sharp focus- either a light area with dark accents	or a dark one with lights; a middle distance often containing the	major motif; and a background usually a silhouetted form foiled against	the sky.	4.428751758773167
11635. in following this general principle mason provides the	observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background	and the illusion of depth is instantly created.	3.131366977637308
11636. when painting	mason's physical eyes are half-closed while his mind's eye	is wide open and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression	he wishes to convey.	5.012506620570316
11637. he does not insist on telling all he knows about	any given subject; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw	on his memory his imagination his nostalgia.	3.3064235690558026
11638. it is for this	reason that roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition	of place for their enjoyment.	5.529759119960214
11639. his pictures generalize though	they are inspired by a particular locale; they universalize in terms	of weather skies earth and people.	3.4068533658912283
11640. by dealing with common landscape	in an uncommon way roy mason has found a particular niche in american	landscape art.	5.312163546084297
11641. living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience	of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor	a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor	the creator of it all.	3.3685677547791504
11642. the artist was born in gilbert mills	new york in 1886 and until two years ago when he and his wife moved	to california he lived in western new york in batavia.	6.009614003198847
11643. when	i looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be march	15th i realized that roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for	a watercolorist: the water sign of pisces.	3.473918225941741
11644. and how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes and	how appropriate that he should appear in american artist again	in his natal month of march!   over the years beginning in	1929 mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold	medals; two ranger fund purchase awards; the joseph pennell	memorial medal; two american watercolor society prizes; the blair	purchase prize for watercolor art institute of chicago;	and others in buffalo new york chautauqua new haven rochester	rockport and most recently the $300 prize for a watercolor at	the laguna beach art association   he was elected to the national	academy of design as an associate in the oil class in 1931	and elevated to academicianship in 1940.	4.209016737563969
11645. other memberships	include the american watercolor society philadelphia water	color club allied artists of america audubon artists baltimore	watercolor society.	3.4972058390506784
11646. the russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the american gymnasts	in the 1960 olympics for one reason- they were better.	5.438133635730335
11647. they were	better trained better looking better built better disciplined h	and something else- they were better dancers.	3.4603465077292697
11648. our athletes are	only just beginning to learn that they must study dance.	6.628987088930217
11649. the russians	are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics.	3.375956687212384
11650. but why gymnastics at all?	8.440162064486698
11651.  and is the sport really important?	5.8813479441096215
11652. 	after all we did pretty well in some other areas of the olympics	competition.	6.359726788106898
11653. but if it is important what can we do to improve ourselves?	6.127666652060198
11654. 	it is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem	for just as gymnastics can learn from dance dance has some very	important things to learn from gymnastics.	5.100861732205384
11655. taking first things	first let's understand the sport called gymnastics.	4.240742973014594
11656. it is made up	of tumbling which might be said to start with a somersault run through	such stunts as headstands handstands cartwheels backbends and	culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists	h and apparatus work.	4.704276153738031
11657. the apparatus used by gymnasts was once a	common sight in american gyms but about 1930 it was dropped in favor	of games.	3.0866260151988256
11658. the parallel bars horse buck springboard horizontal bar	rings and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball	volleyball basketball and football.	4.340161973174072
11659. but the russians use	gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because	it provides training in every basic quality except one endurance.	3.869026364605369
11660. the	gymnast must develop strength flexibility coordination timing	rhythm courage discipline persistence and the desire for perfection.	5.062455673079849
11661. in short gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great	deal of character as well.	4.580483384986569
11662. the addition of endurance training later	when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury	provides that final quality that makes the top athlete soldier	or citizen.	4.681606688862819
11663. another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that	it can be started very early in life.	3.7822935166720333
11664. could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days.	6.605753022931496
11665. in most sports as in most walks of life the angels are on the side	of those who begin young and the russian competitor of 16 has at	least thirteen years of training behind him.	3.6903940614137385
11666. the american is very lucky	if he has three.	6.286748124787428
11667. if a nation wished to get a head start in	physical fitness over all other nations it would start its kindergarten	students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus	eliminate a large number of the problems that plague american schools.	3.847503357407248
11668. first of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension	since action relieves both.	6.726720246524935
11669. oddly enough it is proven that there	would be less reading difficulty.	3.9011074812950906
11670. certainly there would be less anxiety	fewer accidents	and higher scholastic averages since alert children work better.	5.956159328723654
11671. russia knows this and that is why there were over 800000 competing	for places as candidates for the olympic gymnastic team.	4.1284332910008175
11672. eighty	thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself.	6.1627732683412555
11673. we	could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people.	3.7128494536862635
11674. and what has dancing to do with all this?	9.128092934154532
11675.  a great deal.	6.373269565134291
11676. russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous	training on apparatus.	5.2266431709006005
11677. well-stretched trained in posture and coordinated	movement and wedded to rhythm they presented the audiences	in	rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any olympic	contest.	3.702284281289064
11678. american audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons.	6.641774796303635
11679. they saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing	with incredible grace.	3.7965727281793944
11680. they were further stripped of old wive's	tales	by seeing the slender lovely russian girls performing feats requiring	tremendous strength h and with not one bulging muscle.	4.875396284185805
11681. president	kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation.	4.283993143508295
11682. if	we wait until children are in junior high or high school we will never	manage it.	5.549947436296556
11683. to be fit one has to start early with young children	and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher	of dance.	3.6529363900572105
11684. if the dance teachers of america make it their business	to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come	some day if our schools are really responsible we will be that much	ahead.	5.112959936773964
11685. school teachers all too unprepared for the job they must do	will need demonstrators.	4.004948269711991
11686. there should be youngsters who know how to do	a headstand and also how to help other children learn it.	6.357653347706866
11687. they should	know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for	the sports we will demand be taught.	3.4216250958544694
11688. dance teachers can respond	to president kennedy's request not only through their regular	dance work but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes	for strength and flexibility.	4.968567036908325
11689. very little in today's living	provides the strength we need h and nothing provides the flexibility.	3.8465953579953647
11690. they often fail however to develop	real abdominal back chest shoulder and arm strength.	5.314360191381214
11691. ask any group	of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results	considering the amount of physical training they have had will be	very disappointing.	3.568200043104922
11692. even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas.	8.139582942187403
11693. this isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of	the 11-year-old boys in america cannot chin themselves once and	that english school girls outdo them in almost every test	.	3.1739797383516946
11694. the only area in which american boys hold their own	is the baseball throw.	5.910115234494899
11695. for arm and shoulder	strength a chinning bar is recommended.	3.9782954875345955
11696. it should be installed over	a door that is in full view of everyone and a chair should be placed	under it a little to one side.	5.928548870401075
11697. those children who can chin themselves	should be told to do one chin up each time they pass under it.	3.6536043851596975
11698. those who are too weak should climb on the chair and starting at the	top of the chin let themselves slowly down.	5.660232836652723
11699. when they can take	ten seconds to accomplish the descent they will have the strength to	chin up.	4.5173324583213565
11700. parents should be informed about this system and encouraged	to do the same with the whole family at home.	6.252125483583826
11701. arm shoulder chest upper and lower back strength will be aided with	the horse kick.	3.458583707626979
11702. start on hands and feet.	9.033127480291002
11703. keeping the hands in	the starting position run in place to a quick rhythm.	4.058455848041582
11704. after this has	become easy use slower and slower rhythms kicking higher and higher.	5.828801616840923
11705. follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on	all fours kicking as high as possible.	4.421060603129428
11706. push-ups are	essential but few have the strength for them at first.	6.323364492868553
11707. start on the	knees in a large circle.	5.594515332795095
11708. fall slowly forward onto the hands and let	the body down to rest on the floor.	6.092626858023692
11709. push back up and repeat.	5.398787790709661
11710. do this	exercise six times each class period.	7.298209085116355
11711. as strength improves start in	a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward.	3.5730238131394327
11712. start by falling forward to a point close to the feet and as strength	improves fall farther and farther out.	6.304973187132825
11713. try to push back to the stand	position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes	from the hands.	3.9802136422962398
11714. the push-up itself can be taught by starting at the	top of the push-up with legs spread wide.	4.913555213704977
11715. let the body down slowly	taking at least five seconds for the letting down.	4.322538467542994
11716. five of these	done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up.	6.191869247462436
11717. handstands come after arms chest and shoulders	have developed at least a minimum of strength.	4.121284964756337
11718. of course those	who have developed more will find them easier.	6.930682775055403
11719. start with the class	standing in a circle with weight on the right foot and the left extended	a little way into the circle.	4.140343812854018
11720. at first each child should do a kick	up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work	alone and those who need help.	5.893150197338957
11721. drop both hands to the floor and at the	same time kick the right foot up in back.	4.151816966059441
11722. the left will follow at	once.	6.545569174026123
11723. the right will land first followed by the left.	4.149319176101824
11724. return to the	standing position.	8.164279681234856
11725. care should be taken to see that the hands are placed	on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot	is brought as close to the hands as possible.	4.236112640230709
11726. this will prevent flat	falls and toe injuries.	7.111896792383616
11727. bare feet are better for such work than any	form of slipper.	3.8389905857254503
11728. eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough	so that the teacher can catch the leading leg.	5.860272727633734
11729. the child should	then bring both legs together overhead point the toes and tighten the	seat muscles.	3.1795059547852595
11730. be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the	hands and that only one foot lands at a time.	6.038978465414852
11731. the backbend	is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics and	as with all acrobatics the sooner begun the better the results.	3.1518445697146182
11732. have	the class lie supine with knees apart and bent.	6.041408220874611
11733. place flat palms on	either side of the head a few inches away from the ears fingers pointing	toward the shoulders.	4.3276359529546085
11734. arch the back upwards to make a bridge.	7.304310446980061
11735. be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor	rather than toward the ceiling.	4.236199410528926
11736. as flexibility improves the feet will	move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher.	6.426706852711296
11737. later this can	be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover.	4.807869433181075
11738. to further increase back flexibility work on the back circle.	7.581189453140719
11739. have	the class lie prone.	5.448617698444054
11740. place the hands in front of the chest.	9.315122192156014
11741. keep	the legs straight and the toes pointed.	4.683309001588561
11742. straighten the arms slowly	this arches the back.	6.0844144053688325
11743. at the peak of the arch tip the head back and	bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head.	3.8253532558349925
11744. improvement can be	measured by the lessening distance between toes and head.	5.467672924701291
11745. the last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the	somersault or forward roll.	3.791664844878956
11746. this used to be part of every child's	bag of tricks but few children can do it today; some are actually	incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting	or standing upright.	4.896722624233154
11747. for most small children learning a forward	roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can.	4.001175338991071
11748. after it has	been seen have the child start on a mat on hands and knees	inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require	.	5.66637978239706
11749. he places the hands on either side of the head keeping	the chin down on the chest.	4.383662353764715
11750. he then pushes his seat into the air and	the teacher guides it over.	6.051084254309109
11751. one or two practice runs should be sufficient	for solo.	4.768266521148121
11752. if however the child is weak overweight or afraid	more help will be needed.	6.039793226666552
11753. when the child raises his seat into the air	the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis; then no matter	what happens the child's performance will be controlled.	3.4314670626862243
11754. by lifting	the seat upwards a little the weight is taken off the neck and	the back is kept rounded.	5.329259069707292
11755. these are beginnings but correctly	learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed	by a strong flexible body.	3.6261431589124107
11756. even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal the good tumbler	will be a better dancer a better athlete and a human being with	a greater margin of safety in any activity.	5.478472549781025
11757. it is very important	for parents to understand that early training is imperative.	4.213411735142529
11758. and dancing	school so helpful in artistic and psychological development also	contributes to this essential early training- and can contribute	even more.	4.873964982102133
11759. every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual	defense	budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion	of these expenditures go for military electronics.	3.901665975252852
11760. we have noted how	some electronic techniques developed for the defense effort have evenutally	been used in commerce and industry.	5.40502803132229
11761. the host of novel applications	of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because	of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality.	3.1091223754186563
11762. when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment	the prospect is staggering.	6.338537061383477
11763. the author has recently studied	the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that in this	area alone the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities.	3.332570308717932
11764. the benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be	greater by far than any previous medical discovery.	4.6654665196484375
11765. we use the term	bio-medicine because of the close interrelation between biology	and medical research.	4.560460329575588
11766. electronics has been applied to medicine	for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine	the electrocardiograph and the diathermy machine.	5.698617743059567
11767. recently many	doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage	of bruises	contusions and simple bursitis.	3.5810189798345826
11768. commonly used electronic	devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit	tv and audio systems for internal paging and instruction	along with radiation counters timers and similar devices.	4.4419293557581
11769. in this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application	of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this	is where tomorrow's commonplace equipment originates.	3.386059980833291
11770. from the wealth	of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques	perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which	appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely	new tools in medical research.	5.67561440647982
11771. many cells bacteria and other microorganisms are transparent to visible	light and must be stained for microscopic investigation.	3.639060282286688
11772. this stain	often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside.	5.308088020147237
11773. a completely new insight into living cells and their structure	will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light	with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-tv	system to view the results.	3.226041221082924
11774. fig 1 is a simplified block	diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the medical	electronics center of rockefeller institute.	5.538484082971844
11775. by combining the	talents of a medical man dr aterman a biophysicist mr	berkely	and an electronics expert dr zworykin this novel technique	has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding	life processes.	3.0534952985565855
11776. three different wavelengths of ultraviolet	radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the	three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources.	5.271612405400728
11777. these wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the	rotating mirror; the specimen is magnified by the microscope.	3.358056094492811
11778. instead	of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the tv camera	does the looking.	5.5746634549830985
11779. the microscope and orthicon are both selected	to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum which means that all	lenses must be quartz.	3.2600209719827506
11780. the video signal is amplified and then	switched in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which	are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of	a second only one wavelength corresponding to red green or blue is	seen.	4.171652518616693
11781. to another the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated	by a synchronous motor.	3.7704818129728763
11782. this assembly also supplies a 20-cps	this is the same system	as was used in the field-sequential color-tv system which preceded	the present simultaneous system.	5.259470700327897
11783. three separate amplifiers then	drive a 21-inch tricolor tube.	4.22863362144715
11784. the result is a color picture of the	specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet	wavelengths.	5.725075865744171
11785. many of the cells and microorganisms which	are transparent to visible light absorb or reflect the much shorter	wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum.	3.7217314536583666
11786. different parts of these cells	sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often	possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color.	5.630079712214926
11787. where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows	or nothing at all ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation	into a color tv picture reveal a wealth of detail.	3.378142179778867
11788. at the	present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is	primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it.	5.340508184719371
11789. electronically analyzed	the medical title of lobar ventilation	in man by drs c j martin and a c young covers	a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics	to the study of the respiratory process.	3.3061012529641753
11790. at the university	of washington medical school the electronics group has developed	the respiratory gas analyzer shown in fig 3.	5.746008509581941
11791. this unit	affectionately dubbed the monster can be wheeled to any convenient	location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's	breathing.	3.4956912767515047
11792. in the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder	indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper	and lower lobes of one lung the total volume of inhalation per breath	the flow of air from both lobes and the pressure of the two lobes	with respect to each other.	4.8254066559506175
11793. usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece	while walking a treadmill standing still or in some other medically	significant position.	3.728830873980295
11794. from the resulting data the doctor can determine	lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail.	5.569758787057589
11795. techniques	the original electrocardiograph primarily	indicates irregularities in the heartbeat but today's techniques allow	exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta dimensioning	of the heart and its chambers and a much more detailed study of	each heartbeat.	3.2582274938226625
11796. for many of these measurements the chest must be opened	but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed.	6.314546001646945
11797. a group of researchers at the university of washington have given	a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques.	4.225047823165709
11798. one simple	method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber	tube filled with mercury around the heart and record the change	in resistance as the tube is stretched.	5.562740942646394
11799. a balanced resistance bridge	and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed.	3.6226229283906344
11800. sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing	small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel	and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy.	5.84521349300396
11801. the travel	time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes	about 16	|msec to traverse 25 mm of tissue.	2.8895486728775452
11802. a sonar or radar-type	of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for	body-tissue evaluation.	4.881462525708442
11803. in addition to the heart and aorta successful	measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique.	4.134467857295008
11804. the doppler effect using ultrasonic signals can be employed to	measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel.	4.733329716945738
11805. a still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining	the effective power of the heart itself.	4.27108323395694
11806. it uses both an ultrasonic	dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor	inserted into the bloodstream.	6.028133507356662
11807. the latter measures the heat carried	away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood	flow.	3.665830727817856
11808. it is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer mounted	at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left	ventricle to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself.	5.738718490974237
11809. this pressure	measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning	measurement is made.	4.386371300950684
11810. a simplified version of the instrumentation	for this procedure is shown in fig 2.	6.582067536864325
11811. outputs of the two	systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge	followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder.	3.2019811401495124
11812. from this doctors can read heart rate change in diameter pressure	and effective heart power.	5.76404763097206
11813. several	years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule	which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal	pressure data to external receivers.	3.5548988312821375
11814. this original capsule contained	a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm in	diameter.	5.150246658853786
11815. battery life limited the use of this pill to about 8	to 30 hours maximum.	4.074361125971572
11816. a refinement of this technique has been described	by drs zworykin and farrar and mr berkely of the medical	electronics center of the rockefeller institute.	5.04341596854167
11817. in this	novel arrangement the pill is much smaller and contains only a resonant	circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing	transducer.	3.68595538952117
11818. as shown in fig 4 an external antenna is placed over	or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc	bursts.	5.475500747678005
11819. the energy received by the pill causes the resonant	circuit to ring on after the burst and this ringing takes	place at the resonant frequency of the pill.	3.1686631169358637
11820. these frequencies	are amplified and detected by the fm receiver after each burst	of transmitted energy and after the pill has been calibrated	precise internal pressure indications can be obtained.	4.777032260172171
11821. one of	the advantages of this method is that the pill can remain in the	patient for several days permitting observation under natural conditions.	3.977075408658643
11822. applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are	planned for future experiments.	5.763560815200224
11823. one	of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine	detection is in the exploration of the human body.	4.413953436112784
11824. our readers	are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent	out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects.	5.6534121925940894
11825. various	methods of pulsing scanning and displaying these sound waves are used	to detect submarines map ocean floors and even communicate under water.	3.1444255705336857
11826. in medicine the frequencies are much higher transducers and the	sonar beams themselves are much smaller and different scanning techniques	may be used but the principles involved are the same as in sonar.	5.163271165514348
11827. because the body contains so much liquid transmission of	ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels.	3.706947852047047
11828. bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic	signals.	5.479531074810612
11829. based on this phenomenon a number of investigators have used	this method to look through human organs.	3.970505685773367
11830. a good example of	the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers	presented by dr g baum who has explored the human eye.	4.969246182556908
11831. he	can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate	blindness due to glaucoma.	3.4286492565394697
11832. the method used to scan the eye ultrasonically	is illustrated in fig 6.	5.12253540309554
11833. the transducer is coupled to the	body through a water bath not shown.	3.4813515918266864
11834. for display dr baum uses	a portion of an f an airborne radar indicator and then photographs	the screen to obtain a permanent record.	5.064806225448796
11835. a typical sonogram	of a human eye together with a description of the anatomical	parts is shown in fig 5.	3.971164034789404
11836. the frequency used for these experiments	is 15 mc and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy	lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter.	4.532376710484129
11837. the transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan just like	a radar antenna while the entire transducer structure is moved over a	90-degree arc in front of the eye to look into all corners.	3.276051835601905
11838. the total	picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector	scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period.	4.623256038727154
11839. drs	howry	and holmes at the university of colorado medical school have applied	the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have	obtained extremely good results.	3.505573426663146
11840. by submerging the patient in a tub	and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on they have been	able to get cross-section views of the neck as shown in fig 7 as	well as many other hitherto impossible insights.	5.2890874217126935
11841. as mentioned before	bone reflects the sound energy and in fig 7 the portion of the	spine shows as the black area in the center.	3.7322674574756807
11842. arteries and veins are apparent	by their black blood-filled centers and the surrounding white	walls.	5.097053343680813
11843. a cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in	fig 8 with the various parts labeled.	3.5580563940627186
11844. oersted's boyhood represented a minimal chance of either	attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a	span of life.	4.840258147584723
11845. he was born in the small danish town of rudkoebing on	the island of langeland in the south-central part of denmark on august	14 1777.	3.6813052142621574
11846. his father soeren was the village apothecary whose slender	income made it difficult to feed his family let alone educate	them in a town without even a school.	5.124774737556087
11847. the two older boys hans and anders	his junior by a year therefore went daily to the home of a	warm	and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in german; his wife	taught the two boys to read and write danish.	3.179663492563273
11848. other brothers later joined	them for instruction with oldenburg the wigmaker and also arithmetic	was added to bible reading german and danish in the informal	curriculum.	4.959542435460062
11849. oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the	boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned such as	the pastor to supplement the simple teaching.	3.296463540277197
11850. from the town surveyor	hans learned drawing and mathematics and from a university student	some academic subjects.	6.091894555550861
11851. the mayor of the town taught them english	and french.	4.113731303374945
11852. whatever hans or anders learned separately they passed	on to each other; they read every book that they could borrow in the	village.	5.051207520174723
11853. at 12 hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in	the apothecary shop which helped stimulate his interest in medicine	and science.	3.569855238143688
11854. his earlier love for literature and history remained with	him for his entire life.	5.784682147278082
11855. in 1793 the brothers decided to enter	the university of copenhagen and the following	spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the	autumn session.	3.6551797087174718
11856. while hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine	physics and astronomy his brother studied law.	5.6667362968534825
11857. the brothers continued	to help each other during their studies sharing a joint purse	lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of	their aunt.	3.0487908747793013
11858. they supplemented their income by small government assistance	by tutoring and economizing wherever they could.	5.127098173462991
11859. so impressive	were those serious years of study at the university that hans later	wrote to be perfectly free the young man must revel in the great	kingdom of thought and imagination; there is a struggle there in which	if he falls it is easy for him to rise again there is freedom	of utterance there which draws after it no irreparable consequences on	society h.	3.386025060674755
11860. i lived in this onward-driving contest where each day	overcame a new difficulty gained a new truth or banished a previous	error.	4.974878276485287
11861. he openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing	about science.	3.716810533257547
11862. in this third year at the university hans in 1797	was awarded the first important token of recognition a gold medal for	his essay on limits of poetry and prose.	5.445747215914355
11863. he completed his training	in pharmacy also taking his degree with high honors in 1797	and in 1799 was awarded the degree of doctor of philosophy along with	a prize for an essay in medicine.	3.2561947862521765
11864. he proposed a fresh theory of alkalis	which later was accepted in chemical practices.	5.697513424194561
11865. activity	han's student days were at a time when europe	was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in america	and in france germany and italy were rising from divisive nationalisms	and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the	continent.	3.297237116338127
11866. the new century opened with oersted beginning	his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in copenhagen	and as lecturer at the university.	5.028230322411699
11867. he was stirred by the announcement	of volta's	discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied	the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis.	3.427328242085277
11868. the following	year he devoted to the customary wanderjahr traveling in	germany france and the netherlands meeting the philosophers schelling	fichte and tieck.	4.593811635011336
11869. he also met count rumford	who was then serving the elector	of bavaria and the physicist ritter; these were oersted's main	contacts in science.	3.2840445753987058
11870. from go^ttingen where he stayed	for 10 days he wrote the first question asked everywhere is	about galvanism.	5.7296392150159425
11871. as everybody is curious to see the battery of glass	tubes i have invented i have had quite a small one made here of	four glass	tubes and intend to carry it with me.	3.709248181043376
11872. oersted joined ritter at jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks continuing	their correspondence after he left.	5.4508225426024115
11873. with ritter he was exposed	to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's	fertile but disorganized mind.	3.5101672525802794
11874. oersted remodeled ritter's notes	into an essay in french which was submitted to the institut de france	for its annual prize of 3000 francs.	4.951029961098727
11875. the sound discoveries of	this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize	was never awarded to him.	3.1684756674495587
11876. in may 1803 ritter in another flight	of fancy wrote to oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy.	5.128777244548681
11877. he related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and	indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided	with the years of important electrical discoveries.	3.4083558619958714
11878. thus 1745 corresponded	to the invention of the leiden jar by kleist 1764	that of the electrophorus by wilcke 1782 produced the condenser of	volta and 1801 the voltaic pile.	4.478507247442733
11879. ritter proceeded you now emerge	into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 you will have	to reckon.	3.8162438457109884
11880. this we might well witness.	8.237727461821738
11881. ritter died in 1810 and	oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of	it.	4.037188332569781
11882. in 1803 oersted returned to copenhagen and applied for	the university's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably	considered more a philosopher than a physicist.	4.960851910749786
11883. however he continued	experimenting and lecturing publishing the results of his experiments	in german and danish periodicals.	4.063181613361894
11884. in 1806 his ambition was	realized and he became professor of physics at the copenhagen university	though not realizing full professorship until 1817.	4.9853701427733155
11885. during oersted's attendance at the university it was poorly	equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences.	4.224225657200835
11886. he was however fortunate in his contact with prof j g	l manthey teacher of chemistry who in addition to	his academic chair was	also proprietor of the lion pharmacy in	copenhagen where oersted assisted him.	4.792567611373955
11887. manthey maintained a valuable	collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at oersted's	disposal during and after his graduation.	3.426808768485294
11888. in 1800 manthey went	abroad and oersted was appointed manager of the lion pharmacy.	6.215142379196693
11889. in	february 1801 oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus	and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates	of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates	of zinc and lead.	3.1492776956507162
11890. in the following year 1803 oersted simultaneously	with davy discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic	battery more than did salts.	5.422517519058572
11891. eager as he was to pursue this promising	line he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy	and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university	that he could devote only sunday afternoons to galvanizing.	3.331594549684054
11892. he assumed his academic career with the same intensity and	thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood.	5.421521771227111
11893. the	university was the only one in denmark and the status of professor	represented the upper social level.	4.098670243107277
11894. his broad interest in literary political	and philosophical movements opened many doors to him.	5.340110400604559
11895. his friends	were numerous and their ties to him were strong.	4.02470379176787
11896. the years	1812 and 1813 saw him in germany and france again but on this	visit to berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his	first journey.	5.066728195851689
11897. in berlin he published his views of the chemical laws	of nature in german and this was issued in french translation	under the title recherches sur l'identite des forces chimiques	et electriques a work held in very high esteem by the new	generation	of research chemists.	3.215390236051385
11898. his interest in finding a relationship between	voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated.	5.746635349309722
11899. chapter	8 is entitled on magnetism and in it are included such	remarks as one has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces	with the electrical forces.	3.3886470285851953
11900. the great resemblance between electrical	and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their	laws necessarily would bring about this comparison.	4.69710760190442
11901. it is true that	nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication;	but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those	depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest	difference h.	3.4281529932314267
11902. the form of galvanic activity is halfway between	the magnetic form and the electrical form.	5.629575236996868
11903. there forces are more latent	than in electricity and less than in magnetism h.	4.26678370523171
11904. but in such	an important question we would be satisfied if the judgment were that	the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity	and magnetism were only a difficulty and not a thing which is	contrary to it h.	5.171599652926726
11905. one could also add to these analogies that steel	loses its magnetism by heat which proves that steel becomes a better	conductor through a rise in temperature just as electrical bodies do.	3.321928957974159
11906. it is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature as	proven by bruckmann and coulomb.	5.5996512875195865
11907. by that one feels that magnetic	forces are as general as electrical forces.	4.216349955026766
11908. an attempt should be made	to see if electricity in its most latent stage has any action on the	magnet as such.	5.286143252756169
11909. his plan and intent were clearly charted.	4.419704397868044
11910. oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and	political discussions.	5.994552206784729
11911. in one debate he supported the freedom of judgment	as opposed to dogma in another he held that the practice of science	was in fact an act of religious worship.	3.857805322291357
11912. he continued as a popular	lecturer.	7.565951259818829
11913. he devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was	caused to glow by an electric current.	3.652953293621321
11914. in 1819 under royal command	he undertook a very successful geological expedition to bornholm	one of the danish islands being one of three scientists in the expedition.	4.909305556004376
11915. it was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition	lauritz esmarch that oersted succeeded in producing light	by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric	current was made to flow.	3.7124447445484177
11916. together they also developed a new	form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of	copper thereby producing stronger currents.	5.378730134373613
11917. esmarch was among those	who witnessed oersted's first demonstration of his discovery.	3.6762452650300514
11918. of electromagnetism	the association between electric	forces and magnetic forces had been	recognized by investigators for many decades.	5.368265244908567
11919. electrical literature	contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and	had altered the polarity of compass needles.	3.2612021703966803
11920. in the late 1700's	beccaria and van marum among others had magnetized iron by sending	an electrostatic charge through it.	5.075802242774283
11921. beccaria had almost stumbled on	a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge	from a leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece	of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic.	3.1420699646416033
11922. the resulting magnetic	effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise.	5.145857557772975
11923. the experiments of romagnosi and others have already been noted but	no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these	two primary forces.	3.1195108911126543
11924. oersted's own earlier experiments were unimpressive	possibly because he had like other experimenters laid the conducting	wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it.	4.784178682328295
11925. the sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains	ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the	university related that the first direct event that led to the publication	of oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made	before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820.	3.5594682182511272
11926. at	this lecture oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel	to a magnetic needle.	5.2913107211999755

12027. there are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle:	fence-line bunks- cattle eat from one side while feed	is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons;	mechanized bunks- they sit within the feed lot are filled	by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface; special bunks-	as discussed here they permit cattle to eat from all sides.	3.1903671239319045
12028. feed is	put in with an elevator.	7.49835997498227
12029. several materials or combinations of	materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk.	4.247858814486955
12030. the selection	of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation	cost of materials available locally and your own preference.	4.653155400950418
12031. no	one material is best for all situations.	4.790801233005874
12032. selecting bunks by economic	comparison is usually an individual problem.	5.821632997961571
12033. animals eat only from one side so the fence-line bunk must be twice	as long as the mechanical bunk.	3.888906895531452
12034. these bunks also serve as a fence	so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence.	6.546570116638424
12035. because	of their location on the edge of the feed lot fence-line bunks are	not in the way of mechanical manure removal.	4.083791999182095
12036. filling these bunks by	the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the	wagons over more time and operations.	4.832603847137181
12037. all-weather roads must	be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all	year.	3.7405619600023234
12038. this will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall.	8.824450925174528
12039. marketing in the new decade will be no picnic- for the sixties	will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you	have experienced in the last 20-25 yr.	3.6714285263214914
12040. why?	11.55875815210223
12041.  companies of	all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies-	in modern equipment and new processes enlarged r+d	facilities faster new product development.	3.1748832374920557
12042. many companies have upgraded	their sales manpower and tested new selling distribution and promotion	techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge.	5.168572122313128
12043. given this	kind of business climate what competitive marketing problems will your	company face in the next 10 yr?	3.819562983195734
12044.  based on our experience with	clients we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups-	the market place itself marketing methods and marketing management.	4.916939848401158
12045. there has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent	years; there is every indication it will continue.	4.355059007357943
12046. frequently wittingly	or unwittingly price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers	distributors and dealers.	5.441090277178204
12047. despite generally good levels of	income we see greater price pressures than ever before- traveling	back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer.	3.2758437021076543
12048. here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy	will be on target:   has the probable price situation in	your field been forecast as a basis for future planning?	5.04155036460842
12049.  have cost	studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might	be done if things get worse?	3.925559129762693
12050.  have you actually checked out	different selling approaches designed to counter	the price competition problem?	5.588988744817351
12051. 	average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding	product and advertising claims partly because of widespread criticism	of such assertions.	3.4660317863466967
12052. this problem can force a change in marketing approach	in many kinds of businesses.	5.950105165172139
12053. have you examined this problem of	increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company?	4.05751874161749
12054. 	need for service is here	to stay- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the	sixties.	5.868084637126928
12055. there are two reasons for this.	5.691861405400822
12056. first most products tend to	become more complex.	7.107927185845823
12057. second in a competitive market the customer	feels his weight and throws it around.	3.805145521635314
12058. providing good customer	service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning	job as the original selling of the product.	4.968245333071208
12059. too often it is	thought of at the last moment of new product introduction.	4.606687854142535
12060. good	service starts with product design and planning: many products seem	to be designed for a production economy not for a service one.	5.0831751427325
12061. proper	follow-through requires training your own sales organization and	your distributor organizations not only in the techniques but also	in good customer relations.	3.5838812734239034
12062. have you assessed the importance of	wider discretionary	choices for customers.	6.474069125537941
12063. the consumer is	pulled in many directions.	3.8428170404699715
12064. to the manufacturer of the more convenient-type	product- the purchase of which can be switched delayed or	put off entirely- the implications are important.	5.864507312134762
12065. your competition	is now proportionately greater- you are competing not only against manufacturers	in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers	of other appealing consumer products.	3.2716333652811516
12066. many industry trade	associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share	of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products.	4.91303248563052
12067. has your company thought through its strategy in this whole discretionary	buying area?	4.033785015367378
12068. 	the trends have been in evidence for many years- population shifts	to the southwest and far west and from city to suburbs.	5.3665561432038436
12069. these shifts	will continue in the next 10 yr.	5.153628539201797
12070. have you considered the implications	of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation	strength of distributor organizations and even plant location?	5.581019802512826
12071. 	we	have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions	in the food industry- at both the manufacturing and retail ends.	3.243321159647584
12072. instead of relatively small sales to many accounts there are now larger	sales to or through fewer accounts.	5.719846422265064
12073. the change may require	different products pricing packaging warehousing salesmanship advertising	and executive attention- practically every link in the marketing	network may have to be adjusted.	3.2606371505885248
12074. have you examined these trends	forecast the effects and planned your marketing strategy to compete	effectively under changing circumstances?	5.2962763426463795
12075. 	methods	in the area	of private label competition it is logical to expect a continuation of	trends which have been under way during the first decade.	3.641691173013635
12076. as mass dealer	and distributor organizations grow in size there is every reason	to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the	distributor's profits- which is in effect what the sale of private	brands tends to do.	5.818715410683286
12077. average manufacturer frequently has	helped build private brand business delivering largely the same qualities	and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded.	3.271212211598151
12078. moreover	the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain	stores have insisted on high quality- and the customer seems to have	caught on.	4.901771870372547

12088.  are you experimenting with different selling	higher costs of distribution	some distribution costs are kept up by competitive	pressure some by the fact that the customers have come to expect	certain niceties and flourishes.	5.600192650498874
12089. no manufacturer has taken the initiative	in pointing out the costs involved.	4.526618921523499

12099. distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties-	and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study	each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job.	3.6407893504405258
12100. from the manufacturer's	point of view the increasing cost of advertising and promotion	is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties.	5.9843096006676
12101. it is accentuated	by the need for pre-selling goods and private label competition.	4.275150074488049

12112.  technical knowledge is a wonderful thing	but it's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register.	5.028103013995511
12113. are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd	a new product through to commercialization; who can develop reliable	estimates of sales volume production and distribution costs; and	translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which	management can act on with some assurance?	3.162966328762818
12114.  we have seen good new	products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts	and plans- and management couldn't make up its mind.	5.175234781442177
12115. in marketing management	there is a shortage of salesmen today.	4.282036248934084
12116. in the future quantitative	demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy and	the qualitative need will be greater still.	6.51992776456445
12117. while many companies	have done fine work in developing sales personnel much of it has been	product rather than sales training.	3.7229892201441164
12118. nor has the training been enough	in relation to the need.	7.232685351354193

12122. men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager	are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications	called for by this type of management work.	5.344818991953391
12123. the growth of business	has outdistanced the available supply and the demand will continue to	exceed the supply in the sixties.	3.3269237783906287
12124. does your company have a program	for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel	for the longer term?	5.8308835998097095
12125.  does your management climate and your management	compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people?	3.7968498542971614
12126. 	every single	problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning.	5.340115943317509
12127. hip-pocket	tactics are going to be harder to apply.	5.091056807652154
12128. many food and	beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis.	6.198913036279341
12129. with greater investments in plant facilities with automation	growing you can't switch around either in volume or in product	design as much as was formerly possible- or at least not as economically.	3.605175621558903
12130. are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently	in your company?	6.722734459527818

12132. are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management	group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the	marketing team?	5.688760327044672
12133.  do you have a long-term marketing	program?	6.895620587572941
12134.    the key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining	your company's marketing problems realistically.	5.198257249643875
12135. solutions	frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems	whether they be in the market in marketing methods or in marketing	management.	3.843518320775823
12136. if companies will take the time to give objective	consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke	then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective	marketing in next decade.	5.2886064186848
12137. the controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior	designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought	clearly into focus one important difference of opinion.	3.3238334655826645
12138. the architects	do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently	good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect	and that therefore the interior designer is incapable of understanding	the architectural principles involved in planning the interior	of a building.	5.135852513634584
12139. ordinary politeness may have militated against	this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance	in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables workshops	or panel discussions- whatever they are called- on this subject	will recognize that the final boiled down crux of the matter is	education.	3.0917037316669513
12140. it is true that most architectural schools have five	year courses some even have six or more.	5.728698784528648
12141. the element of public danger	which enters so largely into architectural certification however	would demand a prolonged study of structure.	3.019553691331735
12142. this would naturally	lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior	designer's training.	5.833211747278749
12143. we may then dismiss the time difference	between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior	design student as not having serious bearing on the subject.	3.6593423561827345
12144. the	real question that follows is- how are those four years used and what	is their value as training?	5.20284775201728
12145.    the american institute of interior	designers has published a recommended course for designers and	a percentage layout of such a course.	3.5481199911131798
12146. an examination of some forty	catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design for the most	part schools accredited by membership in the national association of	schools of art and a further on the spot inspection of a number	of schools show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations.	4.949722651147625
12147. one or two of the schools have a five year curriculum but	the usual pattern of american education has limited most of them to	the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions.	4.2451457001892665
12148. the suggested course of the aid was based	on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to	curricular necessities.	5.335918066449489
12149. obviously the four year provision limits this	to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated.	3.8621866247060366
12150. without comparing the relative merits of the two courses- architecture	versus interior design- let us examine the educational needs	of the interior designer.	5.448971140000239
12151. to begin with what is an interior	designer?	5.849639975053636
12152.  the dictionary of occupational titles published	by the u s department of labor describes him as follows: designs	plans and furnishes interiors of houses commercial and institutional	structures hotels clubs ships theaters as well as set	decorations for motion picture arts and television.	4.741243794255517
12153. makes drawings and	plans of rooms showing placement of furniture floor coverings wall	decorations and determines color schemes.	3.3381770841525586
12154. furnishes complete	cost estimates for clients approval.	6.269764888401955
12155. makes necessary purchases places	contracts supervises construction installation finishing and placement	of furniture fixtures and other correlated furnishings and follows	through to completion of project.	3.1079234848657893
12156. in addition to this	the u s civil service bureau when examining applicants for	government positions as interior designers expects that when various	needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them.	5.018049654788153
12157. he must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture	of any craft materials needed in the furnishings.	3.6283887126797945
12158. this	seems like a large order.	7.369243405779606
12159. the interior designer then must first be	an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and	plumbing and finance.	3.186315023610791
12160. yet nobody will question the necessity of all this	and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice	it.	5.7164492481454605
12161. and further he must understand his obligation to the client	to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve	his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society.	3.30390389351409
12162. few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording	of their curriculum.	6.532933223780515
12163. it is in the quality of the teaching of all this	that a question may arise.	5.1648510121844655
12164. the old established independent art	schools try their best to fulfill their obligations.	5.344909662038924
12165. yet even here	many a problem is presented; as in a recent design competition with	a floor plan and the simple command- design a luxury apartment;	no description of the client or his cultural level no assertion of	geographical area or local social necessities- simply a luxury	apartment.	3.2609906590925126
12166. working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only	in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may	please the public relations department but have little to do with the	essence of interior design.	5.0204521295973255
12167. it is possible of course to work	on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will	explain their necessities so that the student may get the feel	of real interior design demands.	3.570222846850177
12168. unfortunately the purely synthetic	problem is the rule.	7.340081455847323
12169. it is like medical schools in india where	in that fairy-land of religious inhibition the dissection of dead	bodies is frowned upon.	3.349794108464393
12170. instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs	of plants.	6.878408622171598
12171. thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense	of actual experience.	4.459538398848903
12172. in the earlier years of training certain	phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its	use.	5.929855181370538
12173. but to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable.	4.758286269316859
12174. consultation with architects clients real estate men	fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development	of class problems just as in actual work.	5.173962967005115
12175. fortunately although	only a few years ago they held the student at arms length today	the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student not only	from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from	the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of	tomorrow- that the student already is in the trade.	3.8521161100999555
12176. even	the history of furniture can hardly be taught exclusively from	photographs and lantern slides.	5.663258045562678
12177. here too the reality of actual furniture	must be experienced.	4.964327894483688
12178. the professional organizations such	as american institute of interior designers national society	of interior designers home fashions league and various trade associations	can and do aid greatly in this work.	4.552005621735489
12179. certainly every educator	involved in interior design should be a member and active in thework	of one of these organizations.	4.562147142364412
12180. not only should every educator	above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of	the professional organizations but his first qualification for membership	as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership	would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject.	5.477394508422215
12181. participation for the educator in this case however would have to	be raised to full and complete membership.	3.843053853585581
12182. the largest of these organizations	at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the	conduct and standards of the group and indeed refuses him even the	right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog.	4.817044352723176
12183. this anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower	his standing in the eyes of the students.	3.8924209282073554
12184. the professor in turn	dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in	the policies and standards of which he has no voice.	5.5194974691180025
12185. this seems	somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications	for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced the	educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands.	3.304514332634287
12186. in one way the institutes and societies do a disservice to	the schools.	6.416881160516185
12187. that is in the continuance of the grandfather clauses	in their membership requirements.	5.049551448883952
12188. when these groups were	first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have	had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were	rare and	undeveloped during their youth.	4.902522629215961
12189. long hard years of on the	job training had brought them to their competence.	4.138257535491824
12190. the necessity	of that day has long disappeared.	5.693710871448318
12191. there is plenty of opportunity	for proper education today.	4.827820076125034
12192. it is discouraging for students to realize	that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they	are supposed to stand.	5.174883760250124
12193. the reason and the day of grandfather	clauses has long since passed.	4.4598504301211594
12194. no one can deny that these back	door admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused	nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents	to membership in supposedly learned societies.	5.468518751768842
12195. beyond	any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality	of the teachers themselves.	3.577213276175712
12196. it will occur to anyone that the teacher	must have adequate education a depth and breadth of knowledge far	beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication	to his subject and to his students.	4.997121547522541
12197. the local decorator who rushes	in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these	qualifications.	4.00455019175124
12198. nor will the hack the jack-of-all-trades still	found in some of the smaller art schools suffice.	6.318864781875402
12199. only a	few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher	of interior design.	4.06137875265583
12200. at the end of its letter was the information	that applicants for this position must also be prepared to teach costume	design and advertising art.	6.04243201564242
12201. this kind of irresponsibility toward	their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude	in the future designer.	3.5990794339270837
12202. we must build a corp of highly professional	teachers of interior design who have had education experience	in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments	of teaching- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres.	5.2096590246707555
12203. considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture	furniture design textiles and color is also desirable.	3.4729248444849325
12204. in all degree courses in interior design a number of academic	or general studies courses are included.	6.420770774523221
12205. it is only fair	to demand that teachers of courses in english history psychology	and so on be as well informed in matters of art especially interior	design as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects.	3.4624255631452723
12206. the	proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only	if this standard is observed.	5.558263618941698
12207. the matter of sympathy of the academic	professors for art objectives also must be taken into account.	3.8958670202051926
12208. one technical question of school organization comes to mind here.	6.726590991522132
12209. for	proper accreditation of schools teachers in any course must have	a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate.	3.8067532189648645
12210. since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate	work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed.	6.356064237082914
12211. indeed it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable	schools of art have granted degrees at all.	4.327523624315403
12212. the question however	cannot be ignored for long.	5.993389942908337
12213. the basic problem involved is that a college	setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty	for the advanced degree.	3.489807174893487
12214. most professors in the course must naturally	again have a higher degree than the course offers.	6.4937569913121465
12215. one solution	is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute.	4.89685217349866
12216. it is a sort of academic ring-around-a rosy and you solve it.	6.544573996184066
12217. this brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general.	4.622295622428167
12218. only the independent art schools that is those not connected	with any university or college receive severe and separate investigation	before accreditation by the various regional organizations.	5.010879268498717
12219. it has	been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation	for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of	their fine arts department.	3.4231835746499684
12220. this plus the habit of many schools of	simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics	department yet nevertheless claiming that they teach interior	design has contributed to the low repute of many university courses	in interior design.	4.73485297869344
12221. in spite of this many universities offer adequate	and even distinguished courses in the subject.	4.08569160341411
12222. there will be	no mitigation of these offences until all art schools whether independent	or attached to universities have separate accreditation- as do	medical schools- by an art accreditation group such as the national	association of schools of art.	5.074997939520392
12223. independent art schools	granting degrees must naturally follow this with academic accreditation	by the appropriate regional group.	3.512214470560463
12224. how long has it been since you reviewed the objectives	of your benefit and service program?	5.561810275114532
12225.  have you permitted it to become	a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee	morale and consequently increased productivity?	3.855558788945028
12226.    what	effort do you make to assess results of your program?	6.336443083837594
12227.  do you measure	its relation to reduced absenteeism turnover accidents and grievances	and to improved quality and output?	3.610558001105446
12228.    have you set specific	objectives for your employee publication?	7.1008162354510205
12229.  is it reaching these	goals?	6.888675105893965
12230.  is it larger or fancier than you really need?	7.017295178403161
12231.  are you using	the most economical printing methods paper etc.	4.3582669211956935
12232. are there other	cheaper communications techniques that could be substituted?	7.46292449853538

12335. workers usually think	more of a plan they contribute to.	3.9829334228420072

12354. this will cut the expense of vacation replacements.	7.926763513567822
12355. and with	the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice	vacation dates.	4.048752204719522
12356. also make sure you have reasonable requirements	as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a	vacation.	5.8564057726895005

12360. the early years of the twentieth century seem very far away.	6.52052467939683
12361. but with	all the changes in philosophy dress and terrain- a few things remain	constant including the devotion of americans to the great field	sports hunting and fishing.	3.579308421770618
12362. as the generations move on clothes	become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports.	6.091697041770191
12363. sporting	firearms change markedly for the better.	4.443799683480962
12364. just as modern transportation	has outmoded the early studebaker covered wagon the demand of	today's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment.	5.1586705424927
12365. the american firearms and ammunition manufacturers through	diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle	loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders	extremely accurate bolt lever and slide action firearms.	2.948979240861796
12366. and	millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition	designed for today's hunting and target shooting.	5.0351541797282495
12367. and due	to modern resource-use and game management practices there is still	game to shoot even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and	water.	3.398477695338904
12368. present conservation practices regard wildlife not as an expendable	natural resource but as an annual harvest to be sown and also	reaped.	5.06980378229233
12369. unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states	on shooting preserves	for five and six months each year.	3.3861898862547384
12370. close to two million	game birds were harvested on 1500 commercial and private shooting	preserves and on state game commission-controlled upland game areas	during the 1960-61 season.	4.710889314767548
12371. the shooting development program of the	sporting arms and ammunition manufacturers' institute has successfully	published these facts in all major outdoor magazines many national	weeklies and the trade papers.	3.139992088550796
12372. the most effective way to	develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly	managed shooting preserves.	5.141918573333043
12373. this has been the aim of the director	of the shooting development program the new york staff of the sportsmen's	service bureau and the saami shooting preserve	field consultants since the start of the program in 1954.	4.20499803717665
12374. following	the kick-off of saami's shooting development program	in 1954 a most interesting meeting took place in washington d c.	5.418453459278326
12375. the group known as the american association for health physical	education and recreation	initiated a conference which brought together representatives	of the national rifle association saami and the american	fishing tackle manufacturers.	3.3464821457582703
12376. this meeting was called to	determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as	the outdoor education project.	5.365270188080951
12377. the outdoor education project	took cognizance of the fact so often overlooked that athletic	activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship	to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life.	3.2667335409627003
12378. the	various team sports assuredly have their place in every school and	they are important to proper physical development.	5.2546963898627865
12379. but with the exception	of professional athletes few contact sports and physical education	activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of	the average american man or woman.	3.392879001835229
12380. following a vigorous campaign	of interpretation and leadership development by oep director	dr julian smith today thousands of secondary schools colleges	and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical	education and recreation programs.	4.543782414481813
12381. saami's financial support	since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education.	4.041701281502663
12382. personnel assigned through the shooting development program have	proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops at which	hundreds of school administrators teachers professors and recreational	leaders have been introduced to outdoor education.	4.642599086536531
12383. considering	that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths the project	and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more	to reach.	3.153526162715752
12384. in 1959 saami's shooting development program	announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys	and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in	the shooting sports.	4.855979108762839
12385. this program is now nationally known as teen	hunter clubs.	4.261279264886502

12390. saami's	field men have served as consultants andor have participated in	75 teen hunter club activities which have reached over 40000 enthusiastic	young americans.	4.893097850142573
12391. through the efforts of saami's	shooting development program these shooting activities and many	others including assists in the development of public and privately	financed shooting parks trap and skeet leagues rifle and pistol marksmanship	programs have been promoted to mention only a few.	3.237287773757842
12392. the	continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will	assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made	aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities	for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand.	5.054932820998302
12393. while individual	sportsmen are aware of this situation too many of our political	social educational and even religious leaders too often forget it.	3.9243701547552816
12394. help	is needed from dealers at the grass-roots level.	5.977409524857134
12395. the american	gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program	through their industry trade association.	3.0348622878374028
12396. since saami's	conception in 1926 and more specifically since the adoption of the	shooting development program in 1954 millions of dollars and promotional	man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot	for more youths and adults.	5.37496151444015
12397. we trust that you as a gun and ammunition	dealer have benefited through additional sales of equipment.	3.9152013091331037
12398. are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports?	6.889291346219299
12399.  are you looking	ahead to the exploding market of millions of american boys and	girls who will grow up to enjoy a traditional american way of life-	ranging the fields with a fine american gun and uniformly excellent	ammunition?	3.558846875381757
12400.    is your	sporting firearms and ammunition department	primed for the expanding horizons?	6.796156613203461
12401.    would you like to	organize teen hunters clubs shooting programs and have information	on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags	on shooting preserves?	3.375645357388806
12402.  ask sammy shooter.	9.069291285356353
12403. we were camping a few weeks ago on cape hatteras campground in	that land of pirates seagulls and bluefish on north carolina's	famed outer banks.	3.464064339822712
12404. this beach campground with no trees or hills presents	a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual	use.	5.100009150065276
12405. with the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety	of canvas shelters in which americans are camping now.	3.990123240193523
12406. there were	umbrella tents wall tents cottage tents station wagon tents pup	tents pop tents baker tents tents with exterior frames camper trailers	travel trailers and even a few surplus parachutes serving as	sunshades over entire family camps.	4.574362550749146
12407. moving around camp we saw	all kinds of camp stoves lanterns coolers bedding games fishing tackle	windbreaks and sunshades.	3.239655378125894
12408. we saw similar displays in the other	three campgrounds in this 70 mile-long national seashore recreation	area.	5.328066604869895
12409. dealers would do well to visit such a campground often look	at the equipment and talk with the campers.	3.743300135921738
12410. here you begin to appreciate	the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry.	5.849786112124905
12411. camping is big and getting bigger.	4.728689016295775
12412. no one knows where it will	stop.	8.926269807080029
12413. almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement	of americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of	all outdoor markets.	3.820319227197851
12414. you read various guesses on how many americans	are camping.	6.909558293052031
12415. the number depends on who is talking at the moment.	3.8675265301050876
12416. the	figures range as high as 15 million families.	6.961186956095611
12417. i've heard 10 million	mentioned often but i'm more inclined to think there may be a	total of some five to seven million families camping.	3.346881750280977
12418. seven million families	would total 30 million americans or more.	6.321843110765044
12419. consider the equipment	needed to protect this many from the weather to make their cooking	easy and their sleeping comfortable.	3.769258354163644
12420. harassed state park officials often have more campers than they	know what to do with.	5.634868390758197
12421. they are struggling to meet the demand for camping	space but families are being turned away especially on holiday	weekends.	4.041107470342211
12422. the national parks always popular camping places are facing	the same pressure.	5.350106228799652
12423. the national park service hopes by 1966 to	have 30000 campsites available for 100000 campers a day- almost	twice what there are at present.	3.1319466666240388
12424. the u s forest service cares	for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 national forests	and is increasing its facilities steadily.	5.090889252351998
12425. but the campers still	come.	6.025589127465838
12426. they bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding.	6.04049635744137
12427. they bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits.	4.020304591575923
12428. they come prepared for family fun because americans in ever-growing	numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation	that becomes a family experience of lasting importance.	5.684504881004328
12429. keep coming	there are a half dozen reasons helping to account for	the migration to the campgrounds.	4.164447149364797
12430. among them according to the u	s department of commerce are:	higher pay	earlier retirement and more education.	6.709094818281746
12431. the more people learn about	their country the more they want to learn.	3.8386553109466335
12432. camping is family fun	and it is helping more americans see more of the country than they ever	saw before.	6.313923224237751
12433. but make no mistake about it the first reason	people turn to camping is one of economy.	4.473913530587775
12434. here is the promise of a vacation	trip they can afford.	7.614918213386263
12435. the american automobile association	computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile comes	up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29.	3.4841646599986773
12436. the aaa	then splits it down this way: $10.	5.172948260873388
12437. 50 for lodging	$7 for gas and oil and $2 for tips and miscellaneous.	3.909889327757317
12438. what does	the camping couple do to this set of figures?	6.556145054631241
12439.  the $9.	4.8421318479324045
12440. 50 for lodging	they save.	8.883765099888047
12441. because they prepare their own meals they also keep in	their pockets a good portion of that $10.	3.933421683262047
12442. 50 food bill along with most	of the tip money.	6.6320216822223825
12443. the automobile expenses are about the only vacationing	cost they can't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping	along the way.	3.077365007658351
12444. where americans used to think of a single	vacation each summer they now think about how many vacations they	can have.	5.992713692390266
12445. long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or	four days several times a year.	4.254655987100347
12446. and even if they stay in resorts part	of the time they might if the right salesman gets them in tow develop	a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip	into the wide open spaces.	4.962440245220183
12447. it would be a mistake to sell those	thousands of beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts	of home.	4.028671597220154
12448. home is the place to find the comforts of	home.	8.421330837685176
12449. they're buying fun and adventure and family experiences.	4.110530342376973
12450. but	it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable	camping has become.	6.191340303887116
12451. this is no longer a way of life for the bearded	logger and the wandering cowboy.	5.155434097028467
12452. today's campers want comforts and	they have them.	5.965453839410583
12453. and this helps explain why so many people are now going	camping.	4.844635889933231
12454. it's fun and it's easy- so easy that there is time	left after cooking and tent keeping for the women to get out and	enjoy outdoor fun with their families.	5.344606600641618
12455. camp meals are no great	problem.	4.774329399298572
12456. neither are beds thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags.	6.245038572997091
12457. neither are shelters because there is one to meet the needs of every	camper or prospective camper.	4.719574943962614
12458. but there is still the sometimes	complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for	their individual needs.	6.327541342988991
12459. throughout history the man who showed superior performance has become	the commander of others- for good or bad.	3.932383228352465
12460. since the industrial	revolution when factories emerged this classical pattern has been	followed.	5.9871797516645495
12461. there have always been tales	of disillusionment- the competent technician who became an administrator	willingly or not and found he didn't like it; the scientist	who rebelled against the personnel and paper work; and much more	commonly in recent years the engineer who found that other duties interfered	with- or eliminated- his engineering contributions.	3.255785401764148
12462. there	have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into	very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work to their own and	the public's dissatisfaction and loss.	5.149136478711639
12463. this has been more	evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased	technology.	4.055086805633382
12464. the remedies have been many and varied- attempts to	teach management techniques- either in plant at special schools	or	in university crash courses- provision of management-trained assistants	or associates.	4.234661643585177
12465. but the realization has been growing that	these are not the complete answer.	4.6503347967132855
12466. some men have no talent for or	interest in management; forcing them into management can only create	trouble.	5.329840752592647
12467. the old shop adage still holds: a good mechanic is usually	a bad boss.	3.367283412080365
12468. yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition	of managerial status as the gage of success.	5.34460120812782
12469. labor fights to	change its collar from blue to white.	4.0663000487731695
12470. all grades of management seek	more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures.	5.65772227952236
12471. as several	recent books have over-emphasized we have become the most status-conscious	nation in the world.	4.04369728335486
12472. what can be done for	the individual contributor who is extremely important- and	likely to be more so- in the operation of the technically oriented	company?	6.070900745127707
12473.  he is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and	outside; usually concerned about america's belief that attainment	and success are measured in dollars and titles.	3.643180790696585
12474. yet titles are traditionally	given only to management men and income tends to rise with	title.	5.733628603347422
12475. even the college professor in america has been affected.	5.106806815234535
12476. it is as one engineer says indeed a difficult thing for the	engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he	could employing managerial skills.	5.318196501238607
12477. this difficulty arises even though	we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course.	3.826203985524786
12478. this	leads one to conclude as you have that there is inevitably more	prestige in a management position in the minds of our people.	6.202516273656083
12479. nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than	engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers.	4.046861400025329
12480. so we asked such	men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on	the dual-road-up problem- and more importantly- their solutions.	5.331060469586306
12481. in the paragraphs that follow we quote from 32 men who are identified	on the final page.	3.7100723527116015
12482. among	the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of	general electric.	5.636699735212698
12483. this is not a mutually exclusive plan; there	is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the	technical or the managerial path upward.	3.6076011202329097
12484. further the management path	does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by	the more technical path.	5.603586611380253
12485. it is common to shift back and forth working	up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions.	4.072155702403132
12486. actually there are a number of individual-contributor	positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide services	operation that are filled by men with successful managerial	experience who are currently broadening their capabilities.	5.467620598437606
12487. also	moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's	recognition as a technical expert.	3.6772005635364065
12488. as examples at ge: glen	b warren formerly manager of the turbine division widely recognized	as a turbine designer.	5.321388461061565
12489. the late w r g baker a pioneer	in television design and long-time vp + gm of the electronics	division and later by his own choice an individual consultant.	3.0999751515273415
12490. harold e strang expert in switchgear design for a long period	vp + gm of the measurements + industrial products division	and who currently approaching retirement is vice-president and consulting	engineer in the switchgear + control division.	4.467974574767081
12491. in	the ge plan a number of individual contributors have positions	and compensation higher than those of many managers.	4.236009700548319
12492. these positions	carry such titles as:   consultant- advanced development	consulting engineer   consulting engineer- heat transfer	consulting electrical engineer   senior electrical	engineer   senior physicist   westinghouse has a similar	system with two classifications representing various levels of competence	on the strictly technical side: consulting engineer or scientist	as the case may be and advisory engineer or scientist.	4.116420894185222
12493. many	companies have systems particularly in r + d which work more	or less well depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on	the part of administration as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent	quotations.	3.132220222002793
12494. another factor that may hold hope is for parallel	recognition is as one man says it: h that the fad for educating	top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically	trained approach.	4.8219221266422565
12495. one company instituted	early in 1959 a vertical classification system consisting of four	levels.	3.9153822738494
12496. there is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks;	the top non-supervisory level senior staff engineer enjoys status	and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision.	5.300634025156387
12497. the second level senior engineer rates slightly below first-level	supervision.	4.031310156834131
12498. the expectation is that first-level supervisors will	be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third	engineering level with very few coming from the first level.	4.87413013668055
12499. the company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for	non-supervisory engineers but probably not into executive levels.	3.306567451474484
12500. in this organization about half of the engineers with 15 or more	years of employment are in supervision engineering or elsewhere.	5.801432271273994
12501. this	reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products- which	are not military.	3.6488225930678557
12502. several other examples:	we have over 20 divisions- each of which has an engineering	department headed by a chief engineer.	5.609680071301171
12503. we have set up a central r	+ d department as well as engineering-management departments-	about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants.	4.023608467880106
12504. a separate research department is of course confined to new or future	designs.	6.146935431528997
12505. part of this headquarters staff however are engineering	managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters	management.	3.832688654424758
12506. these headquarters engineers headed by the vice-president-	engineering counsel and advise divisional managers and chief	engineers on product problems as well as aid with design; and many are	engineers who have been advanced from the divisions.	5.144113243031115
12507. these men are	considered managers of engineers.	5.237428708218889
12508. they must learn to wear several hats	so to speak working with management sales and engineering problems	related to the product.	5.340396000324439
12509. we do not have people in our organization	termed 'consultants' or 'fellows' who are specialists	in one particular technical subject.	4.030260297865849
12510. i suppose it is because we are	just not big enough.	7.0069895448982304
12511. we have a few 'consultants'- retired engineers	retained and called in on certain problems.	4.3851099219237515
12512. the only 'fellows'	in our company are those who have been honored by asme aiee	or aiche h i am sure that the engineer who enters	management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities	than he would have as a technical specialist- because of his wider	accountability.	5.703716774553421
12513. we have tried to make both	paths attractive so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction	in either.	3.889885519031503
12514. one way to formalize this is in the job structure.	8.576528238577074
12515. we have these positions which compare directly: f   above	these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president	of engrg r + d.	3.49038248055649
12516. the latter jobs include major management	responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily	through the engineering-management side h we have not yet	succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable	to our higher levels of management but i believe we will trend	top	job: research scientist we	initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons h the	highest position is known as a 'research scientist'.	4.73132433527928
12517. this approach	has not been entirely satisfactory.	4.607241225962676
12518. the primary deterrent appears to	lie with the technical people themselves and their concept of what	constitutes status in present-day society.	4.779031145458936
12519. scientists who agitate	hardest	for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept	it h we have discovered that the outward trappings such as private	offices and private secretaries are extremely important; and although	we have attempted to provide these status symbols support of the	'dual-ladder' plan has been half-hearted h despite the creation	of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that	of men in top managerial positions.	2.9635924534245484
12520. a serious problem	accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly	defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level.	5.139526887729072
12521. with no set standards there is the tendency to promote to the	next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless	of performance h promotion is too often based on longevity and	time in salary grade instead of merit.	3.464542431436758
12522. if no specific organization	plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level	the result is a department top-heavy with high-level high-salaried personnel.	5.463690871440582
12523. we have two approaches	for the technical man: the position of staff engineer which	is rated as high in salary as department manager; and an administrative	organization to take the routine load away from department managers	and project engineers as much as possible thus allowing them more time	for strictly technical work.	3.4210511842698965
12524. these are only halfway measures and	the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man	in industry h to progress without limit in salary and prestige.	5.164477363720939
12525. we have made limited application of the 'parallel	ladder' plan.	4.656476730768363
12526. the highest rated non-supervisory engineering	title is 'research engineer'.	5.233328211202656
12527. the salary schedule permits remuneration	greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering	supervision.	4.01759091691836
12528. we also have an 'engineering	section head- research engineer' classification which has salary	possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer.	5.896977739608586
12529. above this	point there is no generally used parallel ladder.	5.125526742442139
12530. we also	do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a	'professional'	and also to give public recognition to individual technical	competence.	5.623793380136858
12531. these include encouragement of and assistance	to the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers.	3.7648247005854563
12532. we have two media for publicizing individual technical activity a magazine	widely distributed both within and without the company and an	information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes	of all engineers.	4.881195711509325
12533. publicity is given to the award of patents to	our egnineers and financial support is provided for individual membership	in technical societies.	3.5261771136357245
12534. a recent and more pertinent action	has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the	vice-president for engineering.	5.63876147509172
12535. this function is staffed by engineers	chosen for their technical competence and who have the title member	of the technical staff'.	3.5985938520517515
12536. salaries compare favorably with those paid	to the first two or three levels of management.	6.337235787654919
12537. additional symbols	of status are granted such as reserved parking distinctive badge passes	authorizing special privileges and a difference in the treatment	of financial progress through merit.	3.243710979020337
12538. we presently are involved	in inaugurating a new development center.	6.546366839356184
12539. operations of this nature	offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status.	3.8807857322080905
12540. all scientific	staff members will have the title 'research-staff member'.	7.55675515635135
12541. the salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the	scientific community's acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific	field.	3.4292716874297633
12542. contrary to usual organization-position evaluations	the position to which research-staff members report administratively will	not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member	therefore are not necessarily evaluated as highly.	4.746737692122024
12543. these	recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number	of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence.	3.814557615569279
12544. it	is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result	entirely from company efforts.	5.879808341629166
12545. fundamental to the difficulty of creating	the desired prestige is the fact that in the business community	prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that	one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in	the management functions.	3.6863164300614377
12546. sixty miles north of new york city where the wooded hills	of dutchess county meet the broad sweep of the hudson river there	is a new home development called oakwood heights.	5.596175455052851
12547. as a matter	of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated	county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages	in the $14000 range.	3.818125744698883
12548. but oakwood heights is unique in one particular	h its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line	that starts at a central storage point.	5.137360779884573
12549. this is a pilot operation	sponsored by a new entity chartered in delaware as the tri-state	pipeline corporation with principal offices in new york state.	3.81704637280191
12550. its president is otis m waters partner in the law firm of timen	+ waters 5404 chrysler bldg new york city.	5.242677908108515
12551. vice-president	is louis berkman and the secretary-treasurer is mark ritter.	3.7789628545438556
12552. ritter is the builder of oakwood heights and president of kahler-craft	distributors inc newburgh ny.	5.603546909269145
12553. the idea	of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty.	3.7056907321290296
12554. not a year goes by but what several local companies in the u s	and canada even overseas write to fueloil + oil heat to inquire	if it's feasible and where it is being done.	5.511991587761372
12555. its editors only	knew of one example to point to a public housing development of 278	homes in new haven described by john schulz in the march 1950 issue.	3.674747200218539
12556. this has survived the years but there has been considerable concern	among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered.	6.559501372679517
12557. rather	the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis	of number of rooms and persons in the family.	3.5017940238212883
12558. common complaints	included mrs murphy leaving her windows open all the time	a fresh air fan or the family was visiting aunt minnie with	the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil.	4.678085209936676
12559. as a	result of that attitude others have been discouraged from trying central	distribution.	4.3719486380066686
12560. a new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks	the situation at oakwood heights.	5.885037084410476
12561. called a slo-flo meter	it was designed for this job by power plus industries of los angeles	a key individual being don nelson.	3.5342101527910317
12562. tri-state has acquired	its exclusive distribution for the northern principal heating states.	5.398421792074097
12563. there's an advantage in having a firm like tri-state headed	by a lawyer.	3.6863402157463114
12564. the earlier new haven development was public housing	so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture.	5.00300962443254
12565. these	have to do with property rights municipal official attitudes and	a host of others.	3.8999788050750053
12566. in working out the practical legal conclusions president	waters was not thinking only of this pilot project for it is	planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments	nationally.	4.920932964765168
12567. it is always difficult or at least time-consuming	to get approval of any kind of line under a public street as one	example.	4.148846538079388
12568. to overcome this the builder lays and completes the street	himself then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual	easement for the oil lines.	5.241148178520346
12569. when a family buys a home the title is subject	to a perpetual easement to tri-state.	3.8772702384380615
12570. for the central storage	tri-state buys one acre buries its tanks and simply holds permanent	title to that piece.	5.359596477832471
12571. in other words the whole storage and pipeline	system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather	to tri-state.	3.9239553258622974
12572. how does tri-state get its revenue from this	plan?	7.015874203425897
12573.  it leases the whole facility to a large oil company at least	large enough to have a strong credit position.	4.347171198373951
12574. this first test is	being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least	15 years.	5.3306719275353895
12575. the amount paid by the oil company to tri-state for the use	of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all	the homes is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable	to both parties.	3.3676842109439282
12576. on this first venture the central storage is	20000 gallons in two tanks or an average of 400 gallons for each of	the 50 homes.	5.716969233323237
12577. the supplier delivers at his convenience in transport	loads so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather	contingencies.	3.101808525541292
12578. however that is not all he has to do.	9.2599421840061
12579. he must	undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine	heating.	3.8393095425454984
12580. in the present project the heating is by circulating hot water	form paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot	water hookups.	5.04108364517002
12581. again the oil man must read the meters at such intervals	as he finds best.	4.0557489784476255
12582. for this first development the supplier	signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being	transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor.	5.305945091744384
12583. the major	gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor	apparently can do well because delivery cost is low.	3.3607685040619506
12584. considerations	the officers of the new corporation have naturally	explored many angles as well as personalities that might be affected.	6.584265769938656
12585. for example the officials of poughkeepsie town where the	project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow	clearing problem.	3.6493921420201927
12586. the central storage is near a main artery quite	easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing with fewer	trucks in the residential streets.	4.624605085253399
12587. the public service commission	has ruled that this is not a public utility subject to	their	many regulations.	4.347777155111843
12588. several financial institutions both banks	and insurance companies have been sounded out.	5.9013060632016305
12589. they like it and would	supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong	oil companies.	4.8253572380666325
12590. the government housing agencies consider it	feasible with one special stipulation.	5.487361957446755
12591. there must be a restriction in	the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the	current market price for the oil h an obvious precaution since the	account is permanently wedded just like with gas or electricity.	3.561699982784422
12592. for a few details of the system h the lines are 1-14''	x-tru-coat a product of republic steel corp and all lines	are welded.	5.990422121324087
12593. they are laid a minimum of 24'' deep and in some	areas four feet down particularly under roads to stay clear of all	other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy	trucking.	3.378334237369435
12594. the meter is mounted high on the basement wall.	5.630795248463957
12595. its figures	are a half inch high and very easy to read even into tenth gallons.	3.9396764503201362
12596. it will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour.	6.579248138210147
12597. ritter the builder is convinced that the total cost of all the	heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than	would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters.	3.486804426392985
12598. he believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder	developments where gas is available.	6.342340601252802
12599. it would be pretty	difficult to install a tri-state system in old neighborhoods and that's	an understatement.	3.8600213433969457
12600. the job of getting property easements and street	easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging.	5.003702346537959
12601. but in a new development where everything starts from scratch	the solutions are simple.	4.638923768877344
12602. what does tri-state actually	want to do now that it has the meters under franchise and certain	phases of its piping system in the patent applied for stage?	5.622292182281328
12603. 	it wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including	its facility in their new home projects by financing and installing	the storage piping and meters and leasing these for 15 years	with renewal options to a strong oil company.	3.0853076137911564
12604. it may also work in one	other way- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters	letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities.	5.445022354889083
12605. this whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers	for the idea has so often been mentioned somewhat wistfully.	3.9839563137177367
12606. but it's too early yet to go visit oakwood heights.	6.200654993015951
12607. only eight of	the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on	june 8th; others were building.	3.996572132881255
12608. the big tanks were at the site but	still sunning themselves.	6.333317267959409
12609. a big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches	and the town building inspector was paying a friendly if curious	visit.	3.2958082794832926
12610. the oilheating industry is looking up led by a revival	of research and development.	4.966408570224933
12611. a primary ingredient in these fields	is imagination and tri-state pipeline corporation deserves a	very good mark.	3.374985852658701
12612. every year about this time national gargle your cooling	system week rolls around.	5.87130348515721
12613. it pays in the long run to take good	care of the water works.	4.872538674938746
12614. do it this way for the summer gargle:	first drain that old coolant down the storm sewer.	6.494111101952181
12615. don't	save the anti-freeze even if it the expensive permanent type.	4.136738630657867
12616. the word means it won't boil away easily nothing else.	5.384162717558169
12617. the rust	inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year and you don't want	to risk the rust that two years' use could mean.	3.05447605695909
12618. if a lot of rust shows in the drain use a good flushing cleaner.	6.752433325919737
12619. then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor.	4.949584272122403
12620. of	course you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators.	6.3739725412573955
12621. now check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections	around the freeze-out plugs gaskets water pump seals and heater	fittings.	3.26332414596727
12622. next run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat	opens and then look for leaks again.	5.868355137331864
12623. be sure the bugs and	dirt are blown out of the radiator fins.	4.757166039344813
12624. use the air hose for this job.	7.842621636936157
12625. check the temperature gage and be sure it is working.	4.9500372675962065
12626. if you	use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as dowguard	be sure to check it.	6.5820313702782505
12627. dow says that the fluid can be used now	for two years.	4.616577544244403
12628. check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in	during the summer.	6.027308885785384
12629. take precautions now to be sure you avoid	those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms	this summer.	4.010936974398695
12630. pull the thermostats	out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours.	5.161822105188758
12631. spring and summer may be here officially but those thermos stay	in.	4.03608647915459
12632. the fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from	any water cooled vehicle will greatly increase the fuel consumption	reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation	of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators.	4.553100688123422
12633. if you	run into excess plug fouling on one truck check to be sure that the rig	has a thermostat.	4.17427928475983
12634. the thermostat is important to get your engine up	to operating temperature quickly and to keep it running at its most	efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant.	4.981715015453931
12635. for your truck insurance?	5.782583204336787
12636.  there's	a good chance you are doubling on some coverage not taking discounts	coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut.	5.230116677220377
12637. have a talk with your insurance agent.	6.0257624818029685
12638. be careful that you keep	adequate coverage but look for places to save money.	6.290791846308174
12639. first go over the	type of coverage you now have.	4.393346421016803
12640. look for these features which may mean	you can save:    duplicate coverage.	6.180388634524209
12641. avoid doubling up	on the same item.	4.652117176000124
12642. for example don't pay in a truck policy for medical	coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy.	6.047673544386915
12643. does your policy have a lay-up clause?	5.08434041835856
12644.  this means that	if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days insurance	can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to	you.	5.336977730844497
12645. this applies to repair work or winter storage.	4.46372905309834
12646. the figure	five is important in insurance.	5.9635864316443845
12647. with many company policies you get	a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs.	3.785829153056902
12648. this means either cars	or trucks.	8.034439772202248
12649. discounts run up to 2% of cost.	4.352878285210177
12650. usually premium	reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability	plan.	6.792052410211814
12651. for example: if your bodily injury claims start payment after	the first $250 a 25% premium saving is often made.	3.232967928806922
12652. n the period since the end of world war 2- a period	coinciding	with merchandising demands for the colorful the unusual and the original	in signs and displays- plastics have come on so strong that	today	they are the acknowledged leaders in the field.	5.007266642365682
12653. the importance of the	sign industry to the plastics industry however is not in terms of	volume alone.	3.816218301415604
12654. designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing	approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings	of other industries.	5.156137837387888
12655. many of today's developments in thermoforming	stem from original work done with signs and displays; the art of	preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers;	and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons	medallions etc owes much to the field as does the technology	of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent	plastics.	3.2429314868926458
12656. there is much that many industries can continue to	learn from some of the more recent developments described below.	6.759573565677503
12657. the	concept of trans-illumination as just	one example offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems-	no matter what industry is involved.	3.418184597193575
12658. according	to a recent wall street journal survey plastics units now	account for more than 50% of all sign sales.	5.651183721342479
12659. five years ago they had	only 10% of the market with the remainder firmly entrenched in the	stronghold of neon tubing.	4.022505729504851
12660. and it's far from the end for plastics.	7.4829758140762594
12661. industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during	the 1960's will be of plastic construction.	3.554533583291123
12662. evidence of this	trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies	in the field as advance neon sign co los angeles calif.	5.401066120291839
12663. four years ago the company's entire line was devoted to neon	signs; today 85% is in plastics.	4.021356969059433
12664. from the volume standpoint	the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive.	6.675069824134224
12665. aggregate	sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million.	4.002957651412442
12666. currently	there are some 6000 companies in the field ranging from small firms	with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities	for production of metal electrical and plastic components.	5.063445844451292
12667. the trend to plastics?	4.4664591919122465
12668. 	what accounts for the rapid growth	of plastics in the sign and display field?	5.856733249879687
12669.  out of many factors which	might be cited five are most important:  plastics combine	such properties as built-in color light weight optional transparency	or translucency resistance to corrosion as well as the ease of fabrication.	3.420352746498954
12670. according to one	major producer materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately	25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit.	5.268228459081902
12671. shipping cost is	also reduced; a 3-by- 6-ft plastic sign weighs about 120 lb	compared to 275-300 lb for neon.	3.0418493930047505
12672. the weight advantage plus greater	durability of the plastic unit yields a saving of about one-fifth	in shipping.	4.6520020051485025
12673. the lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings	are needed.	3.2408369682261067
12674. finally maintenance costs on plastic signs are	much lower than on fragile neon signs.	5.596050573296643
12675. they offer exceptional	design freedom making it	possible to incorporate contours and details	which give free range to the talents of the designer.	3.291876527116353
12676. vacuum- and pressure-formed	sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded	plastics.	5.647755374985468
12677. pre-decoration	low-cost molds and the freedom to form large	and small thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the	industry.	3.512964619093602
12678. plastics signs work around the clock.	7.185409763519938
12679. internal	illumination protected from the elements gives them powerful visual	appeal at night; during daylight hours their brilliant colors command	attention and interest.	3.172333553879319
12680. advances in equipment and fabrication	techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide	choice of production techniques ranging from injection molding for	intricate smaller-size mass-production signs	to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited	runs.	4.524748941034171
12681. among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field	what plastics	to use?	4.408658711844842
12682.  with its outstanding	optical characteristics weather resistance and formability strongly	dominates the picture.	5.997702418128054
12683. at present both the familiar cast acrylic	and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers	with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total.	3.4871418812005426
12684. of interest is a recent	announcement by du pont's	polychemicals dept of a new methyl methacrylate	monomer designated as monocite h 100 which was developed	specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and	lighting industry.	4.993558513204374
12685. sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs	only one-third as much as glass is impervious to all kinds of weather	and will not yellow.	3.6073649716368323
12686. its high impact strength even at low temperatures	resists chipping cracking and crazing according to du pont.	5.175727302102915
12687. cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed	signs background panels and molded or formed letters because of its	exceptional toughness ease of forming and excellent weathering properties.	3.082622765443591
12688. its clarity and good optical properties are other important	factors.	6.721873257351969
12689. new to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which	the two sheets of the laminate are of different color.	3.9632347536835337
12690. thermoforming	the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical	way to produce a two-color sign.	5.148919318708504
12691. for specialized types of displays such as large three-dimensional	units reproducing a product package human or animal figures	etc reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols	are other materials frequently used.	3.0282509687164
12692. a relative newcomer	in	outdoor signs is mylar polyester film now used as a printed overlay	for trans-illuminated signs.	5.384951514424129
12693. for outdoor signs and	displays where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a	factor the choice of plastics is almost unlimited.	4.10327199210067
12694. here may be found	regular and impact styrene cellulose acetate cellulose butyrate and	cellulose propionate acrylic vinyl expandable styrene foam and polyethylene.	4.834299159954017
12695. the final choice of material depends upon such factors as	costs method of fabrication degree of complexity number of units	required time available for tooling and projected life expectancy of	the unit.	2.999226779955626
12696. often the finished sign or display incorporates several types	of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques.	6.0299560919916875
12697. billboards	one of the most significant advancements in design	of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard now	being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as advance	neon sign co los angeles and industrial electric inc	new orleans la.	3.1906094811464887
12698. the essential difference between the new	trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former	constructed of translucent plastic panels are lighted from within.	4.965333618675165
12699. with the source of light behind the copy there is no loss of lumen output	as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light.	4.033685295609293
12700. also the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure	and cannot obstruct the view of the sign.	6.093722229572465
12701. the copy itself	including any text or illustrations is reproduced in full color directly	on a thin mylar polyester film by a photo screen process.	2.953379676660291
12702. the	film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto	the acrylic panels forming the sign and also to be stripped off for	replacement by new copy as required.	5.391669344101383
12703. spare sets of face panels simplify	the change from one copy or message to another; new panels are exchanged	for the old right in the field on a single trip.	3.4624611847820455
12704. panels with	outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied.	5.42233271349257
12705. signs of this type have already made their appearance	in several larger cities and others are on the way.	4.1158098953852695
12706. it is believed that	these boards will within the next few years replace many of the	conventional flood-lighted boards now in use.	5.658917404345176
12707. trans-illuminated	signs also show versatility in other directions.	4.151551796612721
12708. as used by industrial	electric inc the film panels are printed one at a time as	are 24-sheet posters.	5.81536617300229
12709. thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent	plastics faces; they can also be applied to opaque panels	for use on cutouts or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin	faces.	4.076419544458004
12710. in this way the sign maker has an economical means for displaying	uniform copy on different sign media.	5.819397350166078
12711. recently industrial	electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern	plastic materials- a revolving spectacular sign.	3.551109236866253
12712. comprised of 16	triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections it makes it possible to	combine three different signs in a single unit.	5.605427243659248
12713. the triangles automatically	revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec of viewing time for	each poster subject.	3.0129782804730723
12714. sixteen panels each slightly more than 1-12 ft	wide make up the 25-ft length of the sign.	5.550180262516875
12715. fill many needs	perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility	of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays	would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this	complex field- changeable signs.	3.8024405402151933
12716. signs are meant to convey	a message and in most cases this requires words and letters.	5.825428671614827
12717. frequently	the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products	price changes etc.	3.464723389951378
12718. the huge market for changeable signs has spurred	a universal demand for individual plastic letters in all shapes	and sizes- and a number of companies are set up to supply them.	5.001676225533264
12719. here	are some of the newer items currently available:   poster products	inc chicago ill: a changeable copy and display	sign	which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of	colors onto which are mounted snap-in letters figures or words screened	on acetate or other types of sheet stock.	2.9353148626895917
12720. the background which	is available	in various widths and continuous lengths is extruded with	parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely.	4.271661736357213
12721. the adaptaplex co beaverton ore; letters molded	of butyrate available in several sizes in either red or black.	3.0162949236146464
12722. ideal	for merchandising use they are weather-resistant and have mounting	pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern	background panel.	5.05206656692137
12723. for large letters eg thermoformed	of acrylic or butyrate there are other techniques.	4.190986136833056
12724. for example	in a typical store installation fifty 24-in and six 36-in red	acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background.	4.827380913136934
12725. the fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb each made	it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic	angle brackets cemented to the letters.	3.3830148752437026
12726. stainless steel screws were	used to minimize corrosion stains.	5.91537055401051
12727. for mounting to corrugated plastic	backgrounds very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters	and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings its ends	twisted behind the panels.	3.32511598703164
12728. large injection-molded letters are	also available for sign installations.	5.898474277514521
12729. wagner sign service inc	chicago for example supplies them in several colors in heights of	4 6 8 10 and 17 inches.	3.3630693472631563
12730. they are molded of a special weather-resistant	formulation of tenite butyrate.	6.486760687490441
12731. also available from this company	are snug-grip plasti-bars extruded of transparent acrylic material	which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material.	3.310164770741512
12732. made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft the bars are shaped in cross	section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back	of the letters.	5.088838177418628
12733. still another approach to the changeable letter	type of sign is a modular unit introduced by merritt products azusa	calif.	3.7924001987875355
12734. this vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in	panels formed of 0.	5.714595913435955
12735. 080-in clear butyrate sheet stock masked	and sprayed on the rear side.	3.6722858577870876
12736. finished signs are produced by sliding	the separate letter panels into channels of 0.	5.204085767651358
12737. 025-in aluminum	which may be mounted to various surfaces.	4.000901650569944
12738. the sheets are extruded of	tenite butyrate by jet specialties co los angeles calif.	4.884391065388751
12739. on large-area units where additional structural requirements	are imposed one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed	channels of the acrylic or butyrate.	3.2527357962620007
12740. joined side by side such channels make possible construction	of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft high and	of unlimited width.	4.988138609879819
12741. letters may be wired to the face of the combined	channels painted on the first surface or handled in other ways.	3.998819055604228
12742. from	the inside out	don't insert your components into fixed openings	they may or may not fit; position your components before you close	them in.	5.077451501651899
12743. for example:   don't wall in your kitchen before	you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances.	3.819226278677599
12744. it's a lot quicker	and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect	the end wall after they are all in place.	5.644100687061868
12745. set your bathtub before	you close in the end of the bathroom.	5.124806401688621
12746. don't try to wrestle a	400-lb tub f through a narrow doorway.	5.386023756675499
12747. finish your plumbing	before you frame it in	.	4.344703070834331
12748. finish installing and	connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them	in.	5.271503910165962
12749. there is no better way to waste time than trying to install a	furnace in a finished f closet.	3.978297092457601
12750. don't position your studs	before you insert your windows in conventional construction; that way	you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the	window.	4.543275846304896
12751. you can save all that shimming time if you set your windows	in one two three order- first the stud on one side then the window	then the stud on the other side.	3.7900886677420123
12752. install your disappearing	stair to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before	you drywall the ceiling.	4.958651682864527
12753. don't close in your house until everything	has been carried in.	4.059553086628245
12754. last wall bob schmitt erects is the wall	between the house and garage.	6.43018248918686
12755. that way he can truck his parts right	indoors and unload them under the roof.	3.9939950620090623
12756. no auto maker would	dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons	in the block.	5.5547079109625574
12757. and trailer makers those most industrialized and therefore	most efficient of homebuilders say they save hundreds of dollars	by always building from the inside out.	3.2459454075235183
12758. everything	to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling	offers you	this revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less	news of all because h  it makes it easy to handle much heavier	units so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated	components like those shown in the pictures alongside.	4.985466546274462
12759. it makes materials handling the only construction cost that	should be lower today than in 1929.	4.001513921548878
12760. it changes the answers to who should do what and where?	6.958434762578736
12761. 	it lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases	the chance for shop fabrication where almost everything can be made	better and cheaper.	3.272966470607349
12762. it changes the answers on when to do what	at the site.	6.433598070819041
12763. for example instead of putting in your driveways last	you can now save money by putting them in first.	3.805036814401882
12764. instead of closing the house in first you can	now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to	p	.	5.738803149691838
12765. it changes the answers on builder-dealer relations.	4.930296108621908
12766. not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs	by buying direct and short-cutting the dealer.	5.472797930048306
12767. but now many of	these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming	up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient	specialized equipment	to deliver everything just where it is needed-	drywall inside the house siding along the sides trusses on the walls	roofing on the roof etc.	3.315602145048205
12768. says clarence thompson: we	dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder	cheaper than he could do it himself.	5.119508314693323
12769. the revolution now under	the revolution	five years ago	a house + home round table cosponsored by the lumber dealers'	research council reported unhappily:   only one lumber	dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads; only one box car	in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads; only one producer	in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads; only one builder	in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads.	2.93688620415723
12770. so	from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling	add up to one-fourth of the total construction	cost of housing.	5.375066294269072
12771. that house + home round table	was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials	handling says clarence thompson long chairman of the lumber dealers'	research council.	3.551735066003257
12772. it made our whole industry recognize	the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer carrier equipment	maker dealer and builder all working together to cut the cost	of materials handling.	5.192829048077232
12773. before that we lumber dealers were working	here is where things stand	today: almost all of the 3000 lumber dealers who cater	primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new	houses are mechanized.	3.3902184773194297
12774. there are few areas left where a builder cannot	find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything	at lower cost just where his workmen will need it.	4.988225951527184
12775. practically	all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized	or unitized for mechanical handling- including lumber asphalt	shingles glass block face brick plaster lime hardboard gypsum	wallboard and sheathing cement insulation sheathing floor tile acoustical	tile plaster base and asbestos shingles.	2.7974509797955918
12776. truck and	materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to	meet almost every homebuilding need.	5.088066033802033
12777. for some significant new items	see the pictures.	4.8829466241437105
12778. more than 50% of all lumber is unitized;	an nlrda survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will	strap their shipments for mechanized handling.	5.24555287247133
12779. of these 376 said they	make no extra charge for strapping in standard units because they	save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost.	3.2565188213413134
12780. most of the others	will swallow their 50 to $3 charge rather than lose	a good customer.	5.687739470386367
12781. with a 15500-lb fork-lift dealers can unload	unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for 30mbf compared	with $1.	3.5004155610999717
12782. 65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time says	james wright of nlrda.	5.617477647669438
12783. lumber dealers and lumber	manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments-	48'' wide by a nominal 30'' high	.	3.3950107927106714
12784. these units make it easy to	load as much as 48000 bd ft	car- much more than the average for loose-loaded cars.	6.309973351459748
12785. the	railroads have responded by adding 20000 more box cars with doors 12'	or wider for forklift unloading	and by cutting their freight rates	twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars.	2.9035419598221455
12786. first was a 1958 cut	of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40000	lb; later came a 1961 cut on the west coast	of 7cwt on 70000 lb-plus carloads	more than $4mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70000	.	4.820469795908379
12787. more unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars	and nlrda studies show that flat cars loaded with the new type	6-b floating-load method can be unloaded for at little at 5.	3.460075349061743
12788. for long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof	paper.	6.044475866721185
12789. this costs from 75 to $2.	4.717569647134854
12790. 30mbf but the cover can	these carriers	says nrlda's	james wright: since 1958 carriers that move material	from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes	than any of the dealer's other equipment.	4.51905108855839
12791. the reason: today's	components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled	by a truckdriver and a helper.	3.013440219008705
12792. so manufacturers have pioneered a new	type of vehicle- the self-unloading carrier.	5.712159503837139
12793. it cuts the lumber dealer's	cost because it takes only one man- the driver- to unload	it and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction	of the cost of hand unloading.	3.834744632257588
12794. and it helps the builder because it	can handle a more efficiently packaged load can deliver it to the best	spot and never	takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it.	5.188508596381057
12795. says wright: our survey shows that one third of the	retail	dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling	in the coming two years.	3.6657434445360364
12796. and most of the gain will be in self-unloading	vehicles.	9.313597446341548
12797. to help them waste less of the time you pay for	half the manhours	you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right	so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right	time or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots	or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection or you	bought cheap materials that took too long to fit or your workmen had	to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip.	3.1816212005598032
12798. even america's most efficient builder bob schmitt	of berea hopes to cut his labor costs another $2000 per house as a	result of the time-+-motion studies now being completed on his operation	by industrial efficiency engineers from the stanley works.	4.740433118193379
12799. already	this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from	170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion.	3.363648880022325
12800. builder	eddie carr of washington past president of nahb cut his bricklaying	costs $150 a house by adopting the scr masonry process	worked out after careful time-+-motion studies by the structural	clay products research foundation to help bricklayers do better	work for less.	4.306834382797183
12801. a midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand	bricks from $81 to $43.	3.476918602601506
12802. 50 by adopting this same process cut them another	$7.	6.524388520901749
12803. 50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient easy-to-spot 100-brick	packages.	3.957907322790695
12804. the scr process with its precision corner-posts	its precision guide lines its working level scaffold and its hand-level	brick supply takes eight manhours to get set but once ready	it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day.	4.232377126725034
12805. one good way to cut your labor waste is to make	sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew.	3.8958953292651075
12806. reports	jim lendrum: by studying men on the job we found that two men-	a carpenter and a helper- can lay a floor faster than three.	5.336402702026566
12807. we	found that three men- two carpenters and a helper- can put up wall	panels or trusses more economically than four men- because four men	don't make two teams; they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper	team.	2.951360156103683
12808. we found that wherever you can use two teams on a job	five men not four is the magic number.	5.805323828876804
12809. no house was ever	built that could not have been built better for less if the work had	been better planned and the work better scheduled.	3.8748127875172558
12810. 5: don't waste any 10-a-minute time on green lumber to save 3	a stud	this is the most penny-wise pound-foolish chisel a builder	can commit.	4.816696094913583
12811. green lumber was all very well back in the days	of wet plaster when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then	shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum.	3.383282184036802
12812. but now that all production	builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels	green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford.	5.357571419871114
12813. green	studs cost about 65; dry studs cost less than 3 more.	3.6104539733541188
12814. so if	a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste	even 20 seconds the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry	stud.	4.79357196092845
12815. there comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to	be alone.	5.4552111835055
12816. not necessarily to be off all by ourselves but away from the	crowds and common happenstance.	6.187356512348176
12817. if you've travelled in europe a	time or two it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone	feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the atlantic.	3.638737155182743
12818. following a guide and gratefully so is an excellent way to	see all the important places when everything is strange and new.	5.137245133171434
12819. however	after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas the	places and forums the churches and museums the palaces and castles	and begin to feel at home in the capitals of europe you'll want to	change your course and follow the by-roads at will far from the market	places.	3.1411046177297908
12820. the champagne at troyes the traditional capital	of the champagne country has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has	at a sidewalk cafe on the rue de la paix or at tour d'argent.	4.407519967154956
12821. you	can relive history and follow in fancy the crusaders in their quest	for the holy grail as they sail out from brindisi an ancient	town in the heel of italy's boot.	3.192455611080901
12822. and you don't meet the folks from	home in northwest spain which has remained almost untouched by time	and tourists since the middle ages.	4.9899786970350775
12823. time stands still as you climb	the narrow stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain	slopes or wander through story-book towns perched atop lofty crags	their faces turned to the sea.	3.0551301511971145
12824. they've been there since the days	of the moors and the saracens.	5.660945765304566
12825. and what better way to end a day	than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's	village on the mediterranean?	3.6844072514043065
12826.    an almost too-simple-to-be-true	way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself	behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road.	5.541402084978402
12827. for those	who need or want and can afford another car buying one and driving	it on the grand tour then shipping it home is one popular plan for	a do-it-yourself pilgrimage.	3.3493929550558414
12828. then of course there are those of us	who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car.	6.015015722358989
12829. the answer	to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one.	3.56320649953749
12830. almost any travel agent will reserve	a car for you.	6.408403544359371
12831. you can call one of the car rental services directly	and ask	them to reserve a car of your choice and some transportation lines	offer this service as well.	3.71563416467292
12832. with few exceptions your car will be waiting	for you at dockside airport railroad station or hotel when you	arrive oftentimes at no additional cost.	4.879228343654913
12833. you can wait of course until	you arrive in europe before renting your car.	4.112715979730086
12834. the disadvantages	to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models	readily available or you may have to wait a few days or during the busy	tourist season when cars are in great demand you might find it fairly	difficult to get a car at all.	5.368257102003471
12835. since charges are relatively the	same reserving a car before you leave for europe will assure you of	having one on tap when you want it.	3.474107970558898
12836. for those who plan to travel	to europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer	a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave	it in another city or even another country when you are ready to	return home.	4.917898508249263
12837. at some cities this pick-up and delivery service is without	additional charge and if you are budget-wise when you are planning	your itinerary you will take advantage of these free delivery	and collection stations in major cities within the larger european countries.	3.5933404108665132
12838. international touring documents are usually provided	with the car as are road maps and touring data.	5.206555781649225
12839. a valid american	driving license is accepted in all countries except portugal spain	yugoslavia and eastern	europe.	3.501790499338268
12840. if you plan to visit any of these countries	you can obtain your international driving permit before you	leave at a nominal fee- around $3.	5.427940107494589
12841. your insurance too with	most agencies is provided with the car covering comprehensive fire	theft liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies	in different countries.	3.2648130498927226
12842. if you would feel happier with full collision	insurance there is a small additional charge again varying from country	to country and depending on the term of such insurance.	5.7327936708992695
12843. the average	charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1.	3.3555149616462536
12844. the charge is variable however and goes as low as 50 a day in	ireland and as high as $2.	5.605217223465655
12845. 00 a day in greece.	5.7172650309442306
12846. rental fees	are variable too throughout the countries of europe.	6.215106798863103
12847. there are as	many rates as there are countries and models of cars available.	4.202069756697223
12848. as in	the united states there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus	a few cents per kilometer driven and the per-day rate drops if the car	is retained for a week.	5.241633660252611
12849. it drops again after fifteen andor twenty-one	days.	4.663655469971631
12850. it is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from	80 to 90 for the equivalent of a united states gallon and	while you might prefer a familiar ford chevrolet or even a cadillac	which are available in some countries it is probably wiser to choose	the smaller european makes which average thirty thirty-five and	even forty miles to the gallon.	4.860950332549668
12851. your choice of model will undoubtedly	be governed by the number of people travelling in your group.	4.4629079321241525
12852. with the exception of the sports cars even the quite tiny sedans will	seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage	space for really economical transportation.	5.591906688026772
12853. there is a large variety	of models to choose from in most countries however including 6-passenger	sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn't all that	much greater than for the wee sedans.	3.4306456304048996
12854. the basic costs are generally	pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you	reserve your car but some of them offer supplementary advantages.	5.656294278049981
12855. there is the free intra-city rent it here leave it there service	as an example the free delivery and collection at the airport dockside	or your hotel luggage racks touring documents and information	and other similar services.	3.2901351461974335
12856. a little investigation by telephone or reading	the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these	pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits.	5.058618520214617
12857. the investigation	will be well worth your time.	3.699376133512855
12858. all model cars are not	available in all countries.	6.773049705190936
12859. quite naturally there is a greater availability	of those models which are manufactured within a specific country.	4.0718050852974494
12860. if you would like to start your tour in italy where the rental	fees are actually the lowest in europe fiats in all sizes are available	as are alfa romeo giulietta models.	5.182268210650754
12861. if you wish to budget	closely on transportation saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries	one agency lists the small fiat 500 at only $1.	3.4802022398267103
12862. 26 a day plus 3	a kilometer and the fiat 2100 station	wagon seating six at just	$1.	5.193276508881205
12863. 10 a day and 10-12 a kilometer.	4.599375200619747
12864. if you will be using your car	more than fifteen days which isn't all unlikely the daily rates	drop quite sharply to 86 a day for the fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal	30 a day for the fiat 2100 station wagon.	5.146729421728277
12865. with six in the	group the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily	fee.	3.8541293724751897
12866. in the majority of countries however the rates range from	$3.	6.7922242624521925
12867. 50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7.	4.725174824516332
12868. 00 a day for the larger luxury european models with the rate	per kilometer driven starting at 3 and going up as high as 12.	5.813738554066563
12869. the same model car might be available in six or eight countries yet	not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate	or rate per kilometer driven.	3.528956581622452
12870. the variations are not too great.	6.162368499861331
12871. rates	for american cars are somewhat higher ranging from about $8.	3.9188469403521924
12872. 00 a day	up to $14.	7.833507420260948
12873. 00 a day for a chevrolet convertible but the rate per	kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger european models.	4.214742717816292
12874. rates in greece and finland are fairly high actually the highest	in europe and surprisingly enough they are also quite high in ireland.	5.117658306098156
12875. if you are planning to tour europe for longer than a	month it might be wise for you to lease a car.	4.181406409389278
12876. the actual over-all	cost for the first month will perhaps not be too much lower than the	rental charges for the same period of time but you will receive a new	car.	5.753179155599669
12877. you will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner	which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized	dealers throughout europe.	4.107841227512034
12878. further there is no mileage charge	or mileage limitations when you lease a car and you pay only the flat	monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since	the car is registered and insured individually for your trip.	4.962603494543363
12879. there is	a fairly wide selection of models of english german and french manufacture	from which you can choose from the very small austin 7 citroe^n	2 cv volkswagens renaults to the 6-passenger simca	beaulieu.	3.343879102516823
12880. leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a	car in europe but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical	and satisfactory.	5.423424991682352
12881. after the first month rates are considerably	less averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger	models.	4.045118733790987
12882. there are reasons for some people not wanting to rent	cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan.	5.8564806659727635
12883. for one thing the driver	usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes	pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road.	3.9280269706934736
12884. then	too european drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on	the road and some americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed	up with them.	4.720539077319963
12885. still there is a way for those who want to see some	of the back country of europe by car.	4.925935545011572
12886. the way is to rent a chauffeur-driven	car.	6.861163198259405
12887. it isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be.	4.4685250187950025
12888. your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.	6.954957214090708
12889. 00	a day but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger	cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger peugeot or fiat 1800.	3.481738907046553
12890. the big	spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven being governed by	the rate at which gasoline is consumed.	5.33180440152971
12891. since most european cars average	more miles per gallon of gasoline than american cars it naturally	follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less	but the greater seating capacity of the large american cars will equalize	this provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger	limousine.	3.1112045716787247
12892. the fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars	vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for	the drive-yourself cars.	5.603005932153511
12893. however whether you arrange to have a european	or american model if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity	in relation to the number of people in your party your transportation	expense will average very close to $10.	3.9861119873530364
12894. 00 per day per passenger.	9.34714392042208
12895. this will include your helpful english-speaking chauffeur and a	drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day.	3.8598397490586396
12896. if you drive greater	distances than that you'll just be skimming the surface and will	never discover the enchantment fascination and beauty which lured	you in the first place to explore the hinterlands.	5.277520302003472
12897. of course if you	want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an imperial or cadillac	limousine just for you and your bride you'll have a memorable	tour but it won't be cheap and it is not recommended unless you own	a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the irish sweepstakes.	3.376150660638967
12898. in american romance almost nothing rates higher than what the	movie men have called meeting cute- that is boy-meets-girl	seems more adorable if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct	and acute boredom.	4.929687263094732
12899. just about the most enthralling real-life example	of meeting cute is the charles macarthur-helen hayes saga:	reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts but he said	simultaneously i wish they were emeralds.	3.4332768736035923
12900. aside from the comico-romantico	content here a good linguist-anthropologist could readily	pick up a few other facts especially if he had a little more of the	conversation to go on.	5.868921204042644
12901. the way macarthur said his line- if	you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist- would	probably have gone like this: f primary stresses on emeralds and	wish; note pitch 3 on emeralds but with a slight degree	of drawl one degree of oversoftness h.	2.9670491598194237
12902. conclusions: the people	involved knew clearly the relative	values of peanuts and emeralds both monetary and sentimental.	4.973957465319822
12903. and the drawling oversoft voice of flirtation though fairly overt	was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture.	3.5014279791556993
12904. in	other words like automation machines designed to work in tandem they	shared the same programming a mutual understanding not only of english	words but of the four stresses pitches and junctures that can	change their meaning from black to white.	4.864571715608804
12905. at this point unfortunately	romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture; but consider	if you can bear it what might have happened if macarthur for	some perverse undaunted reason had made the same remark to an eskimo	girl in eskimo.	3.474356113584823
12906. to her peanuts and emeralds would have been just	so much blubber.	6.9932383730275705
12907. the point- quite simply- is this: words they	might have had; but communication no.	2.97131943955155
12908. this basic principle	the first in a richly knotted bundle was conveyed to me by dr henry	lee smith jr at the university of buffalo where he heads	the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics.	4.895375446434066
12909. a	brisk amusing man apparently constructed on an ingenious system of	spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind smith	began his academic career teaching speech to barnard girls- a project	considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about a young	rat named arthur who never could make up his mind.	3.024851478022705
12910. later he	became one of the central spirits of the army language program and	the language school of washington's foreign service institute.	6.176357497064846
12911. it was there in the course of trying to prepare new men for the culture	shock they might encounter in remote overseas posts that he	first began to develop a system of charting the norms of human communication.	3.6686261987160944
12912. to the trained ear of the linguist talk has always	revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker-	such things as geographical origin andor history socio-economic identity	education.	5.069173469174411
12913. it is only fairly recently however that linguists	have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way	that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure	of human communication between two people.	3.4269329177695744
12914. this for obvious reasons	makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric	interview so useful in fact that they have been successfully used	to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy.	5.315190408149501
12915. in the early 1950's smith together with his distinguished	colleague george trager	and a third man with the engaging name	of birdwhistell agreed on some basic premises about the three-part	process that makes communication: paralanguage	a set of phenomena including laughing weeping voice breaks	and tone of voice and kinesics the technical name for	gestures facial expressions and body shifts- nodding or shaking the	head talking with one's hands et cetera.	2.877702639904626
12916. smith's	first workout with stresses pitches and junctures was based on mother	which spells in our culture a good deal more than bread alone.	5.30629334346938
12917. for example if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person there are	certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother.	3.873130883658064
12918. the usual us norm would be: f middle pitches slight	pause before mother slight rise at the end.	4.579210682017689
12919. the symbols	of mother's status here are all usual for culture usa.	3.365043805760392
12920. quite other feelings are evidenced by this style: f note the	drop to pitch 1 on mother with no rise at the end of the	sentence; this is a fade ending and what you have here is a	downtalking style of speech expressing something less than conventional	respect for mother.	5.2166079035387485
12921. even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie	goes with: f in other words the way the speaker relates to mother	is clearly indicated.	3.698939190492467
12922. and while the meaning of the words is not in	this instance altered the quality of communication in both the second	and third examples is definitely impaired.	6.157165301546578
12923. an accompanying record	of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a	throaty	rasp.	3.9361783993916117
12924. with this seven-word sentence- though the speaker undoubtedly	thought he was dealing only with the subject of food- he was telling	things about himself and in the last two examples revealing that	he had departed from the customs of his culture.	5.895831324894765
12925. the joint investigations	of linguistics and psychiatry have established in point	of fact that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words	are involved it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling	over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate	to the rest of the world.	3.347466674505151
12926. since interviewing is the basic therapeutic	and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry the recording of	interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of redstone proportions	in new research and training.	4.996235779087055
12927. some of the earliest recordings	made in the 1940's demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately	to anger and anxiety in the sound track whereas written records	of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which- if	they were at all discernible in print- were picked up only by the most	skilled and sensitive experts.	3.0201296335468975
12928. in a general way psychiatrists were	able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt-	that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic that such	things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not	necessarily by words.	4.690431215584715
12929. at a minimum recording- usually on tape	which is now in wide professional use- brings the psychiatric interview	alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored	repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists.	3.573422679161894
12930. newest	to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have	carried that minimum to a new level.	5.380553768178281
12931. by adding a systematic analysis	with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews they have supplied	a new set of techniques for the therapist.	3.4709695593614063
12932. linguistic charting of	the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs	from expected norms.	4.904449434810866
12933. it flags such possible breakdowns of communication	as rehearsed dialogue the note of disapproval ambivalence	or ambiguity annoyance resentment and the disinclination to speak at	all- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences.	3.04438844118996
12934. interpretation naturally remains the role of the therapist but	orientation- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical	and socio-economic background but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways	of danger spots in his relationship to people- can be considerably	beefed up by the linguist.	4.7887538094174475
12935. his esoteric chartings of the voice alert	the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying	psychological difficulties making them apparent first to the	therapist and eventually to the patient.	3.1094932678286242
12936. in one now-historic first	interview	for example the transcript	goes like this: f the therapist's level	tone is bland and neutral- he has for example avoided stressing	you which would imply disapproval; or surprise which would	set the patient apart from other people.	4.598351707822624
12937. the patient on the other	hand is far from neutral; aside from her specifically regional accent	she reveals by the use of the triad irritable tense depressed	a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity	with literary or scientific language	and she is telling a story she	has mentally rehearsed some time before.	3.013161455495776
12938. then she catapults into everything	and everybody putting particular violence on everybody	indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag- that	is it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up	to this point.	5.23201297153472
12939. consequently it is referred to the therapist for attention.	4.3882436040294115
12940. he may then very well conclude that everybody is probably	not the true target of her resentment.	5.905446813662795
12941. immediately thereafter the	patient fractures her rehearsed story veering into an oversoft breathy	sloppily articulated i don't feel like talking right now.	3.1359745514996877
12942. within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent	to the therapist that everybody truthfully refers to the woman's	husband.	5.947712484770429
12943. she says later but still within the opening five minutes	i keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death.	3.510235288470627
12944. the linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are	all present in the voice chart for this sentence; so are certain	signals that she does not accept divorce.	4.649747974157899
12945. by saying another emotional	death she reveals that there has been a previous one although	she has not described it in words.	4.241388500215118
12946. this the therapist may pursue	in	later questioning.	6.903586247165966
12947. the phrase emotional death interesting and	to a non-scientific mind rather touching suggests that this woman	may have some flair for words perhaps even something of the temperament	regrettably called creative.	3.0263212494315685
12948. since the psychiatric interview	like any other interview depends on communication it is significant	to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked	skill and long experience.	5.458224805646413
12949. his own communication apparatus operated	superbly and lillian ross readers will note instantly its total	lack of resemblance to the blunted monumentally unmeshed mechanism of	dr blauberman.	3.149664710632129
12950. interestingly enough- although none of the real-life	therapists involved could conceivably compare with blauberman-	when groups of them began playing back interviews they discovered	any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview	techniques; almost everyone on first hearing one of his own sessions	on tape expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again.	5.111492457002084
12951. yet in spite of this intensive study of the taped interviews	by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact	that in the first five minutes of an initial interview the patient	often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him;	to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively	or scientifically how to listen.	3.3756434487496274
12952. naturally the patient does not say	i hate my father or sibling rivalry is what bugs me.	5.407778039216425
12953. what he does do	is give himself away by communicating information over	and above the words involved.	3.95548615202342
12954. some of the classic indicators as described	by drs pittenger hockett and danehy in the first	five minutes are these:  stammering	or repetition of i you he she et cetera may signal	ambiguity	or uncertainty.	4.710156883223382
12955. on the other hand significant facts may be concealed-	she may mean i; or everybody as it did with the tense	and irritable woman mentioned before may refer to a specific person.	3.456615452252022
12956. the word that is not used can be as important as the word that	is used; therapist andor linguist must always consider the alternatives.	5.577526806243658
12957. when someone says for example they took x rays to	see that there was nothing wrong with me it pays to consider how	this statement would normally be made.	3.6141638422247366
12958. was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the	fact	h amateur linguists note here that pursewarden in durrell's	alexandria quartet stammered when he spoke of his wife which	is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship.	5.3720127814193255
12959. she was just another freighter from the states and she seemed	as commonplace as her name.	4.346523062546647
12960. she was the john harvey one	of those atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to bari to bring beans	bombs and bullets to the us fifteenth air force to field	marshal montgomery's eighth army then racing up the calf of the	boot of italy in that early december of 1943.	4.717296155681222
12961. the john harvey	arrived in bari a port on the adriatic on november 28th	making for porto nuovo which as the name indicates was the ancient	city's new and modern harbor.	3.135651385216961
12962. hardly anyone ashore marked her as	she anchored stern-to off berth 29 on the mole.	5.14904397985307
12963. if anyone thought	of the john harvey it was to observe that she was straddled by	a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit	the john harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and	whatever else it was that she carried.	3.5157427524920557
12964. it had required the approval of president franklin delano roosevelt	before the john harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of	mustard gas and despatched to the italian warfront.	5.2731434523535015
12965. for in a world	as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud poison gas	was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons.	3.7619490378680545
12966. throughout	the early years of world war 2 reports persisted that the	axis powers had used gas- germany in russia japan in china again.	5.738106569399688
12967. influential people in america were warning	the pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by	the germans in future campaigns.	3.3069819887479825
12968. some extremists went so far as to	urge our using it first.	6.521238412813507
12969. to silence extremists to warn the axis president	roosevelt issued this statement for the allies in august:	from time to time since the present war began there have	been reports that one or more of the axis powers were seriously contemplating	use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices	of warfare.	3.191340847541607
12970. i have been loath to believe that any nation even our	present enemies could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such	terrible and inhumane weapons.	5.584043816045532
12971. however evidence that the	axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an	intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety	of sources.	3.41376768751303
12972. use of such weapons has been outlawed by the	general opinion of civilized mankind.	6.288434656004846
12973. this country has not used them	and i hope that we never will be compelled to use them.	3.889738549691889
12974. i state categorically	that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such	weapons unless they are first used by our enemies.	6.080306968611784
12975. the	following month the invasion of italy was begun and roosevelt gave	effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in	southern italy.	3.2190850963206032
12976. bari was chosen as a depot not only for its seeming	safety but because of its proximity to airfields.	5.841630618951473
12977. any retaliatory	gas attack would be airborne.	5.0656170115315255
12978. it would be made in three waves- the	first to lay down a smokescreen the second to drop the gas bombs the	third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below.	5.17861835323208
12979. so the vile cargo went into the hole of the john harvey.	4.909763766427596
12980. a	detachment	of six men from the 701st chemical maintenance company under	first lt howard d beckstrom went aboard followed by lt	thomas h richardson the cargo security officer.	4.556288991183189
12981. only a few other people- very important people- knew	of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks.	3.986169608239889
12982. no one else must	know.	9.77157309498174
12983. thus in the immemorial way- in the way of the right hand that	knows and the left that does not- was the stage set for tragedy	at bari.	4.209714082298199
12984. it was the night of december 2 1943 and it was growing	dark in bari.	7.011658507107482
12985. it was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the german	me-210	plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit.	3.616122090345861
12986. capt	a b jenks of the office of harbor defense was very	worried.	5.891571112538417
12987. he knew that german long-range bombers had been returning	to the attack in italy.	3.8944294858833843
12988. on november 24th they had made a raid on la	maddalena.	7.528717531630541
12989. two days later some 30 of them had struck at a convoy	off bougie sinking a troopship- and it had been that very night that	the me-210 had made its first appearance.	3.6026329732310556
12990. after it had reappeared	the next two nights jenks went to higher headquarters and said:	for three days now a german reconnaissance plane has been	over the city taking pictures.	5.035082209744597
12991. they're just waiting for the proper	time to come over here and dump this place into the adriatic.	3.64410688830344
12992. but the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist.	5.825505907310181
12993. even though it was known that the luftwaffe in the north was now	being directed by the young and energetic general peltz the commander	who would conduct the little blitz on london in 1944 a	major raid on bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered	seriously.	3.7986760849875685
12994. true there had been raids on naples- but naples was	pretty far north on the opposite coast.	5.957733562935629
12995. no bari was out of range.	6.031731739088835
12996. more than that allied air had complete superiority in the eighth	army's sector.	6.441695103380447
12997. so captain jenks returned to his harbor post to watch	the scouting plane put in five more appearances and to feel the	certainty of this dread rising within him.	3.388321931212554
12998. for jenks knew that bari's	defenses were made of paper.	6.4239624319668245
12999. the royal air force had but a single	light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available.	3.297843596129373
13000. there	were no raf fighter squadrons on bari airfield.	5.785651207150381
13001. the	radar station with the best location was still not serviceable.	4.469056104220164
13002. and everywhere in evidence among the few	remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster- multiple	command.	5.363622307228969
13003. it had been made shockingly evident that very morning	to ensign kay k vesole in charge of the armed guard aboard the	john bascom.	4.071990148371972
13004. a british officer had come aboard and told him	that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs	were actually dropped.	5.740639157964967
13005. then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a	radar-controlled	shore gun firing white tracers.	4.101896569044343
13006. this harbor is	a bomber's paradise the britisher had said with frank grimness.	5.24477793259087
13007. it's up to you to protect yourselves.	4.853816880605944
13008. we can't expect any	help from the fighters at foggia either.	5.907649936533442
13009. they're all being used on	offensive missions.	4.35982897186535
13010. not fire until	the bombs came down! he thought of the tons and tons of flammable	fluid beneath his feet and shook his head.	5.4660113877897505
13011. like hell! like hell	he'd wait- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out?	3.5843550351096285
13012. 	what would his guns guide on then- the north star?	5.5303154086342685
13013.  ensign	vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering	of the bombs and when night began to fall he put seaman 2c donald	l norton and seaman 1c william a rochford on the guns	and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette.	3.2549885091431245
13014. below decks seaman 1c stanley bishop had begun to write	a letter home.	5.7472077218803745
13015. above decks on the john harvey lieutenant	richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and	felt uneasy.	3.844479018782326
13016. there were lights glinting in the city too even though	it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible.	6.450400777386345
13017. bari was	asking for it he thought.	4.89370143477956
13018. for five days now they had been	in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold.	6.176014719754449
13019. richardson wondered	when it would be unloaded.	5.880387300909268
13020. he hoped they would put it somewhere way	way down in the earth.	6.104641842465878
13021. the burden of his secret was pressing down	on him as it was on lieutenant beckstrom and his six enlisted men.	3.6134985659464203
13022. lieutenant richardson could envy the officers and men of the john	harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing	more dangerous than high explosive bombs.	4.957338530840338
13023. they seemed happy at the	delay in unloading glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty	port such as bari.	3.6222255238479737
13024. nine of them had gone down the gangplank already.	7.245286624480556
13025. deck cadet james l cahill and seaman walter brooks had	been the first to leave.	3.6905755540625678
13026. richardson had returned their departing grins	with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in	trade.	5.622545499398308
13027. the other half of the crew plus beckstrom and his men	had remained aboard.	4.7646128304571835
13028. richardson glanced to sea and started slightly.	6.7876392744441345
13029. damned if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor-	porto vecchio.	4.421342065415159
13030. the night was so clear that richardson had no	difficulty making out the silhouette.	5.0706379429866315
13031. then the thought of a cloudless	sky made him shiver and he glanced upward.	4.3541667105378234
13032. it was a clear night and it was raining!   capt michael	a musmanno military governor of the sorrentine peninsula had	also seen and felt the rain.	5.67628250318267
13033. but he had mistaken it for bugs.	5.7288849929649555
13034. captain musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant	name unsinkable had just left porto vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed	olive oil for the sorrentine's civilian population.	4.743550678066721
13035. at exactly 7:30 he felt a fluttering object brush	his face.	4.130432232885482
13036. he snatched at it savagely.	7.327605525649849
13037. he turned the beam of his flashlight	on it.	4.496399241686729
13038. it was the silver foil from the chocolate	bar he had been eating.	7.103521490422327
13039. but how could-?	7.024465626095443
13040.  another	longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth.	6.043733100633731
13041. it was two feet long.	5.378369940371603
13042. it was	not candy wrapping.	9.012324262544134
13043. it was window- the tinsel paper	dropped by bombers to jam radar sets to fill the scope with hundreds	of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers.	3.5547765482489813
13044. fermate!	musmanno bellowed to his italian crewmen.	6.4712784841060635
13045. stop! stop	the engines!   unsinkable slowed and stopped hundreds	of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black the air	raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek the anti-aircraft guns coughed	and chattered- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came	whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor	at bari.	2.7855085435718006
13046. they had come from airports in the balkans these	hundred-odd junkers 88's.	6.285233233469453
13047. they had winged over the adriatic they	had taken bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her	attacking with deadly skill.	3.633019157468629
13048. they had ruined the radar warning system	with their window they had made themselves invisible above their flares.	5.611308045122161
13049. and they also had the lights of the city the port wall lanterns	and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on.	4.2531500072738995
13050. after the first two	were blacked out the third light was abandoned by a terrified italian	crew who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring	homing beacon until british mp's shot it out.	4.7614397101279495
13051. in that	interval the german bombers made a hell of bari harbor.	3.830105773512947
13052. merchant	ships illuminated in the light of the flares made to seem like	stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud were impossible to miss.	5.167232469530496
13053. the little unsinkable sank almost immediately.	3.9438155256833998
13054. captain musmanno	roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for	a raft.	5.549365589080885
13055. they got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few	minutes before their schooner went under.	3.7871685912605924
13056. john bascom	went down early too.	7.823493156044159
13057. ensign vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly	but they had no targets.	3.8722644935383386
13058. most of the junkers were above the	blinding light of the flares and the radar-controlled shore gun had	been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs.	6.089749514948515
13059. vesole rushed	from gun to gun attempting to direct fire.	3.9202694545396635
13060. he was wounded but fought	on.	8.056299002903671
13061. norton and rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors.	3.919667749130131
13062. bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20mm gun pumping out 400 rounds	before sticks of three bombs each crashed into holds one three and	five.	4.557680314376584
13063. now the bascom was mortally wounded.	5.275592799994874
13064. luckily she was	not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt.	5.455706041946196
13065. the order to abandon ship was given but cries of pain could	be heard from the wounded below decks.	3.2958066706223206
13066. there is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at	you wondering why you are staring open-mouthed in amazement.	5.302707731101441
13067. you explain	i have the strangest feeling of having lived through this	very same event before.	4.108889049448937
13068. i can't tell when but i'm positive i witnessed	this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in	the past!   this experience will have happened to many of	you.	4.938218011913309
13069. emerson in his lecture refers to the h startling experience	which almost every person confesses in daylight that particular	passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same	order before whether dreaming or waking a suspicion that they have	been with precisely these persons in precisely this room and heard	precisely this dialogue at some former hour they know not when.	3.018531286848998
13070. most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling	as the deja vue illusion just as they dismiss	dream previsions as coincidences.	5.2824796352375625
13071. in this manner they side-step the seemingly	hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which	all of us grope continually.	3.777879830132899
13072. when a man recognizes a certain	experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream we have an instance	of deja vue	except for the fact that he knows just why the experience	seems familiar.	5.715869313257189
13073. occasionally there are examples of prevision	which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude.	3.6306644098808847
13074. one day maeterlinck coming with a friend upon an event	which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream detailed	the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion	was completely mystified.	4.955625969077858
13075. rudyard kipling's scorn for the jargon	of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered	h how or why had i been shown an unreleased roll of my life	film?	3.0543100426619203
13076.  the famous author tells us of the strange incident in something	about myself.	5.2446186195647755
13077. one day when he attended a war memorial	ceremony in westminster abbey his view was obstructed by a stout	man on his left his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the	rough slab flooring and someone clasping him by the arm whispered	i want a word with you please.	3.2669843862268717
13078. at that moment kipling was	overwhelmed with awed amazement suddenly recalling that these identical	details of scene action and word had occurred to him in a dream six	weeks earlier.	5.191093010469191
13079. freud probably contributed more than anyone else	to the understanding of dreams enabling us to recognize their equivalents	in our wakeful thoughts.	3.34066820923298
13080. however readers who accept freud's	findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of	dreams should ponder over the following words in his interpretation	of dreams chapter 1: h as a matter of fact no such	complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case	and what is more every one attempting such solution has found that	in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream	the source of which he has been unable to explain h nor is the discussion	closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams.	4.889223715300452
13081. dreams present many mysteries of telepathy clairvoyance	prevision and retrovision.	3.7547919603161795
13082. the basic mystery of dreams which embraces	all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical	dream is in the fact that they are original visual continuities.	6.369170690957208
13083. i recall the startling vivid realism of a dream in which i	lived through the horror of the bombing of a little korean town.	3.617309891908758
13084. i am	sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence	so complete in detail from the hodge-podge of news pictures	i have seen.	4.851407573108561
13085. and when psychology explains glibly but the subconscious	mind is able to produce it it refers to a mental region so vaguely	identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably	as part of the individual mind.	3.7880312468641453
13086. skeptics may deny the	more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally	observed but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance	of routine evidence.	4.849124760278557
13087. the question becomes what is	a dream?	4.316861736516849
13088.    is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie?	7.229838942628361
13089. 	every dream and this is true of a mental image of any type	even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful	thought is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available.	3.715495576893251
13090. in most cases we recognize certain words persons animals or objects.	6.321472886526629
13091. but these are dreamed in original action in some particular continuity	which we don't remember having seen in real life.	3.624615353690832
13092. for instance	the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor smith and with	photographic realism sees smith driving the car; whereas it is	a matter of fact that smith cannot drive a car.	4.602701830747402
13093. there is nothing to	suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original	realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams.	3.574185512677056
13094. the entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of	a mental image can find no logical support.	5.022203417183725
13095. a mental image subconsciously	impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful	thought or consciously in light sleep is actually not an image at	all but is comprised of realities viewed not in the concurrent sensory	stream but within the depths of the fourth dimension.	3.217880040910017
13096. dreams	that display events of the future with photographic detail call	for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components including	that weird feeling of deja vue inevitably fantastic though	that theory must seem.	4.957831352173265
13097. as in the theory of perception established	in psycho-physiology the eye is recognized as an integral part	of the brain.	4.406265834223176
13098. but then this theory confesses that it is completely at	a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain.	6.594336595677755
13099. the	opening paragraph of the chapter titled the theory of representative	perception in the book philosophies of science by	albert g ramsperger says h passed on to the brain and there	by some unexplained process it causes the mind to have a perception.	3.3636945707453574
13100. but why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image	within the brain?	6.649208093442388
13101.  as retinal images are conceded to be an integral	function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves between	the inner brain and the eyes carry the direct drive for cooperation	from the various brain centers- rather than to theorize on the	transmission	of an image which is already in required location.	3.295498934739452
13102. hereby	the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen	not the retinal image the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive	cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory	centers motor tensions associated word symbols and consciousness.	5.149742632678392
13103. modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists	of minute waves of energy.	4.068939714475162
13104. we know that the number of radio and	television impulses sound waves ultra-violet rays etc that may	occupy	the very same space each solitary upon its own frequency is infinite.	5.334190187769252
13105. so we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal	apparently momentary states of matter successive one after	another in consciousness but permanent each on its own basic phase of	the progressive frequencies.	3.2824640403081267
13106. this theory makes it possible for any	event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to	consciousness.	5.933887052532146
13107. space in any form is completely measured by the	three dimensions.	4.281373098060214
13108. if the fourth dimension is a physical concept and	not purely metaphysical through what medium does it extend?	5.578355801140897
13109.  it is	not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science	fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past	or the ever-existent past-fantasy future.	3.543761398347073
13110. three seconds flat is the	usual time and the space is crossed by moderate mileage while the	overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static	pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which	perpetuate all events.	4.564556882717985
13111. the body senses and brain in common with	all matter have their counterpart on each of a countless number of	frequencies.	3.267311811263904
13112. the senses in each counterpart bear the impression only	of phenomena that share its own frequency whereas those upon all other	frequencies are invisible inaudible and intactible to them.	4.335509688115124
13113. consciousness	is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory	impressions.	3.856297130191508
13114. when consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the	wakeful world it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present	past and future in a life as vibrant and real as the one left	when the body tired and required sleep.	5.017161742687956
13115. if the photographically	realistic continuity of dreams however bizarre their combinations	denies that it is purely a composition of the brain it must be compounded	from views of diverse realities although some of them may never	be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life.	3.748693483769874
13116. dr	h v hilprecht professor of assyrian at the university	of pennsylvania dreamed that a babylonian priest associated with	the king kurigalzu escorted him to the treasure	chamber of the temple of bel gave him six novel points of information	about a certain broken relic and corrected an error in its identification.	4.539166441787227
13117. as a matter of fact the incorrect classification the result	of many weeks of labor by dr hilprecht was about to be published	by him the following day.	3.839176503775487
13118. some time later the missing part of the relic	was found and the complete inscription together with other new evidence	fully corroborated the ancient priest's information.	5.562133938706209
13119. dr	hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest	in his dream.	4.212599466084911
13120. he was almost positive it was not assyrian nor cassite	and imagined it must have been german or english.	6.363819667122321
13121. we may	conclude that all six points of information ostensibly given by the	dream priest could have been furnished by dr hilprecht's	subconscious reasoning.	3.6090888366282594
13122. but in denying any physical reality for	this dream how could the brain possibly compose that realistic vividly	visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout violent break or	sudden substitution?	4.812749007286091
13123.  which theory is more fantastic: 1.	5.179396599734801
13124. that the	perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions	in the professor's brain or 2.	5.199423453634173
13125. that the dream was a reality on the	infinite progressions of universal gradient frequencies across which	the modern professor and the priest of ancient nippur met?	3.359902527053354
13126. 	the degree of circumstance the ratio of memory to forgetfulness determines	whether a dream will be a recognized fulfilled prevision or	the vaguely effective source of the weird deja vue feeling.	4.615308674409003
13127. no	doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the	sleeper's mind.	3.4262156460893345
13128. probably less than one percent of our previsions	escape final obliteration before we wake.	6.118582261579053
13129. when we arrive at the events	concerned in the vanished majority they of course cannot impress	us as anything familiar.	3.8233264293416465
13130. nevertheless there are notably frequent	instances of deja vue in which our recognition of an entirely novel	event is a feeling of having lived through it before a feeling which	though vague withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive	corps of psychologists.	5.067220250010941
13131. if deja vue is an illusion then peculiarly	it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most	level-headed people.	3.5580492112893056
13132. chauncey depew one-time runner-up for	the republican presidential nomination was attending a convention	at saratoga where he was scheduled to nominate colonel theodore roosevelt	for governor of new york when he noticed that the temporary	chairman was a man he had never met.	4.966071627815495
13133. after the preliminary business	affair was finished depew arose and delivered the convincing speech	that clinched the nomination for roosevelt.	3.4636636108183336
13134. if depew had told any	academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through	that identical convention session at some time in the past he would	have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue.	6.601573939737358
13135. but the famous	orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene.	4.07546272446478
13136. he remembered	exactly when he had lived through it before and he had something	to prove he had.	6.424981574133068
13137. one week before the convention depew was	seated on the porch of a country home on the hudson gazing at the opposite	shore.	3.902688315064883
13138. the food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here!	so wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents	from north country school lake placid new york.	5.583414459556708
13139. in this	one sentence he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition	and psychological programs in operation at the school.	3.4084958871152864
13140. because	the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value care	for its origin and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients	the food does taste good.	4.830603343030829
13141. when served in a psychological	atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from	what they eat because they are free from tension a foundation is laid	for a high level of health that releases the children from physical	handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments the	athletic programs and the most important phase the educational opportunities.	3.3326018725261624
13142. situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain	scenery in the country the school buildings are located amid open	fields	and farm lands.	6.142869441195663
13143. these contemporary structures beautifully adapted to	a school in the country are home to 60 children ages eight to fourteen	grades four through eight.	3.7631995083519194

13145. the director walter e clark believes that a school	with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility	for their welfare.	3.26516498380275
13146. to him this means caring for the whole child	providing basic nutrition and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom	for the development of the mind.	5.680579230256578
13147. the	concept of good nutrition really began with the garden.	4.617754878506273
13148. the school has	always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school.	6.484330613104838
13149. in a climate	hostile to agriculture mr clark has had to keep alert to the	most productive farm techniques.	3.8363680312312116
13150. where a growing season may	with luck allow 60 days without frost and where the soil is poor	sandy quick-drying and subject to erosion many farmers fail.	4.996984946185127
13151. throughout	the adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear	ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat.	3.405897757569021
13152. mr clark	found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing use of chemical fertilizers	and insecticides plus the application of conservation principles	of rotation and contouring did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato	fields and depreciation of the soil.	4.570792951004839
13153. to give up these	notions required a revolution in thought mr clark said in reminiscing	about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began	reading organic gardening and modern nutrition in a	search for help with his problems.	3.196527039121266
13154. louis bromfield's writings	excited me as a conservationist.	7.268224533909321
13155. by 1952 he was convinced he	would no longer spray.	4.435755168733261

13161. it was applied	with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader.	3.864865371279098
13162. years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed	the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity.	5.534397393671158
13163. soon after	the method changed visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate	his soil to keep it looking moist when in reality it was the soil treatment	alone that accomplished this.	3.7429607720245075
13164. to demonstrate the soil	of his vegetable gardens as it is today mr clark stooped to scoop	up a handful of rich dark earth.	5.699414107735731
13165. sniffing its sweet smell and letting	it fall to show its good crumbly consistency he pointed to the nearby	driveway and said this soil used to be like that hard packed	road over there.	3.1928752613863383
13166. people and soils respond slowly says	walter clark but the time has now come when the gardens produce	delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program.	5.317288343575416

13280. public-spirited	backers staked him to a brand-new airplane aimed at putting their	city and state on the flying map.	5.201971330762014
13281. the ship was a waco biplane one	of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled 225hp	wright radial engine known as the whirlwind.	3.559002519827753
13282. a trim green and silver-painted	craft only 22-12 feet long the waco was entered to	compete in the on-to-spokane air derby of 1927.	4.595216823047056
13283. as a matter	of fact fogg and his plane didn't get beyond pennsylvania in the	race- an engine oil leak forced him down- but the flying service	and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his	wry-faced backers.	3.0792798567314845
13284. so with all this experience bob fogg was a natural	choice to receive the first emergency air mail star route contract.	5.874113038788455
13285. his work began just six days after the flood.	4.644067010344561
13286. by airline	from concord to burlington is a distance of about 150 miles counting	a slight deviation for the stop at either barre or montpelier.	4.948281983023737
13287. the first few days bob fogg set his plane down on towne field back	of the state house when the wind was right and used wilson flat	above barre when it wasn't.	3.3773493144649445
13288. between the unsafe towne field and the	long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to	wilson flat arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory.	5.077842746044984
13289. each time in the unhappy pilot pushing his luck begged the postal	officials that met him to find a safer landing place preferably	on the flat-topped hills across the winooski river.	3.463681090590153
13290. but	fogg they countered we can't get over there.	5.790211489932473
13291. and besides you	seem to make it all right here.	5.089219042686107
13292. it took a tragedy to bring things	to a head.	7.207632651967345
13293. after a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind	takeoffs fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage	of an army plane strewn across snow-covered towne field.	3.3653824667196193
13294. sent to	montpelier by secretary herbert hoover red cross aide reuben	sleight had been killed and his pilot lt franklin wolfe badly	injured.	4.88407926995248
13295. with the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply	flown into the hillside.	3.851762478858958
13296. faced with this situation postmaster	charles f mckenna of montpelier went with fogg on a burlington	trip and together they scouted the terrain on the heights	of berlin.	4.890142826965213
13297. a long flat known as the st john field seemed to answer	their purpose and since the winooski bridges were at last passable	they decided to use it.	3.770709872113596
13298. with a wary eye on the farmer's	bull fred somers of montpelier and mr st john marked the	field with a red table cloth.	5.54283281090462
13299. as a wind direction indicator they tied	a cotton rag to a sapling.	3.98171859268004
13300. with these aids and a pair of skiis substituting	for wheels on the waco bob fogg made the first landing on	what is now part of the barre-montpelier airport on november 21	1927.	5.469887578806814
13301. each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail	pouches.	4.233694377907543
13302. during the second week of operations fogg received a telegram	from the post office department asking him to put on two airplanes	and make two flights daily plus one sunday trip.	5.60979451563019
13303. since	fogg's was a one-man one-plane flying service this meant that he	would have to do both trips flying alone 600 miles a day under sub-freezing	temperature conditions.	3.228113430823094
13304. over the weeks america's	first star route air mail settled into a routine pattern despite the	vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation.	5.343693827529969
13305. each morning at five fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into	flying togs over the furnace register of his home.	3.5735116259856765
13306. always troubled	by poor circulation in his feet he experimented with various combinations	of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer's	boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them.	4.406647101013368
13307. a sheep-lined	leather flying suit plus helmet goggles and mittens completed	his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit.	3.259416092781771
13308. the airman's stock answer	to weren't you cold?	5.090789582480587
13309.  became yes the first half hour	is tough but by then i'm so numb i don't notice it!	as daylight began to show through the frosty windows fogg would	place a call to william a shaw at the u s weather station	at northfield vermont for temperature and wind-velocity readings.	3.10280681719213
13310. shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility	by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station.	5.568219325217454
13311. ceilings were judged by comparison with known mountain heights	and cloud positions.	3.729204103199444
13312. later on in the day fogg could get a better weather	picture from the burlington weather bureau supervised by frank	e hartwell.	5.94973220680808
13313. out at the airport each morning fogg's	skilled mechanic caleb marston would have the waco warmed up and running	in the drafty hangar.	3.832723225558418
13314. wishing to show that aviation	was dependable and here to stay bob fogg always made a point	of taking off each morning on the dot of seven disregarding rain snow	and sleet in true postal tradition.	4.709645577455999
13315. concord learned to set its clocks	by the rackety bark of the whirlwind's exhaust overhead.	3.5105088142866947
13316. sometimes	the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog but 85% of his	trips were completed.	5.051759173828613
13317. plane radios were not yet available	and once in the air fogg flew his ship by compass a good memory for	landmarks as seen from above and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick	computation.	3.2104919741079208
13318. often threading through the overcast he was forced	to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling skimming above the winooski	or the white river along the line of the broken railroad.	5.4687570004991874
13319. when	driving rain or mist socked in one valley fogg would chandelle up	and over to reverse course and try another one ranging from the ottauquechee	up to danville in search of safe passage through the mountain	passes.	3.11332657963514
13320. the dependable wright engine was never stopped on	these trips.	4.9774092010941295
13321. it ticked over smoothly idling while fogg exchanged	mails with the armed messenger from burlington at fort ethan allen	and one from montpelier and barre at the st john field.	3.381332236803606
13322. sometimes on a return trip the aviator would go upstairs high	over the clouds.	5.771020163461081
13323. there he'd take a compass heading figure his	air speed and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he'd be over	the broad meadows of the merrimack valley where it would be safe	to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him.	3.6338400886091815
13324. bob fogg didn't have today's advantages of instrument flight	and ground control approach systems.	5.36468440443397
13325. at the end of the calculated	time he'd nose the waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break	through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable.	3.7108857758097122
13326. usually back in concord by noon there was just time	to get partially thawed out refuel and grab a bit of mrs fogg's	hot broth before starting the second trip.	5.125310256276952
13327. day after day fogg shuttled	back and forth on his one-man air mail route until the farmers	in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the	stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country.	3.210455600211369
13328. the	flyer had his share of near-misses.	7.34291744723493
13329. at fort ethan allen the ever-present	wind off lake champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing	like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated.	3.364742219748541
13330. once the soldiers from	the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while fogg revved	the engine and got the tail up.	5.724022561674428
13331. at a nod of his head they let go	turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream.	3.8203492576666287
13332. tracks in the	snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet.	5.994434568762656
13333. one afternoon during a cold powdery snowstorm fogg took off for	concord from the st john field.	3.9834457443708886
13334. re you retiring now?	7.574708789381474
13335.  if so are you saying where did	the last	few years go?	4.406206269177513
13336.  how did i get to be sixty-five so fast?	7.240124985845209
13337.  what do	i do now?	5.885364585632409
13338.    yes retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly.	6.8332107973109135
13339. somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire.	4.078877274166986
13340. we always	thought we would die with our boots on.	6.357366972433173
13341. out of the blue comes talk	of pension plans.	5.827581161443961
13342. compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our	horizon.	5.951872359777324
13343. still it seems in the far future.	5.686031941740749
13344. suddenly one day up it	pops! sixty-five years and you've had it!   so now what?	5.496931295269946
13345. 	oh sure! you've thought about it before in a hazy sort of way.	3.6263452450196727
13346. but! it never seemed real; never seemed as if it could happen	to you; only to the other fellow.	6.130362704658188
13347. now! here it is! how	am i going to live?	4.0350421088118065

13349.  where do i go from	here?	5.7574451268372995
13350.    a great many retired people are the so-called white	collar workers.	6.5465910731799575
13351. are you one of these?	6.056397764189591
13352.    if so you are of the	old school.	8.332307349901706

13356. you never are late	for work and seldom absent.	7.2094102578633095
13357. actually you can take no special	credit for this.	4.998368949980032
13358. it is the way you were taught and your way of	life.	7.682663221406515
13359. all this is standard equipment for a man of your day; your stock	in trade; your livelihood.	4.523633030700477
13360. however the last few years	of your life things seem to be changing.	7.640316277657912
13361. your way doesn't seem to	be so darned important any more.	4.067468659453427
13362. you realize you are getting in the old	fogy class.	7.492773919121762
13363. to put it bluntly you are getting out-moded.	5.060697080531725
13364. what's	happened?	11.55875815210223
13365.  the answer is a new era.	5.205649737117331

13367. the planning dept comes into existence.	3.77434856170172
13368. all sorts of plans come to life.	7.755410103033184
13369. this is followed by a boom in conferences.	5.6555442744583475
13370. yes sir! conferences become very popular.	7.358928025383376
13371. when a plan	burst its seams hasty conferences supply the necessary patch and life	goes merrily on.	3.66295811973169

13375. every retiring person has a different	situation facing him.	4.4923239452690735
13376. some have plenty of money- some have very little	money.	6.77827518094072
13377. some are blest with an abundance of good health- some	are in poor health and many are invalids.	3.7389817913145573
13378. some have lovely homes-	some live in small apartments.	7.130192856153117
13379. some have beautiful gardens- some not	even a blade of grass.	4.277895122071325
13380. some have serenity of mind the ability to accept	what they have and make the most of it	- some see only darkness the bitter side of everything.	5.711450414125342
13381. well whatever you have that's it! you've got to learn to	live with it.	3.985183427451448
13382. now! the question is how are you going to	live with it?	6.05212624411364
13383. 	you can sit back and moan and bewail your	lot.	3.8514454598270436
13384. yes! you can do this.	8.38333907944369
13385. but if you do your life will	be just one thing- unhappiness- complete and unabridged.	4.162807925719221
13386. it	seems to me the first thing you've got to do to be happy is to	face up to your problems no matter what they may be.	6.14793850849521
13387. make up your mind	to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years	of life.	4.1047082354786895
13388. one thing i am sure of you must get an interest in life.	7.657523186777299

13391.    believe me! there are many many things	to do.	4.712608280644275

13395. true! we are not all great	artists.	5.425571380480318
13396. i frankly can't draw a straight line.	6.745252963389156
13397. maybe you are	not that gifted either but how about puttering around with the old paints?	3.9466900056852303
13398. 	you may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it.	5.298991127554889

13406. where sewing is concerned	i'm a total loss.	7.199325951316307
13407. when you see a needle in my hands you will	know the family buttons have fallen off and i have to sew them back on	or get out the safety pins.	4.095443696061974
13408. then again there's always that	lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs.	5.3677457785880565

13417. perhaps you couldn't do that but have you ever tried	to see what you could do with a hunk of wood?	4.04896766008371
13418.  outside of cutting your	fingers maybe you would come up with nothing at all but then again	you might turn out some dandy little gadgets.	5.892308102173443
13419. some women get	a real thrill out of housework.	4.330446585611366

13427. don't be discouraged! this is just being a normal	writer.	4.051494332092684
13428. just let the rejection slips fall where they may and keep	on plugging and finally you will make the grade.	5.590421546769808
13429. few new writers have	their first story accepted so they tell me.	4.0570590025789866
13430. but it could happen	and it may happen to you.	7.568056106196994
13431. then there's always hobbies collecting	stamps coins timetables salt and pepper shakers elephants	dogs dolls shells or shall we just say collecting anything your heart	desires?	3.2189613584186185

13438. they are many and varied.	8.662392835813206
13439. also there's scrap books collecting newspaper pictures and	clippings or any items of interest to you.	3.716497161775376
13440. it's getting interested	in something that counts.	6.552244084676553
13441. as for me i am holding in reserve	two huge puzzles to put together when time hangs	heavy on my hands.	3.769787876110289

13447. the mature	person	is creative.	4.2856344326590365
13448. what does it mean to be creative a term we hear with increasing	frequency these days?	6.1092844928097705
13449.  when we turn to noah webster we find	him helpful as usual.	4.260705700913262
13450. to be creative is to have the ability to	cause to exist- to produce where nothing was before- to bring forth	an original production of human intelligence or power.	5.523620648232751
13451. we are creative	it seems when we produce something which has not previously existed.	4.189593619617459
13452. thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake building	a chicken coop or producing a book to founding a business creating	a league of nations or developing a mature character.	5.171884320329224
13453. all	living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence	the power of creativity if it is only to reproduce a form like their	own.	3.624925610015563
13454. while man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors	in the evolutionary process he is the only animal with a true	non-instinctive and conscious creative ability.	5.685182847666607
13455. an animal bird or	insect creates either a burrow or nest or hive in unending sameness	according to specie.	3.355376257558046
13456. man's great superiority over these evolutionary	forbears is in the development of his imagination.	6.672528251415202
13457. this gives him the	power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories ideas	and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment	in new and ever-changing forms.	3.3558927601182447
13458. t has been	truly said	that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting	this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world.	4.7997021854158834
13459. in our	own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a jules verne	come into actuality.	3.8515873029871046
13460. the vision of a lord tennyson expressed in a	poem 100 years ago took visible form over london in the air blitzes of	1941.	4.947762130920113
13461. in fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's	projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more.	3.919272880673509
13462. it	is in this one aspect at least that man seems to be made in the image	of his creator.	7.4655376641533975
13463. not only can man project his imagination	out into his environment in concrete forms but even more importantly	he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself.	3.3454886864051763
13464. we recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training	can become athletes acrobats dancers musicians and artists developing	many potentialities.	4.98532766638262
13465. we know that actors can learn to portray	a wide variety of character roles.	4.633419989026116
13466. by this same combination of the	will and the imagination each one of us can learn to portray permanently	the kind of character we would like to be.	6.192112979576868
13467. we must realize with	prof charles morris in his the open self that man is the	being that can continually remake himself the artisan that is himself	the material for his own creation.	3.384838470618925
13468. o far in	history man	has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment	rather than first creating the sort of person who can make	the highest use of the things he has created.	5.296152257621667
13469. is not the present world	crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us	and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall	the tragedy.	3.6280786210115505
13470. is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend	our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our	own maturing process?	5.277094009462398
13471.    sir julian huxley in his book uniqueness	of man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in	being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood	under family protection so is he the only animal who has a long	period after the decline of his procreativity.	3.449704417277685
13472. some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples	are a thing of the remote victorian past; that nowadays all honeymooners	are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough	from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all	the anxiety and hazards out of the situation.	4.9286808643371405
13473. perhaps- but extensive	discussions with contemporary practitioners family doctors and	gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance.	3.640957436308944
13474. joking and talking may be freer and easier but the important factual	information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men	and women.	4.921507498512807
13475. various factors in the setting can still be of great	advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad	memory for one or both.	3.959339856598609
13476. privacy must be highly assured both in time and	place.	6.177129799370118
13477. that is locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of	location but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough	for an utterly unhurried fulfillment.	3.9000815634571047
13478. if the wedding party lasted	late and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before	resuming the trip or making an early start the husband may forestall	tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying	in each other's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours.	4.807123531580651
13479. the	consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long	private time for that purpose.	4.1061975700251665
13480. first intercourse	for the bride brings with it the various problems connected	with virginity and the hymen.	6.085918781512517
13481. one thing should be clear to	both husband and wife- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur	when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act.	3.622636895966334
13482. ignorance on this	point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety misunderstanding	and suspicion.	6.323844150427625
13483. the hymen is in essence a fragile membrane	that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most	female human beings who have not had sex relations.	3.6713779314131236
13484. often it is thin and fragile	and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse.	5.647848443426334
13485. as might be expected girls in this situation bleed very little	and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity.	4.37480705060138
13486. it is also important to realize that many girls are born without	a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one; so that the absence	of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex	relations.	5.566807127177128
13487. but there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations	of the folk-lore beliefs.	4.649010067015592
13488. some hymens are so strongly developed that	they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked	loss of blood.	5.061527309321753
13489. more rarely the hymen is so sturdy that it does not	yield to penetration.	4.548444836936855
13490. extreme cases are on record in which the	doctor	has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital	relations to be consummated.	5.35817990962569
13491. these cases for all their rarity are	so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general	population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen	is a serious problem to newly-weds.	3.240514323483344
13492. in recent times when sexual	matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly	the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention.	5.117157041945059
13493. obviously the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new	situation.	4.125677344209195
13494. is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of	making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride?	6.206196121758312
13495. 	gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride	should consult a physician before marriage.	3.352441279377173
13496. if he foresaw any problem	because of the quality of the hymen it was recommended that simple	procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or preferably	to dilate it.	5.38561977700082
13497. as a natural outgrowth of this approach it was	often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for	painless intercourse by dilating the vagina.	3.609089488076495
13498. this recommendation	was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth	consummation of the sex act.	7.036135653077931
13499. the vagina is an organ capable of	remarkable contraction and dilation.	3.4098528503398704
13500. this is obvious when it is remembered	that during childbirth the vagina must dilate enough to permit	the passage of the baby.	5.82614291849019
13501. the intricate system of muscles that	manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under	voluntary control.	3.153902870721574
13502. but an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious	intention of the woman.	5.8858265029707075
13503. that is when first penetration takes	place the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the	vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent	further pain.	3.437625433722951
13504. the advantages	of dilatation by the physician	are both physical and psychological.	4.920998700314293
13505. since it is a purely professional	situation none of the pain is associated with love-making or the	beloved.	4.772856195964309
13506. by using instruments of gradually increasing size the vagina	is gently and with minimum pain at each stage taught to yield to	an object of the appropriate shape.	4.9943318772938285
13507. in this process the vaginal	muscles come under better conscious control by the girl.	3.964360242518802
13508. she learns	how to relax them to accept- instead of contracting them to repel	the entering object.	5.353923440080857
13509. apart from the standard problem of	controlling the vaginal muscles other serious barriers may exist that	need special gynecological treatment.	3.431146249200286
13510. it is far better to have such	conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon	where they can create a really serious situation.	5.663033515799947
13511. when no	medical problems exist the newly married couple generally prefer to	cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves.	3.5524014749836756
13512. special	information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still	of great value.	5.408312448616001
13513. folk-lore superstition and remembered passages from	erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly	taken as scientific facts and useful hints.	3.1975993384548493
13514. the importance	of loving tenderness is obvious.	5.335789381682267
13515. the long unhurried approach and	the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels.	3.388485293949497
13516. under	the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes	and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases providing an excellent	lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration.	4.681136968747366
13517. extensive	observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established	the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall	may cause	a great deal of distress in a virgin.	3.4118755833795404
13518. but during the same examination	two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall	without any pain; and in	fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all	times.	5.017768876616339
13519. these regional differences of sensitivity to pain may	be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse.	3.5574120962076163
13520. the husband	and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in	mind.	4.987516286746208
13521. they may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too	much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina; at	least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer	a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making.	3.156255524392623
13522. in	fact the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely	adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon.	4.979908426174987
13523. locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing	the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration.	4.040938600884697
13524. the false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain	while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased	with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling	the problem once and for all.	4.428152568625939
13525. such talk is seriously in error.	5.258556165260846
13526. ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride	both physically and psychologically.	6.217570531990815
13527. the insistent forceful penetration	may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage	to the hymen.	3.27277991571608
13528. the pain and distress associated with	the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital	relations and cause her unconsciously to make the sex act unpleasant	and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate	his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it.	4.422871169503529
13529. serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in	the honeymoon situation.	4.308883744420833
13530. the necessity for keeping alert to his bride's	hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous	desire.	5.049888749207523
13531. the emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience	a premature climax.	3.483387667483027
13532. this is a very common experience and should in	no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife.	5.781330748152214
13533. or the	frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of	the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him	to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period.	3.379174572879152
13534. the signals	to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to	take advantage of them.	5.043801862580296
13535. the best course is to recover his physical	excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again.	3.7021619334190463
13536. this	may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding	and self-centered.	5.580212238388097
13537. he can take security from the fact that the	progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost.	4.571404763439777
13538. now while he uses talk caresses or requires caresses from her his bride	will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him	restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they	both so eagerly desire.	4.700804520858818
13539. the accumulated information	on this point shows that first intercourse even when it is achieved	with minimum pain or difficulty is seldom an overwhelming sexual	experience to a woman.	3.237900961692182
13540. too many new things are happening for it to	be a complete erotic fulfillment.	6.199037141088443
13541. only under rare circumstances	would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse.	3.852694213889628
13542. both	man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax and	even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that	the wife may be cold or frigid.	5.70493528159804
13543. if the early approaches are wise	understanding and patient the satisfactions of marital fulfillment	will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older.	3.4126630447887547
13544. writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures	titled the nude: a study in ideal form kenneth	clark declares: h the human body as a nucleus is rich in associations.	5.241303820827547
13545. h it is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things	we wish to do with ourselves.	4.5762916363460295
13546. perhaps this is a clue to	the amazing variety and power of reactions attitudes and emotions precipitated	by the nude form.	6.076380235951941
13547. the wide divergence of reactions	is clearly illustrated in the kinsey studies in human sexuality.	3.1764791702236983
13548. differences were related to social economic and educational backgrounds.	6.413756198980781
13549. whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt	to avoid or be shocked by nudity those educated beyond the eighth	grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations.	3.043518338684302
13550. such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating	thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that	her husband had never seen her entirely naked while another woman	boasting an equal number of years of married life is proud of having	shared the nudist way of life- the really free natural nude	life- for most of that period.	4.813775864595846
13551. attempts at censorship always	involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions.	3.537517728261576
13552. the indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude	human form as lewd	and pornographic a threat and danger to all the young or good	or religious or moral persons.	4.517141369581704
13553. the equally ardent proponent	of	freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the	natural honest free expression of man's spirit and the epitome	of beauty and inspiration.	3.0812750118193297
13554. one is always a little surprised	to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected.	6.932149778538663
13555. i	still recall the mild shock i experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic	advocate of the clean healthful free way of natural life	in nudism who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution	in fine spirit.	3.000700349954221
13556. in tradition and in poetry the marriage bed is a place	of unity and harmony.	5.786000746714786
13557. the partners each bring to it unselfish love	and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy.	3.1729137987883496
13558. at its	most ecstatic moments husband and wife are elevated far above worldly	cares.	6.171526135664942
13559. everything else is closed away.	5.572778991421115
13560. but marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy	are seldom achieved.	5.584945156515656
13561. instead one partner or the other dominates the	sexual relationship.	5.182333904316591
13562. in the past it has been the husband who has been	dominant and the wife passive.	7.574925057158192
13563. but today there are signs that these	roles are being reversed.	4.541863794080571
13564. in a growing number of american homes	marriage counselors report the wife is taking a commanding role	in sexual relationships.	5.731928083491286
13565. it is she who decides the time the place	the surroundings and the frequency of the sexual act.	4.169330469000714
13566. it is she who	says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics-	not the husband.	5.1240677399552395
13567. the whole act is tailored to her pleasure	and not to theirs.	3.71376664817269
13568. beyond a certain point of course	no woman can be dominant- nature has seen to that.	5.578078996035102
13569. but there is little	doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed.	4.6555502580872785
13570. of course there remain many old-fashioned marriages in	which the husband maintains his supremacy.	6.024516748560963
13571. yet even in these marriages	psychologists say wives are asserting themselves more strongly.	4.099390246856826
13572. the	meekest most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's	or grandmother's standards.	5.465404771035803
13573. to many experts this trend was	inevitable.	5.26896106509582
13574. they consider it simply a sign of our times.	7.207628228037489
13575. our society	has emancipated the woman giving her new independence and new	authority.	3.9328939799636364
13576. it is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual	role.	6.964247322531119
13577. the sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum	declares dr mary steichen calderone medical director of the	planned parenthood federation of america and author of the recent	book release from sexual tensions.	3.3539578495585918
13578. it reflects what is going	on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself.	6.911621871949945
13579. a world	in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual	relationships in which wives are more self-assertive too.	3.69712779070836
13580. yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination	of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy	and even dangerous.	5.429175696079779
13581. it can in fact wreck a marriage.	5.498335387169962
13582. when	a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires she	is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her.	4.77965686773829
13583. and she begins to regard him as savage bestial and unworthy.	4.15765349307896
13584. on the other hand wifely supremacy demeans the husband saps his self-respect	and robs him of his masculinity.	5.59338072526936
13585. he is a target of ridicule	to his wife and often- since private affairs rarely remain private-	to the outside world as well.	3.7813441738949103
13586. a marriage can survive almost	any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's	maleness declares dr calderone.	4.882388640672071
13587. this opinion is supported	by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists dr maurice	e linden director of the mental health division of the philadelphia	department of public health.	3.6779074906511857
13588. when the roles of	husband and wife are reversed so that the wife becomes leader and the	husband follower dr linden says the effects on their whole	relationship sexual and otherwise can be disastrous.	5.171146545895285
13589. in one extreme case cited by a pittsburgh psychologist an office	worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband	unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded.	3.3289824467060827
13590. to win her favors her	husband first took an additional job then desperately began to embezzle	from his employer.	5.33099930662866
13591. caught at last he was sentenced to prison.	4.528468744460724
13592. while	he was in custody his wife divorced him.	6.079217460689394
13593. more typical is	the case of a suburban long island housewife described by a marriage	counselor.	4.366261161179347
13594. this woman repeatedly complained she was too tired	for marital relations.	5.8901027464074005
13595. to please her her husband assumed some of the	domestic chores.	4.345220125218496
13596. finally he was cooking washing dishes bathing the	children and even ironing- and still his wife refused to have relations	as often as he desired them.	5.190954128099104
13597. one wife described by a	new york psychologist so dominated her husband that she actually placed	their sexual relationship on a schedule writing it down right between	the weekly pta meetings and the thursday-night neighborhood	card parties.	3.1210773292794123
13598. another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis.	6.801083109516058
13599. after	every money argument she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the	matter was settled in her favor.	3.335882391083463
13600. experts say the partners in	marriages like these can almost be typed.	5.830069053163132
13601. the wife is likely	to be young sophisticated smart as a whip- often a girl who has sacrificed	a promising career for marriage.	3.4540018216535637
13602. she knows the power of the	sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband.	6.992907949923189
13603. the husband	is usually a well-educated professional preoccupied with his job-	often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is: don't	rock the boat.	2.9413277269975993
13604. sometimes this leads to his becoming	demandingly dominant in marriage.	7.079510774311626
13605. hemmed in on the job and unable to	assert himself he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one	area.	4.174688840710766
13606. more often though he is so accustomed to submitting	to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule	at home.	6.398472736941623
13607. some psychologists in fact suggest that career-bound	husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their	wives.	3.6183314754273805
13608. the wife's attempt at control these psychologists contend	is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay	as much attention to her as he does to his job.	4.663767620843197
13609. naturally no	woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative.	4.147370556271173
13610. unless her	husband also desires sex the act cannot be consummated.	6.198464763762459
13611. generally	however in such marriages as those cited the husband is at his wife's	mercy.	4.09980290342919
13612. the pattern says dr morton	schillinger	psychologist at new york's lincoln institute for psychotherapy	is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly virtually	trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight	is the night.	4.379718086268852
13613. no one seriously contends of course that	the domineering wife is sexually speaking a new character in our world.	3.758754431014941
13614. after all the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic	figure of long standing in literature and on the stage as dr schillinger	points out.	5.790781862707507
13615. there is no evidence that these milquetoasts	became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master	bedroom.	3.834227031438473
13616. furthermore dr calderone says a certain	number of docile retiring men always have been around.	5.452896329359967
13617. they aren't	frigid and they aren't homosexual; they're just restrained	in all of life.	3.672790245798677
13618. they like to be dominated.	10.192926576624991
13619. one such man once	confided to dr theodor reik new york psychiatrist that he	preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor.	3.7425790142174225
13620. asked why he replied	primly: because that's no activity for a gentleman.	6.175603297149522
13621. but such cases were in the past unusual.	6.350609296857811
13622. society here and abroad	has been built around the dominating male- even the bible appears	to endorse the concept.	5.036723377109263
13623. family survival on our own western frontier	for example could quite literally depend on a man's strength	and ability to bring home the bacon; and the dependent wife seldom	questioned his judgment about anything including the marriage bed.	3.207740680060894
13624. this carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early	20th centuries when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring	life with father manner.	5.2329999500027204
13625. in those days a wife had mighty	few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere.	3.819322926166776
13626. grandma wasn't expected to like it dr marion hilliard	the late toronto gynecologist once summed up the attitude of the	'90s.	5.271058262398424
13627. wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as	used by their husbands- and history indicates they often quite	literally were.	3.6261143875773887
13628. when was the turning point?	8.319711993157291
13629.  when did women	begin to assert themselves sexually?	4.90222415245833
13630. 	some date it from	woman suffrage others from when women first began to challenge men	in the marketplace still others from the era of the emancipated flapper	and bathtub gin.	4.563869950005603
13631. virtually everyone agrees however that the trend	toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with	the postwar rush to the suburbs.	3.385375278170152
13632. left alone while her husband	was miles away in the city the modern wife assumed more and more duties	normally reserved for the male.	5.914154074622872
13633. circumstances gave her almost undisputed	sway over child-rearing money-handling and home maintenance.	3.726405631558437
13634. she found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was	once considered too helpless.	5.851790302177162
13635. she liked this taste of authority and	independence and with darkness was not likely to give it up.	4.281526475291294
13636. very few wives says dr calderone who balance the checkbook	fix the car choose where the family will live and deal with	the tradesmen are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned.	4.941705921897125
13637. a woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the	sexual relationship as well.	3.6324956365333194
13638. and an additional factor was	helping to make women more sexually self-assertive- the comparatively	recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response.	5.067402146128281
13639. marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the	importance of the female climax.	3.7194398441248357
13640. they began to describe in detail the	woman's capacity for response.	6.283543315556846
13641. in fact the noted psychologist	and sex researcher dr albert ellis has declared flatly that	women are sexually superior to men.	3.5476762797629435
13642. according to dr ellis	the average 20-year-old american woman is capable of far greater sexual	arousal than her partner.	5.5213376709003565
13643. not surprisingly dr ellis says	some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities.	3.8962855344207097
13644. yet paradoxically according to dr maurice linden many	wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them.	5.519005160319127
13645. an aggressive	woman wants a man to demand not knuckle under.	4.480960584997945
13646. when the husband	becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness dr	linden says the wife in turn finds him inadequate.	5.900320179980778
13647. often she	fails to gain sexual satisfaction.	5.009851384586942
13648. one such wife dr	linden says became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through	a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger	man.	5.1062164193255
13649. but her personality was such that each affair lasted only until	that lover too had been conquered and reduced to passivity.	3.4807317825257202
13650. then the	wife bed-hopped to the next on the list.	7.039997363104261
13651. in some cases however	domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary triggered	by a passing but urgent emotional need.	3.9019096992144435
13652. thus a man who is butting	a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed-	the one place he can still be champion.	5.710178650947254
13653. if his on-the-job problems work	out he may return to his old pattern.	4.389236700500109
13654. sometimes a burst of aggressiveness	will sweep over a man- or his wife- because he or she feels	age creeping up.	5.337389360864461
13655. on the other hand a husband who always has	been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive- asking	psychologists say for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable.	3.369271489062384
13656. or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted flattered	or coaxed simply because she needs her ego lifted.	5.3253969207350025
13657. in any case	dr calderone remarks such problems are a couple's own affair	and can't always be measured by a general yardstick.	3.614479882012355
13658. as long	as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex it makes little	difference if one or the other dominates dr calderone declares.	5.775236152313701
13659. the important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment.	4.402586296117395
13660. other experts say however that if sexual domination	by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period	it is likely to shake the marriage.	5.823197186735839
13661. and just as domination today often	begins with the wife so the cure generally must lie with the husband.	3.7548513115360054
13662. to get a marriage back where it belongs comments dr	schillinger of the lincoln institute the husband must take	some very basic steps.	5.763430349199485
13663. he must begin paradoxically by becoming more	selfish.	4.774253980324666
13664. he must become more expressive of his own desires more demanding	and less 'understanding'.	6.42528782834715
13665. too many husbands dr	schillinger continues worry about how well they're doing	and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual	play.	3.469773262572454
13666. she gave herself a title h lady diana harrington.	6.4055222688134705
13667. the new york da gave her another h the golden girl	of cafe society.	3.9111457029490686
13668. houston police gave her a third less flamboyant	title h prostitute.	5.968166363251162
13669. and houston police have the final	say in the matter since she died there on september 20 1960 diane	harris graham 30 doa circumstances- unusual.	3.4505111052236876
13670. early in her life she had discovered that where there were men	there was money and with the two came luxury and liquor.	6.219015290663407
13671. she was still	in the play for pay business when she died a top trollop who had	given the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour.	3.5503730978813537
13672. she never hid the fact that she liked to play.	7.844809797683493
13673. her neighbors	in the expensive houston apartment building told reporters that	the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as	the golden	girl of the mickey jelke trial.	3.1828516924203782
13674. it was the trial of	oleomargarine heir minot jelke for compulsory prostitution	in new york that put the spotlight on the international play-girl.	5.387392542843209
13675. diane was needed as a material	witness in the case and new york police searched three continents	before they found her in their own back yard- in a swank hotel	of course.	3.707195874259502
13676. she had been moving in cafe society as lady diana harrington	a name that made some of the gossip columns.	6.097545520897815
13677. it was when	she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation	she liked best.	3.713299539106936
13678. clad in mink and diamonds she listened to assistant	district attorney anthony liebler describe her to the arraigning	judge:   this girl is the golden girl of cafe society.	4.705897509780364
13679. in 1951 she was a prostitute in new york county.	5.274143450685491
13680. in	the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign	tycoon who took her to france where she later met a very wealthy man	and toured all europe with him.	5.207141602589451
13681. at deauville she met an	egyptian by the name of pulley bey.	4.622298765186771

13683. she was in egypt during the revolution	and had passport difficulty.	4.599042350533516
13684. she lied in order to get it.	8.925237933647535
13685. we	have checked her in different parts of europe and egypt and finally	back into this country h she has been acting as a prostitute.	3.6387734678308825
13686. our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts	to jelke.	6.268905160923628
13687. diane sobbingly denied this to the court.	5.190429707855243
13688. i never gave that boy a cent.	7.360999737025614
13689. i am not a prostitute	and i had only one very wealthy boy friend she said.	4.0800784609558685
13690. during the course of the trial jelke backed up part of that statement.	7.826749111898234
13691. diane is the type of girl jelke said who wouldn't	get loving- even on her wedding night- unless you piled up	all your money in the middle of the floor.	3.657486935185431
13692. but she seemed to	have underestimated the number of her boy friends.	7.017776942785886
13693. she	came to new york from detroit as a teenager but with a sponsor	instead of a chaperone.	4.0332617874698355
13694. as she told it he's a rich boy friend	an old guy about 60.	5.946965089309753
13695. she was mary lou brew then wide-eyed	but not naive.	4.269357669911606
13696. she had talked her boy friend into sending her	to new york to take a screen test.	6.2344984422904055
13697. the screen test was never made- but diane was.	3.6753770524912563
13698. she quickly	moved into cafe society possibly easing her conscience by talking	constantly of her desire to be in show business.	5.521256311968155
13699. she seemed	so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail	circuit set up a practical joke.	4.298328515334197
13700. an ex-fighter was introduced	to her in a bar as mr warfield the famous producer.	5.560985115719884
13701. the	phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows.	5.359519254363483

13703. the	audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment.	4.547775544348345
13704. she	thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show	the eminent producer how well she could dance.	5.2121659559971105
13705. after a few minutes	he said i can't use you if you dance like that.	4.277465962703024
13706. i'd like	to see you dance nude.	6.573840129006047
13707. diane loved	to dance in the nude something she was to demonstrate time and again.	4.115827797842743
13708. she developed another quaint habit.	7.74383305808711
13709. even among the fast set	in which she was moving her method for keeping an escort from departing	too early was unique.	3.659435192315217
13710. when the date would try to bid her	good-night at the door she would tell him if you go home now i'll	scream.	6.024567266782649
13711. more often than not he would bow to the inevitable.	4.685989180039758
13712. one who needed no such threats was a french financier.	6.796160499400445
13713. one of	the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel.	4.421239927924001
13714. she wanted	to go around the world but she settled for a french holiday.	6.722039129646602
13715. in an anonymous interview with a french newspaper the financier told	of spending several months with her.	3.6805562972296686
13716. then she went to deauville	where she met a member of a powerful greek syndicate of gamblers.	6.641138763592011
13717. the greek evidently fell for her monsieur x recounted	and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he	gave her 100000 francs and led her to the roulette tables.	3.201313352106239
13718. she could do no wrong at the tables that time.	6.797266410457938
13719. and in short	order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way.	3.9185441329014665
13720. smarter	than most gamblers she slipped away from the casino packed her bag	and took the night train to paris.	5.357745081212575
13721. no one ever learned what happened	to the greek.	5.0590372479007595
13722. the luxury of paris' most fashionable hotel	the george 5 bored the beautifully-built blonde so she high-tailed	it to rome.	4.510378017316766

13724. to climax her roman revels she	was thrown out of the swanky hotel excelsior after she had run naked	through its marble halls screaming for help.	5.049604854735131
13725. it was a rugged	finish for what must have been a very interesting night.	4.855536355501559
13726. discreet	italian police described it in a manner typically continental.	7.460293602447794
13727. there had been a threesome at the party in the suite's bedroom:	miss harrington	another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and	one of your well-known american actors.	3.768140076657434
13728. the actor had had	much to drink and apparently became very violent.	5.086626578857114
13729. the hotel staff	as well as residents of the excelsior told us they saw that both ladies	were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall.	3.2384265158189036
13730. they were wearing nothing but their scratches.	7.547913653673202
13731. they were	asked to leave the hotel.	5.2980116682081615
13732. the girls	after dressing were indignant.	5.580262346213023
13733. you can't do this to	us diane screamed.	5.064560483317001
13734. in the morning	she found rooms directly across from the excelsior at the equally	luxurious hotel ambassador.	5.59268663617923
13735. with the ambassador as headquarters	she continued to promote good will abroad.	4.318086174868958
13736. of course her benevolence	was limited to those who could afford it but then there is a	limit to what one person can do.	6.299012654535958
13737. by this time diane was a beguiling	lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world.	4.223028517449062
13738. she thought	royal status might come her way when while she was still in rome	she met pulley bey a personal procurer to king farouk of egypt.	4.984434015833595

13743. pulley	bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him the friend	continued.	3.8740128943460244
13744. it seemed as though she were always auditioning.	7.738557750801427
13745. no believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors the plump	pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to cairo where she	waited for nine months vainly hoping to see farouk.	3.2362605467234706
13746. pulley	had set her up at the semiramis hotel but she grew impatient waiting	for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the	royal pimp had no key.	4.779085939767273
13747. she picked her own middle-eastern friends	from the flock of ardent egyptians that buzzed around her.	3.5736625699983993
13748. tewfik	badrawi mohammed gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of	cairo society enjoyed her company.	4.923503788926554
13749. so extensive became her	circle of admirers egyptian police said that her escapades	caused distrust.	3.8118029733791414
13750. the roof was about ready to fall in on diane's	little world but it took nothing less than the egyptian revolution	to bring it down.	5.254931552979189
13751. when farouk was overthrown police picked up	his personal pimp pulley bey.	3.7776582022872587
13752. they also called upon diane with	a request for a look at her passport.	6.824721596259902
13753. the cagey pulley bey	who spoke no english had taken the passport so that diane	couldn't	leave the country without his approval.	3.0703286986788982
13754. officials provided a temporary	passport good only for return to the united states.	7.0329145539385305
13755. and	return to the united states she did into waiting arms- the unromantic	ones of the new york district attorney's office.	4.310420290238736
13756. held	as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of mickey	jelke the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed	to the women's house of detention a terribly overcrowded prison.	4.605028223449292
13757. it is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk	the district attorney into having her removed from the prison to a	hotel room with her meals taken at vesuvio's an excellent italian	restaurant.	3.6216262827178687

13762. houston police got to know diane two years ago	when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring.	5.188949660573018
13763. last may they said she admitted being a prostitute.	4.640648170681421
13764. the	next time the police saw her she was dead.	6.467776415882419
13765. it was september	20 1960 in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles.	3.6530151354868177
13766. she had had a party with a regular visitor dr william w	mcclellan.	7.134277207584689
13767. mcclellan who had once lost his medical license	temporarily on a charge of drug addiction was with her when she died.	3.617735912148516
13768. he had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had	happened during that time.	6.566966087030118
13769. when he realized she was dead he called	two lawyers and then the police.	4.588740524131814
13770. when the police arrived they	found mcclellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently.	5.956265776136342
13771. the blonde's nude body was in bed a green sheet and a pink	blanket covered her.	3.205319682479698
13772. pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the	walls.	6.70808634540778
13773. an autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in diane's	body.	4.324783809494776
13774. police theorize that a combination of dope drink and	drugs killed her.	6.3541779725076015
13775. i think that maybe she wanted it this way	a vice squad cop said.	4.126026253387686
13776. a maid told us that she still bragged	about getting $50 a date.	5.505422618213439
13777. she was on the junk and they slide fast when	that happens.	4.697530744818047
13778. at least she never knew what the bottom was	like.	7.506834183633891
13779. i am a carpet salesman.	6.032938609889947
13780. i work for one of the biggest chains	of retail carpet houses in the east.	7.116402023343708
13781. we cater mostly to nice people	in the $5-8000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy	neon-lit chromium-plated suburban stores.	3.2707879178675445
13782. i am selling the	stuff of which is made one of the great american dreams- wall-to-wall	carpeting.	7.657194485814462
13783. there is only one trouble with this big	beautiful dream.	4.992864001762718
13784. from where i sit it looks more like a nightmare.	7.191263624931851
13785. people come to me with confidence.	5.651726162026209
13786. they depend on my supposedly	expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little.	6.279864379783986
13787. but i knowingly abuse their confidence.	5.2909453750152124
13788. franklin d lee proved a man of prompt action when mrs	claire shaefer accompanied by a friend visited him in bakersfield	california several months ago as a prospective patient.	5.3473264449248195
13789. doctor	lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes.	3.8710546769449183
13790. then	by squeezing her foot three times he came up- presto- with a	different diagnosis with each squeeze.	5.033061020047827
13791. she had- he informed her-	kidney trouble liver trouble and a severe female disorder.	3.7485733311996774
13792. that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because	he knew just the	thing for her- a treatment from his cosmic light ozone generator	machine.	5.276233440486799
13793. as he applied the applicator extending from the	machine- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed	on a rectangular base- to the supposedly diseased portions	of mrs shaefer's body lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific	mumbo-jumbo.	3.0707660038442497
13794. yes the ozone from his machine would cure practically	everything he assured her.	5.96344726889444
13795. did she know he asked why the	colors of the tubes were important to people's health?	3.7285250675137456
13796.  the human	body- he pointed out for example- required 33 units of blue light.	5.0430029109268775
13797. for that reason he informed her the lord made the sky blue.	4.713486713438481
13798. continuing	glibly in this vein he paused to comfort her:   don't	you worry.	5.60568381257192
13799. this machine will cure your cancer-ridden body.	4.2511971006569755
13800. cancer! mrs shaefer practically shrieked.	6.943849176833785
13801. you	didn't tell me i had cancer.	4.703922166423043
13802. you have it all right.	10.596914664073752
13803. but as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing	to worry about.	4.838421232921388
13804. why i once used this machine to cure a woman with	97 pounds of cancer in her body.	5.793535347405878
13805. he urged her to buy one	of his machines- for $300.	4.201285862659323
13806. when she said that she didn't have the	money he said that she could come in for treatment with his office	model until she was ready to buy one.	6.159865521881598
13807. he then sold her minerals to cure	her kidney ailment a can of sage to make her look like a girl again	and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away.	3.202394430032768
13808. lee renewed his pressure on mrs shaefer to buy his machine	when she visited him the next day.	5.521262433591611
13809. after another treatment with the machine	he told her that her entire body was shot through with tumors	and cysts.	3.626243199026157
13810. he then sold her some capsules that he asserted would	take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money	for buying his machine.	4.983994179624878
13811. when she submitted to his treatment with	the capsules mrs shaefer felt intense pain.	4.077527095398989
13812. leaving lee's	office mrs shaefer hurried over to her family physician who treated	her for burned tissue.	5.300628040563263
13813. for several days she was ill as a result	of lee's treatment.	4.298962880555482
13814. mrs shaefer never got around to	joining the thousand or so people who paid lee some $30000 for his ozone	machines.	5.138678885186546
13815. for mrs shaefer- who had been given a clean bill	of health by her own physician at the time she visited lee- and her	friend were agents for the california pure food and drug inspection	bureau.	3.643087922099154
13816. and she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the	evidence of lee's quack shenanigans gathered by the tape recorder	under her friend's clothing proved adequate in court for convicting	franklin d lee.	4.48083683191858
13817. the charge: violation of the california medical	practices act by practicing medicine without a license and selling	misbranded drugs.	3.288545299681176
13818. the sentence: 360 days' confinement in the	county jail.	4.834499926163632
13819. an isolated case of quackery?	5.317868921813544
13820.  by no means.	10.930500734993153
13821. rather	it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic	devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands	of americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them	away from legitimate ethical medical treatment of serious diseases.	3.1220795917015516
13822. the machine quack makes his rube goldberg devices out of odds and	ends of metals wires and radio parts.	4.474377810364134
13823. with these gadgets-	impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs ticks	and buzzes- he then carries out a vicious medical con game capitalizing	on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of	our scientific age.	3.348723397848946
13824. he milks the latest scientific advances translating	them into his own special buck rogers vocabulary to huckster his	fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual	impotence and cancer.	4.443094631637924
13825. the gadget faker operates or sells his	phony machines for $5 to $10000-	anything the traffic will bear.	2.9794889893160654
13826. he	may call himself a naprapath a physiotherapist an electrotherapist	a naturopath a sanipractor a medical cultist a masseur a doctor-	or what have you.	4.6606185776487274
13827. not only do these quacks assume impressive	titles but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific	or impressive foundations-	foundations which often have little	more than a letterhead existence.	3.3716808854056852
13828. the medical device pirate	of today of course is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor	of yesteryear- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and	other patent medicines.	4.7055770142370035
13829. his plunder is therefore far higher- running	into hundreds of millions.	3.7946312443308505
13830. according to the food and drug	administration doctor ghadiali dr albert	abrams and his clique and dr wilhelm reich- to name three notorious	device quacks- succeeded respectively in distributing 10000	5000 and 2000 fake health machines.	4.623902685452191
13831. authorities believe	that many of the doctor frauds using these false health gadgets are	still in business.	3.86436655786756
13832. look at the sums paid by two device quack victims	in cleveland.	6.37090342940596
13833. sarah gross a dress shop proprietor paid $1020 to	a masseur and mr a a laborer paid $4200 to a chiropractor for	treatment with two fake health machines- the radioclast and	the diagnometer.	2.950153464365848
13834. multiply these figures by the millions of people	known to be conned by medical pirates annually.	5.325435930470287
13835. you will come up	with a frightening total.	5.555629246884652
13836. that's why the fda the american	medical association and the national better business	bureau have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery	to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical	charlatans annually.	5.025732303966902
13837. the postmaster general recently reported	that mail order frauds- among which fake therapeutic devices	figure prominently- are at the highest level in history.	3.088586428322101
13838. similarly	the american cancer society the arthritis and rheumatism	foundation and the bbb have each stated lately that medical	quackery is at a new high.	4.847865346026757
13839. for example the bbb has reported	it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and	10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago.	3.683721504860564
13840. authorities	hesitate to quote exact figures however believing that any	sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation- turned up by	their inevitably limited policing- of the real loot of the medical	racketeer.	5.1032039879070314
13841. in this sense authorities believe that all estimates of phony	device quackery are conservative.	4.132272954172452
13842. the economic toll that	the device quack extracts is important of course.	5.220162303280518
13843. but it is our health-	more precious than all the money in the world- that these modern	witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away.	3.7081819357248698
13844. by preying on the sick by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate	by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care these medical	ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity.	4.799146620831608
13845. typically	sarah gross and mr a both lost more than their money	as the result of their experiences with their cleveland quacks.	3.909516389157624
13846. sarah	gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment	by the masseur were not helping her.	5.52717366881085
13847. as a result she consulted medical	authorities and learned that the devices her quack doctor was	using were phony.	3.865917872469104
13848. she suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be	institutionalized.	7.0322985045112665
13849. mr a her fellow townsman also experienced	a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been	bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been	treating his wife- a woman suffering from an incurable disease multiple	sclerosis- and himself.	3.4495587985110845
13850. mr a has recovered but he is	justifiably a bitter man.	6.261040498446898
13851. that's a lot of hard-earned money to	lose he says today.	4.274850685192416
13852. neither me nor my wife were helped by that	chiropractor's treatments.	6.128509606858417
13853. and there was the case of tom	hepker a machinist who was referred by a friend to a health machine	quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what	doctor fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine.	3.681315417044764
13854. after	his pains got worse tom decided to see a real doctor from whom he	learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung.	5.060918386773726
13855. yes tom caught	it in time to stay alive.	5.191497787982213
13856. but he's a welfare case now- a human wreck-	thanks to this modern witch doctor.	5.31636147997011
13857. but the machine quack	can cause far more than just suffering.	4.844438536816299
13858. in such diseases as cancer	tuberculosis and heart disease early diagnosis and treatment are so	vital that the waste of time by the patient with doctor fraud's	cure-all gadget can prove fatal.	5.198311645860069
13859. moreover the diabetic patient who relies	on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake	can be committing suicide.	3.30134651326298
13860. for instance:   in chicago	some time ago mr h age 27 a diabetic since he was six stopped	using	insulin because he had bought a magic spike- a glass tube	about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small	fraction of a cent- sold by the vrilium company of chicago for $306	as a cure-all.	4.513491136637105
13861. hang this around your neck or attach it to other	parts of your anatomy and its rays will cure any disease you have	said the company.	3.100355443060567
13862. mr h is dead today because he followed this	advice.	6.787829859822059
13863. doris hull suffering from tuberculosis was taken	by her husband to see otis g carroll a sanipractor- a licensed	drugless healer- in spokane.	3.191940296378335
13864. carroll diagnosed mrs hull by	taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his radionic	machine and twirling some knobs.	5.0299154341728505
13865. his prescription:	hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water.	3.753507626345016
13866. although	she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him carroll permitted	her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water.	5.1814284507812
13867. inevitably mrs hull died of starvation and tuberculosis weighing	60 pounds.	3.8418744689115756
13868. moreover her husband and child contracted tb	from her.	7.002863708669473
13869. in california a few years ago a ghoul	by the name of h f bell sold electric blankets as a cure	for cancer.	3.991161490648774
13870. he did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric	blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died	reconditioning them and selling them at $185 each.	4.7565472050577835
13871. when authorities	convicted him of practicing medicine without a license	a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of	one of his victims was not around to testify: he was dead of	cancer.	3.403778487227311
13872. by no means are these isolated cases.	8.10112832616877
13873. unfortunately	says chief postal inspector david h stephens who has prosecuted	many device quacks the ghouls who trade on the hopes of	the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the	patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up	in court.	3.0922648267762876
13874. death! have no doubt about it.	7.311151697105308
13875. that's	where device quackery can lead.	4.532984660337616
13876. the evidence shows that fake therapeutic	machines substituted for valid medical cures have hastened the	deaths of thousands.	4.6122171500349705
13877. who are the victims of the device quacks?	5.799681678442819
13878. 	authorities say that oldsters are a prime target.	5.779226821117067
13879. says wallace	f jannsen director of the fda's division of public information:	quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older	people or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis rheumatism	diabetes and cancer.	3.2061242763856947
13880. people who have not been able to get	relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in	by quacks.	6.806033771863875
13881. the victims of the quacks are frequently poor people like	mr a who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice	to doctor fraud's avarice.	3.0367626409903803
13882. they are often ignorant as well as	underprivileged.	7.869335445462904
13883. ten-year-old richard stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome	for almost a year.	3.674185161527078
13884. his grades had gone steadily downhill and	he had stopped bringing	friends and classmates home from school.	5.044792759550847
13885. mr and mrs stewart were puzzled and concerned.	4.626882698566683
13886. then one day	dick's classmate jimmy from next door let the cat out of the	bag.	5.817395884581755
13887. the youngsters in the boys' class had nicknamed dick bugs	bunny because his teeth protruded.	3.2844259294682896
13888. when richard's parents	told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist- a dentist who	specializes in realigning teeth and jaws- their young son was interested.	5.059704871147734
13889. during the year that followed dick co-operated whole-heartedly	with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved-	an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his	facial appearance.	3.446577619570175
13890. richard stewart is no special case.	8.014462421927638
13891. the	majority of children in the united states could benefit by some form	of orthodontic treatment says dr allan g brodie professor	and head of the department of orthodontics at the university of	illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field.	3.862451617722936
13892. what do parents need to know about those years of the braces in	order not to waste a child's time and their money?	6.071696080186159
13893.  how can they	tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment?	4.675198032830457
13894.  why and when should	tooth-straightening be undertaken?	7.804330364095896
13895.  what is it likely to cost?	5.882637166813505
13896. 	occlusion is the dentist's expression	for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed.	5.1142439645020925
13897. malocclusion	or a bad fit is what parents need to look out for.	3.9370368672567118
13898. one main type	of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper	front teeth.	5.353488447313329
13899. a chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the	face a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth an overdeveloped lower	jawbone and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type	of malocclusion.	3.3328883236045983
13900. these two basic malformations have of course	many variations.	6.787151725006055
13901. a child probably requires some form of treatment	if he has any of the following conditions:  a noticeable	protrusion of the upper or lower jaw.	3.8909629302496485
13902. crooked overlapping	twisted or widely spaced teeth.	6.182048259188013
13903. front teeth not meeting	when the back teeth close.	4.429547263880529
13904. upper teeth completely covering	the lowers when the back teeth close.	6.0040033053534785
13905. the eyeteeth	beginning	to protrude like fangs.	3.7179718297676136
13906. second teeth that have come in before	the first ones have fallen out making a double row.	5.954862664638592
13907. contrary	to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago when all malocclusion was	blamed on some unfortunate habit recent studies show that most tooth	irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition.	3.452025260662425
13908. however this does not mean that a child's teeth or jaws must	necessarily resemble those of someone in his family.	5.972728169459358
13909. tooth deformity	may be the result of excessive thumb- or finger-sucking tongue-thrusting	or lip-sucking- but it's important to remember that	there's a difference between normal and excessive sucking	habits.	3.3400795608431952
13910. it's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs and	no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two	or three years old.	4.674052651574961
13911. occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect	a youngster's teeth; but after that if thumb-sucking pressure	is frequent it will have an effect.	3.88359317315066
13912. malocclusion can also	result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long.	5.2905682872493625
13913. if a child	loses a molar at the age of two the adjoining teeth may shift toward	the empty space thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent	ones and producing a jumble.	3.4648175043455685
13914. if baby teeth are retained too long the	incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal	time or may have to erupt in the wrong place.	5.582806568485322
13915. every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by	their malformed teeth.	4.098559801581752
13916. some such youngsters rarely smile or they try	to speak with the mouth closed.	5.629194545318953
13917. in certain cases as in dick stewart's	a child's personality is affected.	3.9376884934159833
13918. yet from the dentist's	point of view bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons.	5.717926375119582
13919. bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through	a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots.	3.6061630537689124
13920. this serious	condition popularly known as pyorrhea is one of the chief causes	of tooth loss in adults.	5.986294503205498
13921. then too misplaced or jammed-together	teeth are prone to trapping food particles increasing the	likelihood of rapid decay.	3.5730903513678087
13922. for these and other reasons says dr	brodie orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth.	6.396898899629193
13923. the failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal	chewing so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden	on his digestive system.	3.3389479235537753
13924. because of these chewing troubles a child may	avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition.	5.839788522766992
13925. badly placed	teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping.	3.803809012916158
13926. how of straightening	most orthodontic work is done on children	between the ages of 10 and 14 though there have been patients	as young as two and as old as 55 says dr brodie.	5.572281893401881
13927. in	the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed	yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed	teeth comparatively easy.	3.313621021869122
13928. orthodontic work is possible because teeth	are held firmly but not rigidly by a system of peridontal membrane with	an involved nerve network to the bone in the jaw; they are not	anchored directly to the bone.	5.002572462425051
13929. abnormal pressure applied over a period	of time produces a change in the bony deposit so a tooth functions	normally in the new position into which it has been guided.	3.8538579162637276
13930. what	can 10-year-old susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's	office?	5.642299672414959
13931.  on her first visit the orthodontist will take x rays	photographs tooth measurements and tooth prints- an impression	of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws.	3.387145849664571
13932. if he decides to proceed he will custom-make for susie an appliance	consisting of bands plastic plates fine wires and tiny springs.	5.047711685480067
13933. this	appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure	on the bone.	3.678974380299685
13934. as the tooth moves bone cells on the pressure side	of it will dissolve and new ones will form on the side from which the	tooth has moved.	5.357232123784969
13935. this must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue	grows and no faster.	4.788587256509348
13936. if teeth are moved too rapidly serious	injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding	bone holding them in place explains dr brodie.	6.3340415114045205
13937. moving one	or two teeth can affect the whole system and an ill-conceived plan	of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face.	3.39425172578644
13938. during the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately	following each adjustment susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness	but after a short time this will disappear.	5.734926947992972
13939. parents are often	concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay.	4.038575658384135
13940. when	in place a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth	that is covered.	5.813362099503714
13941. next susie will enter the treatment stage	and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month depending on the severity	of her condition.	3.7545749283089656
13942. during these visits the dentist will adjust	the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth.	6.465425411246505
13943. last comes the	retention stage.	6.107327094811762
13944. susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable	new position.	6.0159411590210965
13945. but because teeth sometimes may drift back to	their original position a retaining appliance is used to lock them in	place.	3.6437557970874463
13946. usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and	stretching across the teeth.	6.28808300351126
13947. susie may wear this only at night or for	a few hours during the day.	3.8163090178652768
13948. then comes the time when the last	wire is removed and susie walks out a healthier and more attractive	girl than when she first went to the orthodontist.	5.5985720371228105
13949. how long	will this take?	5.994065224578856
13950.  straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may	take only a few months.	6.283251976974687
13951. aligning all the teeth may take a year or more.	4.524559535243964
13952. an added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three	years to correct.	5.937259826949477
13953. the charge for a	complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country.	4.042377871858585
13954. work	that might cost $500 to $750 in the south could cost $750 to $1200	in new york city or chicago.	5.624736017778482
13955. an average national figure for two	to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1000.	3.9634690687607983
13956. factors	in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill	and education of the practitioner says dr brodie.	5.942542915533556
13957. to	become an orthodontist a man must first be licensed by his state as	a dentist then he must spend at least two years in additional training	to acquire a license as a specialist.	3.5914985439795375
13958. costs may seem high	but they used to be even higher says dr brodie.	6.431420148142367
13959. fees	are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago.	4.606600625899819
13960. the	reason?	11.55875815210223
13961.  people today are aware of the value of orthodontics and	as a result there are more practitioners in the field.	4.4679131454771195
13962. most	orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic	materials and construction of the appliances but usually the remainder	of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years.	5.378596287530167
13963. in many	cities in the united states clinics associated with dental schools	will take patients at a nominal fee.	4.02568999679111
13964. some municipal agencies will	pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents.	5.755824562735927
13965. helps families	growth studies have been carried on consistently	by orthodontists.	4.009815159921993
13966. dr brodie has 30-year records of head growth	started 20 minutes after children's births.	5.82922571578098
13967. in the	past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was	scoffed at; now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth	formation to a large extent he says.	3.566186660765804
13968. fortunately through our	growth studies we have been able to see what nature does and that	helps us know what we can do.	6.427295887871013
13969. this knowledge both modifies	and dictates diagnosis and treatment.	4.162039218219114
13970. for example a boy may inherit	a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another.	5.794409895961832
13971. in the past	an orthodontist might have tried over four or five years to straighten	and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that despite some growth	would never accommodate them.	3.2430926739339383
13972. now a dentist can recommend extraction	immediately.	8.240520094105985
13973. in other cases in view of present-day knowledge	of head growth orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five	years before treatment.	3.928425873732789
13974. the child is kept on call and the orthodontist	watches the growth.	5.788032352019988
13975. nature often takes care of the problem	says dr brodie.	4.344388537818559
13976. a child with a certain type of head and teeth	will outgrow tooth deformity.	5.951898855308718
13977. that is why dr brodie	asks parents not to insist against their dentist's advice that their	child have orthodontic work done too early.	3.544748756456753
13978. both because of our	culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions	some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it	is wise to do so.	5.124668681190895
13979. let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start	treatment he urges.	4.458960143905173
13980. superior new material for orthodontic	work is another result of research.	5.762128258082218
13981. plastics are easier to handle	than the vulcanized rubber formerly used and they save time and money.	3.550004689151287
13982. plaster of paris once utilized in making impressions of teeth has	been replaced by alginates that work quickly	and accurately and with least discomfort to a child.	4.681010234768968
13983. best	as a rule the earlier general dental treatment is started	the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be.	3.574494108706668
13984. after your child's baby teeth are all in- usually at the age	of two and one half to three- it's time for that first dental appointment	dr brodie advises.	5.181437332236743
13985. then see that your youngster	has a routine checkup once a year.	4.161732733682109
13986. to help prevent orthodontic	problems from arising your dentist can do these things:	he can correct decay thus preventing early loss of teeth.	5.102079502566623
13987. if	a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay-	and if no preventive steps are taken- the other teeth may shift out	of position become overcrowded and malformed.	3.0947247996170035
13988. in turn the other teeth	are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them.	5.623192190004547
13989. from time to time the medium mentions other people around him	who were on the other side and reports what they are saying.	4.588987175036448
13990. after	a while there come initials and names and he is interested to hear	some rather unusual family nicknames.	5.541637862045159
13991. as the hour progresses the	sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific	statements.	4.002191554026695
13992. there are a few prognoses of coming events.	7.701366125251705
13993. another medium another sitter would produce a somewhat different	content but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing	reading.	3.8441494044484954
13994. some mediums speak in practical down-to-earth terms while	others may stress the spiritual.	5.457189211964983
13995. not all as a matter of fact consider	themselves mediums in the sense of receiving messages from	the deceased.	4.732397646654798
13996. in fact some sensitives rule this out preferring to	consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception		on this side of the veil.	5.478796109050597
13997. however that may be people are	known to go to mediums for diverse reasons.	4.79941774191638
13998. perhaps they are mourning	a recent death and want comfort to feel in touch with the deceased	or seek indications for future plans.	5.369103732568844
13999. they may of course be curiosity	seekers- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship.	4.353475968381438
14000. the mediums with whom the parapsychology foundation	is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated	state so that the sitter can make comments ask and answer questions	instead of talking with a control who speaks through an	entranced sensitive.	4.687363063580844
14001. what we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary	conversation.	5.023118786748749
14002. but it is not really only a conversation.	9.740887765541846
14003. many a sitter has been amazed to realize that	the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind.	3.7733805911348988
14004. he himself	might not have been really aware of his own mood; it had been latent	unspecified semi-conscious and only partly realized- until she	described it to him! most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability	to put a finger on pre-conscious moods and to clarify them.	4.816274747667927
14005. however in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium	he did not receive a personal reading.	4.535585493696978
14006. instead he brought with	him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium	knew nothing.	6.257059335958805
14007. for this was to be a proxy sitting.	6.758779029508238
14008. as	was noted earlier it is important that in valid objective study of	this sort of communication the interested sitter should be separated	from the sensitive.	5.095286635560148
14009. dr karlis osis director of research at	the parapsychology foundation described the basis for the experiment	in a tomorrow article	.	3.799883857480955
14010. he remarked: it has been clearly established	that in a number of instances the message did not come from a	spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter.	5.569807755530889
14011. the possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's esp	may tap the memory of the sitter and to do this the two central	characters in this drama must be separated.	3.793986606791127
14012. one way to do	this is by proxy sittings wherein the person seeking a message	does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute	the proxy sitter.	5.030170839578631
14013. if the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter	except his name he cannot possibly	give any clues conscious or unconscious far less ask leading questions.	3.3428476535743563
14014. all he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner seeking	to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal	impressions.	6.014085893834841
14015. sometimes in these experiments appointment	sittings are used.	4.838465295888417
14016. here the absent sitter makes a date	with a communicator asking him	to come in at a certain hour when a channel will be open for	him.	5.71884390139958
14017. in this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator	nothing else.	4.50818619508045
14018. he gives this to the medium at the appointed	time and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages	from the communicator.	5.52302361986221
14019. as always a tape recording or detailed	notes are made and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter.	4.052159058454999
14020. so this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier	between the medium's esp and the absent sitter's mind.	5.460492363148317
14021. it	is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements- though	research still does not know how far afield esp can range.	3.7913043546828735
14022. now the original absent sitter must decide whether the	statements are meaningful to him.	6.065161779996401
14023. here again laboratory approaches	are being evolved for it is recognized how elastic these readings	can be how they can apply to many people and are often stated	in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case.	3.478791828347538
14024. if you look at a reading meant for someone else you will probably	see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you	even when you were not in the picture at all! an interested sitter	may think the sensitive has made a hit describing something accurately	for him but can he really be sure that another sitter hearing	the same statement would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances?	5.252016371023453
14025. 	it is of course easy to see how j will mean	uncle jack to one person and little jane to another.	3.719076522926301
14026. a journey	a	little white house a change of outlook can apply to many	people.	5.942185625592951
14027. and even more complex items can be interpreted to conform	to one's own point of view which is by nature so personal.	3.907950121934552
14028. one sitter	may think a leather couch identifies a reading as surely directed	to him; to another it seems that nobody but his father ever	used the phrase atta boy!   to get around this quite difficult	corner there is one first aid to objectiveness: prevent the	distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him.	4.679765924698357
14029. if he is	not told which of four or five readings was meant for him he can more	readily assess each item in a larger frame: does that statement	really sound as if it were for me significant in my particular life?	3.5828838854145113
14030. 	or am i taking something that could really apply to almost anybody	and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar	experience?	4.978231890672655
14031.    conversely experimenters would consider as impressive	such statements as the following which if they turned out	to be hits are so unusual as to be really significant:   he	had four children two sets of twins.	3.3031090875516584
14032. after being a lawyer for twenty-five	years he started studying for the ministry.	6.284809357681613
14033. part of his house	had been moved to the other side of the road.	5.573712828293759
14034. he died of typhoid in	1921.	7.384439816260446
14035. methods have been developed of assigning weights	to statements; that is it is known empirically that names beginning	with r are more common than those beginning with z; that	fewer women are named miranda than elizabeth; that in the united	states more people die of heart disease than of smallpox.	3.2162315088829567
14036. so each reading	can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these	weights.	5.965612916663961
14037. specific dates would be important as would double names.	4.377812609994432
14038. various categories have been explored to find out about these empirical	probabilities against which to measure the readings.	6.218432243371602
14039. in	the parapsychology foundation's long-range experiment readings	are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating	sitters trying to throw light on this question of the significance	of mediumistic statements.	3.8232674329944727
14040. it is very important indeed in the field	of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis	to know whether the statements are actually only those which any	intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself.	5.016894107592663
14041. or on the other hand are unlikely facts being stated facts which are	in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody?	3.8609402514048097
14042. 	that is one thing the experiments are designed to find out.	6.629757845953552
14043. so after the sitting has been held several readings at one time	are mailed and the distant sitter	must mark each little item as correct	incorrect doubtful or especially significant	.	3.3173733605349947
14044. he is required to	mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his.	5.996387384151102
14045. all these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated by adding	up the hits and significants with the weight placed on those in the	sitter's own reading.	3.4274125811507696
14046. that is if he marks as most correct a reading	not meant for him the total experimental score falls.	5.9992800365718635
14047. conversely	if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading and finds more	accurate facts in it than in the others a point is chalked up for	the intrinsic objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material.	3.49120366236442
14048. and there are some positive results though the final findings	will not be known for a long time- and then further research can	be formulated.	6.088669564669263
14049. in another approach to the same procedure the	content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium	is likely to slant her statements.	3.934875937157447
14050. does she often speak of locations	of cause of death?	6.8173099720416355
14051.  does she accurately give dates ages kind	of occupation?	4.627965921858336
14052.  it is possible to find out in which categories most	of her correct statements fall and where she makes most of her hits.	6.042528478065737
14053. now when so to speak the cream has been skimmed off and the	items in the successful categories separated out the sitter can be asked	to consider and rate only this concentrated cream where the	sensitive is at her best.	3.262647855909557
14054. mediumistic impressions are evidently	of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses.	5.361534078825234
14055. i feel cold	the medium says or my leg aches my head is heavy.	3.8342814015869564
14056. or perhaps she hears words or sounds: there's such a noise	of loud machinery or i hear a child crying or he says	we're all here and glad to see you.	4.774169893632099
14057. maybe an entire scene comes	into consciousness with action and motion or a static view: a	house under a pine tree with a little stone path going up to the door.	3.5404001160833105
14058. the sensitive often seems to smell definite odors too or subjectively	feels emotions.	4.870524295994905
14059. sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery	and seems to see all details in perspective as if the scene were actually	there.	3.72535576034148
14060. if pressed by the sitter for more detail she may be able	to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply almost	as if she were physically going closer.	5.130828893535877
14061. if asked how she gets	her impressions she probably can only say that she just gets them-	some more vividly than others.	3.438194672239205
14062. perhaps this is not so extraordinary	after all.	10.25840118711114
14063. even in normal experience one gets impressions without	knowing exactly how- of atmosphere of one another's personalities	moods intentions.	3.733770718929486
14064. of course there is an element of training	here: these gifted people by concentration study guidance	have	learned to develop their power.	6.01478490542106
14065. simply using it increases its intensity	i was told by one sensitive.	3.995205509513743
14066. nor does a medium automatically	know how to interpret her imagery.	6.440592451233234
14067. impressions often appear in	a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value.	3.8205217443105877
14068. it is apparently	by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious and the medium	has to translate these into meaning.	5.261942226967525
14069. if communication with an entity	on the other side is taking place this too may assume the form	of clairvoyant symbolism.	3.9358343529643784
14070. during one reading an image appeared	of a prisoner in irons.	6.575857664901681
14071. but this did not necessarily refer to an	actual jail; taken with other details it could have referred to a state	of mental or spiritual confinement.	3.7190870714116206
14072. in this connection it is worth	noting how names are sometimes obtained.	6.346763706438573
14073. though they are often heard	clairaudiently as if a voice were speaking them in other cases they	are apprehended visually as symbols: a slope to signify the name	hill for instance.	3.4345187528025463
14074. one medium saw two sheets flapping on a line	and found that the name shietz was significant to the sitter.	5.488345700968874
14075. the farmer's life must be arranged	to meet the demands of crops and livestock.	3.4667907663099045
14076. livestock must be	tended every day routinely.	6.583634035554475
14077. a slight change in the work schedule may	cut the production of cows or chickens.	4.344091700383013
14078. even if there are no	livestock the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods particularly	during the growing season.	6.269068149584813
14079. the worker who lives on a farm	cannot change jobs readily.	3.5628155042479404
14080. he cannot leave the farm to take work	in another locality on short notice; such a move may mean a loss of	capital.	5.47865600421982
14081. hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part	of farm life.	3.8096345174974977
14082. the farmer must get up early and at times work late	at night.	5.636184717983663
14083. frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold	rain.	4.019520031040406
14084. no matter how well work is planned bad weather or unexpected	setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up.	5.4567945341196005
14085. it may	not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery	that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably.	3.408972292350948
14086. production	may fall far below expectations.	6.923066648141632
14087. drought hail disease and insects	take their toll of crops.	3.9009782425049617
14088. sickness or loss of some of the livestock	may cut into the owner's earnings even into his capital.	5.743879894537547
14089. returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good	year.	3.93648194947524
14090. the high cost of land supplies and labor make it difficult	to farm profitably on a part-time basis.	5.175038921210792
14091. land within commuting	distance of a growing city is usually high in price higher if it has	subdivision possibilities.	3.4960845545934274
14092. part-time farmers generally must pay higher	prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller	quantities.	4.868947677392683
14093. if the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high	farm labor costs will also be high.	4.107571373722107
14094. a part-time farmer needs	unusual skill to get as high production per hen per cow or per acre	as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer.	4.918610198584023
14095. it will frequently	be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment.	4.689608326957432
14096. he	may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations	such as spraying or threshing and for these he may have to wait his	turn.	5.667064309896089
14097. there will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he	is away at his off-farm job.	3.9794776686449964
14098. the farm may be an additional	burden if the main job is lost.	5.721072937404207
14099. this may be true whether the farm is	owned or rented.	4.539000869116256
14100. if the farm is rented the rent must be paid.	6.663860877697424

14109. generally the s	ame level of living costs less in the country than	in the city.	4.480726002471915
14110. the savings are not as great however as is sometime supposed.	5.649374101333722
14111. usually the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on	the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more.	4.227051475056589

14114. some persons consider the	work on a farm recreational.	6.979249989199218
14115. for some white-collar workers it is a	welcome change from the regular job and a physical conditioner.	4.026891893672296
14116. labor and equipment needed	part-time farming can take comparatively	little land labor and equipment- or a great deal.	5.915116374842018
14117. it depends	on the kind and the scale of the farming operation.	4.7243142880212154
14118. general	requirements for land labor and equipment are discussed below.	6.182413582636834
14119. specific	requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed	on pages 8 to 14.	3.8256906647648603
14120. three quarters to 1 acre of good land	is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use and for a	small flock of chickens a cow and two pigs.	5.073380946202398
14121. you could not of course	raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small.	4.142269877386077
14122. if you	want to	raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale you'll	need more land.	5.4215490870465475
14123. in deciding how much land you want take into	account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect.	3.7916772873164626
14124. but	consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your	other work.	5.9753236449261085
14125. the cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in	value may influence your decision.	3.9330217611077782
14126. some part-time farmers buy more	land than they need in anticipation of suburban development.	5.652858034359663
14127. this is	a highly speculative venture.	5.028080467761562
14128. sometimes a desired acreage is offered	only as part of a larger tract.	6.9100389849812025
14129. when surplus land is not expensive	to buy or to keep up it is usually better to buy it than to buy	so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might	impair the residential value of the farm.	3.732315771239389
14130. if you have a	year-round full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your	family uses- unless other members of the family do a good deal of	the work or you hire help.	6.045090148258489
14131. as a rule part-time farmers hire little	help.	5.328333343473232
14132. in deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor	compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with	the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1.	5.487707173017181
14133. list	the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month.	4.755832679688987
14134. you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have	one.	6.491161419645429
14135. do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare	time- only what you are willing to use for farm work.	4.065330300362074
14136. if you are going to produce for home use only you will need only	hand tools.	7.145724647808964
14137. you will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing	however.	4.819301547896829
14138. for larger plantings you'll need some kind of power	for plowing harrowing disking and cultivating.	5.489081120496486
14139. if you have a planting	of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor	.	4.260754377682746
14140. these	tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing particularly on heavier	soils so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing.	5.083103675199248
14141. cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the	small-scale farmer.	4.351983522587257
14142. if you are going to farm for extra cash income on	a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments	when you choose among farm enterprises.	5.366258856899761
14143. you can keep your	machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery by sharing	the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor and by hiring	someone with machinery to do certain jobs.	3.280405774928817
14144. if an expensive and specialized	piece of machinery is needed- such as a spray rig a combine	or a binder- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work.	5.43677825912476
14145. before you look for a farm you'll need	to know the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake; and	whether you want to buy or rent.	4.2247978465100795
14146. information on pages 8 to 14	may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture.	5.55285652517693
14147. if you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish	to locate or if you are not sure that you and your family will like	and make a success of farming usually you would do better to rent	a place for a year or two before you buy.	4.157228709515174
14148. discussed below are	some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm.	6.067007831904567
14149. choose a location within easy	commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities.	3.8098993060599784
14150. then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell	the farm.	6.020199357072818
14151. the presence of alternative job opportunities also will	make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable.	3.4085841801816246
14152. nearness to	if you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby.	5.823376450329175
14153. if you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk for example	you should be close to a town or city.	3.8115025329344903
14154. look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes.	7.441572646139716
14155. there are slums	in the country as well as in the city.	5.759191433366432
14156. few rural areas are protected	by zoning.	7.333703736862965
14157. a tavern filling station junk yard rendering plant	or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to	hurt its value.	3.0994552548930425
14158. check on the schools	in the area the quality of teaching and the provision for transportation	to and from them.	5.988441155229493
14159. find out whether fire protection sewage	system gas water mains and electrical lines are available in the	locality.	3.6362122518884994
14160. if these facilities are not at the door getting them may	cost more than you expect.	6.54763242597078
14161. you may have to provide them yourself or	get along without them.	4.87446102061581
14162. you cannot get along without an adequate	supply of pure water.	7.1090307900963765
14163. if you are considering a part-time farm where	the water must be provided by a well find out if there is a good well	on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled.	3.7947973921275877
14164. a pond may	provide adequate water for livestock and garden.	5.673342578345905
14165. pond water can be filtered	for human use but most part-time farmers would not want to go	to so much trouble.	3.4738677585899915
14166. the following amounts of water are needed per day	for livestock and domestic uses.	5.380951397016672
14167. is the land	suited to the crops you intend to raise?	4.717233512374254
14168.  if you can't tell get	help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist.	5.670885847043006
14169. soil type drainage or degree of slope can make the difference between	good crops and poor ones.	3.647617702650923
14170. small areas that aren't right for a certain	the	will the house on any part-time farm you are considering	make a satisfactory full-time residence?	5.165488006894391
14171.  how much will it cost to	do any necessary modernizing and redecorating?	4.282644346044353
14172.  if the house is not	wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating	system must be installed check into the cost of making these improvements.	5.590718347043879
14173. the value of the farm to you will depend	on-  the value of	the products you can raise on it.	3.875551660389878
14174. the possibilities of selling	the property later on for suburban subdivision.	5.2440891580228755
14175. decide first	what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison	with what it would cost to live in town.	4.301183898733336
14176. take into account the difference	in city and county taxes insurance rates utility rates and	the cost of travel to work.	5.418543614152144
14177. next estimate the value of possible	earnings of the farm.	5.200477677728609
14178. to do this set up a plan on paper for operating	the farm.	7.457454400632626
14179. list the kind and quantity of things the farm can be	expected to produce in an average year.	3.8825563877946143
14180. estimate the value of the produce	at normal prices.	7.297296798336649
14181. the total is the probable gross income from farming.	3.9025275400544284
14182. to find estimated net farm income subtract estimated	annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming.	5.542171142306126
14183. include	as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings	and equipment.	3.689924685640195
14184. also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be	contributed by the family.	5.922930054882537
14185. it may be hard to decide what this labor	is worth but charge something for it.	4.28282184385825
14186. otherwise you may pay too much	for the farm and get nothing for your labor.	5.844362730197227
14187. to figure the	value of the farm in terms of investment income divide the estimated	annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get	in interest if the money were invested in some other way.	3.6224356018401718
14188. everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his	day in court as in some vast collective dirge.	6.028546532567934
14189. for almost two months	the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the	grave about fathers and mothers graybeards adolescents babies starved	beaten to death strangled machine-gunned gassed burned.	3.25228755677772
14190. one	who had been a boy in auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected	by height for the gas chambers.	5.716441619454431
14191. the gruesome humor of the nazis	was not forgotten- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name	of a jewish foundation and bearing a copper star of david- nor	the gratuitous sadism of ss officers.	2.8688326804829054
14192. public relations strategists	everywhere watching the reaction of the german press the liberal	press the lunatic-fringe press listening to their neighbors studying	interviews with men and women on the street cried out: too much	too much- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled the horrors	are losing their effect.	5.132335954702703
14193. and still another witness one who had crawled	out from under a heap of corpses had to tell how the victims had	been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before	being shot.	3.5274709370685287
14194. h   most of this testimony may have been legally	admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total nazi	crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it	of the defendant's department of jewish affairs.	5.280328447150923
14195. counsel for the	defense however shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current	of dreadful recollections rarely raised an objection.	3.292197859189703
14196. would not the	emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming	if not exhausting effect likely to improve his client's chances?	5.2815405191407665
14197. 	those who feared emotionalism at the trial showed less	understanding than dr servatius of the route by which man achieves	the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies.	3.158306658384062
14198. interruptions	came	largely from the bench which numerous times rebuked the attorney	general for letting his witnesses run on though it too made no serious	effort to choke off the flow.	4.7735796949999045
14199. but there was a contrast even	more decisive than a hunger for fact between the trial in jerusalem	and those in moscow and new york.	3.899005854585448
14200. in each of the last the trial	marked the beginning of a new course: in moscow the liquidation	of the old bolsheviks and the tightening of stalin's dictatorship;	in the united states the initiation of militant anti-communism	with the repentant ex-communist in the vanguard.	5.6526601927188524
14201. these trials were	properly termed political cases in that the trial itself was	a political act producing political consequences.	3.592363208608907
14202. but what could the	eichmann trial initiate?	7.99263828464834
14203.  of what new course could it mark the beginning?	4.768714084418931
14204. 	the eichmann case looked to the past not to the future.	6.25730363209245
14205. it was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection	and of refining the recollection that will last as long as there	are jews.	4.15374178903101
14206. as such it was beyond politics and had no need of justification	by a message.	6.33787609097026
14207. it is not an individual	that is in the dock at this historical trial- said ben gurion	and not the nazi regime alone- but anti-semitism throughout	history.	3.773362267488147
14208. how could supplying eichmann with a platform on which to	maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of jews	without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-semitism?	5.373755112366168
14209. 	and if it was not an individual who was in the dock why	was the trial as we shall observe later all but scuttled in the	attempt to prove eichmann a fiend?	3.8129353014766307
14210.  these questions touch the	root of confusion in the prosecution's case.	6.165508931986591
14211. it might be contended	of course that eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-semitic	feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-semitism.	3.586577397096804
14212. but in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined	by ben gurion and set forth in the indictment.	6.419641801064868
14213. in such a case	the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied	to the issue by argument.	4.388578966411422
14214. one who could be linked to anti-semitism	only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the	jew-baiter throughout the ages.	5.354857823851347
14215. shout at eichmann though he might	the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying	the way he felt about jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally	recognized category of anti-semitism.	3.263715062837308
14216. yes he believed that the	jews were enemies of the reich and such a belief is of course	typical of patriotic anti-semites; but he believed in the	jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract theological way like a member	of a cult speculating on the nature of things.	5.195174797026636
14217. the real question was	how one passed from anti-semitism of this sort to murder and the answer	to this question is not to be found in anti-semitism itself.	3.7652604301314483
14218. in	regard to eichmann	it was to be found in the nazi outlook which contained	a principle separate from and far worse than anti-semitism a	principle by which the poison of anti-semitism itself was made more virulent.	5.210380798889802
14219. perhaps under the guidance of this nazi principle one could	as eichmann declared feel personally friendly toward the	jews and still be their murderer.	3.534022367722105
14220. not through fear of disobeying orders	as eichmann kept trying to explain but through a peculiar giddiness	that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained	in the nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of hitler's	victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical	rightness that was able to respond to any proposal and the more outrageous	the better well let's try it.	4.630206944528728
14221. at any rate the substance	of eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from	his membership in the party and the ss and though the prosecutor	did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of jews his success	on this score was doubtful and the anti-semitic lesson weakened to	that extent.	3.1633647701538967
14222. but if the trial did not expose the special	nazi mania so deadly to jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened	to light neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary	anti-semitism of which the nazis made such effective use in germany	and wherever else they could find it.	4.991362273625489
14223. if anti-semitism was on trial	in jerusalem why was it not identified and with enough emphasis	to capture the notice of the world press in its connection with the	activities of eichmann's department of jewish affairs as exemplified	by the betrayal and murder of jews by non-police and non-party anti-semites	in germany as well as in poland czechoslovakia hungary?	3.3154113207108478
14224. 	the infamous wansee conference called by heydrich in january	1942 to organize the material and technical means to put to death	the eleven million jews spread throughout the nations of europe was	attended by representatives of major organs of the german state including	the reich minister of the interior the state secretary in	charge of the four year plan the reich minister of justice the	under secretary of foreign affairs.	4.711996810140055
14225. the measures for annihilation	proposed and accepted at the conference affected industry transportation	civilian agencies of government.	3.2490496444171737
14226. heydrich in opening the conference	followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order	issued earlier by goering which authorized the final solution as	a complement to previous solutions for eliminating the jews	from german living space through violence economic strangulation	forced emigration and evacuation.	4.334284042397863
14227. in other words the promulgators	of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the jews	was but an extension of the anti-semitic measures already operating	in every phase of german life and that the new conspiracy counted on	the general anti-semitism that had made those measures effective as	a readiness for murder.	3.3256994441027463
14228. this in fact it turned out to be.	9.136074536839415
14229. since	the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible once the wheels had	began to turn persons controlling german industries social institutions	and armed forces became through their anti-semitism or their	tolerance of it conscious accomplices of hitler's crimes; whether	in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually.	3.0366079525713814
14230. what more could be asked for a trial intended to warn	the world against anti-semitism than this opportunity to expose the	exact link between the respectable anti-semite and the concentration-camp	brute?	5.004158627155272
14231.  not in eichmann's anti-semitism but in the anti-semitism	of the sober german man of affairs lay the potential warning	of the trial.	3.7429397746131032
14232. no doubt many of the citizens of the third reich had	conceived their anti-semitism as an innocent dislike of jews	as do others like them today.	6.080973767649457
14233. the final solution proved that the	jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the	criminality and madness of others.	3.159138274184799
14234. ought not an edifying trial have	made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how	representative types of mere anti-semites were drawn step by	step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings?	4.764076085711229
14235.  the prosecutor	in his opening remarks did refer to the germ of anti-semitism	among the germans which hitler stimulated and transformed.	3.0504399986725286
14236. but	if there was evidence at the trial that aimed over eichmann's	head	at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned the press	seems to have missed it.	4.946910914599485
14237. nor did the trial devote much	attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-semitism to the nazis	both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations	and states.	3.351365124026761
14238. certainly one of the best ways of warning the	world against anti-semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous	weapon.	6.286549973419566
14239. eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-jew	can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society	into a menace to all his neighbors.	3.6725285574239295
14240. do patriots everywhere know	enough about how the persecution of the jews in germany and later in	the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations splitting	apart individuals and groups arousing the meanest and most dishonest	impulses pulverizing trust and personal dignity and finally	forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them	partners in unspeakable crimes?	4.399169203779823
14241.  the career of eichmann made the trial	a potential showcase for anti-semitic demoralization: fearful	of being mistaken for a jew he seeks protection in his nazi uniform;	clinging to the enemy-jew idea he is forced to overcome habits of	politeness and neighborliness; once in power he begins to give vent	to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania	and envy of those above him.	2.816946090967213
14242. is this the type of citizen you	desire?	9.375364009157545
14243.  the trial should have asked the nations.	4.278404157187238
14244. but though this	characterization in no way diminished eichmann's guilt the prosecutor	more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a	political one would have none of it.	5.145990052334916
14245. finally if the mission	of the trial was to convict anti-semitism how could it have failed	to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which	the final solution was aided by native jew-haters- ie	germany poland hungary czechoslovakia- and those in which it	met the obstacle of human solidarity- denmark holland italy bulgaria	france?	3.1096709588402875
14246.  should not everyone have been awakened to it as an	outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-semitism	proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose	citizens saved their jewish compatriots from the transports?	5.297478364882676
14247.  wasn't	this meaning of eichmann's experience in various countries	worth highlighting?	3.9401948011062786
14248. 	as the first collective confrontation	of the nazi outrage the trial of eichmann represents a recovery	of the jews from the shock of the death camps a recovery that took fifteen	years and which is still by no means complete	.	4.822576328483345
14249. only across a distance	of time could the epic accounting begin.	4.226426345078315
14250. it is already difficult to	recall how little we knew before the trial of what had been done to	the jews of europe.	5.905709968385286
14251. it is not that the facts of the persecution were	unavailable; most of the information elicited in jerusalem had	been brought to the surface by the numerous war crimes tribunals and	investigating commissions and by reports memoirs and survivors'	accounts.	3.6019482355945915
14252. in poughkeepsie n y in 1952 a roman catholic hospital	presented seven protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the	planned parenthood federation or to resign from the hospital staff.	4.830277591218058
14253. three agreed but four declined and were suspended.	4.54633544159594
14254. after a flood of	protests they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953.	6.986237191534893
14255. the peace	of the community	was badly disturbed and people across the nation reading of the	incident felt uneasy.	3.2110241642911794
14256. in new york city in 1958 the city's	commissioner of hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide	a protestant mother with a contraceptive device.	5.724668671021766
14257. he thereby precipitated	a bitter controversy involving protestants jews and roman	catholics that continued for two months until the city's board	of hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy.	3.0735367303538523
14258. a year	later in albany n y a roman catholic hospital barred an	orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the planned parenthood	association.	5.329961453357197
14259. immediately the religious groups of the city were	embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's	right to freedom of religious belief and conscience.	3.6471414786962133
14260. these incidents	typical of many others dramatize the distressing fact that no	controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension	rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control	issue.	5.1747369728452135
14261. it has flared up periodically on the front pages of	newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in	municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies.	3.4604376739910983
14262. it has erupted	on the national level in the matter of including birth-control	information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries.	6.0824542514255455
14263. where	it is not actually erupting it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment	like a volcano ready to explode at any moment.	3.1896730787900833
14264. the	time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove	this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life	of our nation.	5.16532186700014
14265. the first step toward the goal is the establishment	of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication	on other than the polemical level.	3.9133312640420472
14266. instead of emotional recrimination	loaded phrases and sloganeering we need a dispassionate study	of the facts a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more	serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is	reached.	5.182690337670345
14267. all too frequently points out james o'gara	managing editor of commonweal catholics run roughshod over	protestant sensibilities in this matter by failure to consider the	reasoning behind the protestant position and particularly by their	jibes at the fact that protestant opinion on birth control has changed	in recent decades.	3.297340011809469
14268. all too often our language is unduly	harsh.	7.702104135130169
14269. the second step is to recognize the substantial agreement-	frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting-	already existing between catholics and non-catholics concerning the	over-all objectives of family planning.	3.0597450534948765
14270. instead of catholics' being	obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number	of offspring as many non-catholics imagine the ideal of responsible	parenthood is stressed.	5.108871407363578
14271. family planning is encouraged so that parents	will be able to provide properly for their offspring.	4.27931716393588
14272. pope	pius 12 declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from	the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the	whole duration of married life if there are serious reasons such as	those often mentioned in the so-called medical eugenic economic and	social indications.	5.269584227824525
14273. this means that such factors as the health	of the parents particularly the mother their ability to provide their	children with the necessities of life the degree of population density	of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately	be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring.	3.6269564604490374
14274. these are substantially the same factors considered by non-catholics	in family planning.	6.4451693304314945
14275. the laws of many states permit birth control	only for medical reasons.	3.636656897412452
14276. the roman catholic church however	sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning.	5.581108687415219
14277. catholics	protestants and jews are in agreement over the objectives of	family planning but disagree over the methods to be used.	3.6446738328948722
14278. the roman	catholic church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method also	known as the use of the infertile or safe period.	5.047822882244398
14279. the church considers	this to be the method provided by nature and its divine author:	it involves no frustration of nature's laws but simply an intelligent	and disciplined use of them.	3.3025861670326355
14280. with the exception of the roman	catholic and the orthodox catholic churches most churches make no	moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives	allowing the couple free choice.	5.021687094200708
14281. here is a difference in	theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement.	4.55290705359952
14282. the	grounds for the church's position are scriptural	the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early church the	unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries the decisions of the highest	ecclesiastical authority and the natural law.	4.967206075051078
14283. the latter plays a prominent	role in roman catholic theology and is considered decisive	entirely apart from scripture in determining the ethical character of	birth-prevention methods.	3.250235401117977
14284. the roman catholic natural-law tradition	regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of	the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual	love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end.	4.67939049204753
14285. this conclusion	is based on two propositions: that man by the use of his reason	can ascertain god's purpose in the universe and that god makes known	his purpose by certain given physical arrangements.	3.393769272601463
14286. thus	man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal	act is procreation the propagation of the race.	5.539170719020395
14287. moreover man	may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by	god who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for	the control of conception.	3.452749915429275
14288. believing that god is the author of this	law and of all laws of nature roman catholics believe that they are	obliged to obey those laws not frustrate or mock them.	4.870491157243137
14289. let	it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between	protestants and roman catholics appear to be irreconcilable.	3.668889128489915
14290. but	people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines without	taking up arms against those who disagree with them.	4.860399867530004
14291. why is it	so different in regard to birth control?	4.9345857426492366
14292.  it is because each side has	sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation	and thus indirectly force its belief or at least the practical	consequences thereof upon others.	5.263987771186835
14293. it is always a temptation	for a religious organization especially a powerful or dominant	one to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint	upon others.	3.530414004779419
14294. both roman catholics and protestants have succumbed	to this temptation in the past.	5.841065892767064
14295. consider what happened during	world war 1 when the protestant churches united to push the	prohibition law through congress.	3.9354549176629745
14296. many of them sincerely believe	that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically	evil and sinful.	6.506453180486159
14297. with over four million american men away at war protestants	forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general	public.	3.7819824414752783
14298. with the return of our soldiers it soon became apparent that	the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens.	6.1909275249869395
14299. the attempt	to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers racketeers	hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled	in our history.	3.2954541073478407
14300. the so-called noble experiment came to an	inglorious end.	5.1158434105704504
14301. that tumultuous painful and costly experience	shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced	when it has little correspondence with the general view of society.	3.390038055271429
14302. that experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control	today.	6.803216500908018
14303. up to the turn of the century contraception was condemned	by all christian churches as immoral unnatural and contrary	to divine law.	3.983768513449152
14304. this was generally reflected in the civil laws of christian	countries.	7.614005670345803
14305. today the roman catholic and orthodox churches	stand virtually alone in holding that conviction.	4.27772492301348
14306. the various lambeth	conferences expressing the anglican viewpoint mirror the gradual	change that has taken place among protestants generally.	4.927819553072047
14307. in 1920 the lambeth conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception	and issued an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural	means for the avoidance of conception together with the grave dangers-	physical moral and religious- thereby incurred and against	the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race.	3.1119840870514954
14308. denouncing	the view that the sexual union is an end in itself the conference	declared: we steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded	as the governing considerations of christian marriage.	5.04718322035363
14309. one is the	primary purpose for which marriage exists namely the continuance	of the race through the gift and heritage of children; the other is	the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful	self-control.	3.243206242693669
14310. the conference called for a vigorous campaign against	the open or secret sale of contraceptives.	5.194647642554535
14311. in 1930 the lambeth	conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be	the procreation of children but conceded that in certain limited circumstances	contraception might be morally legitimate.	3.2915458468780487
14312. in 1958	the conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by	god on parents everywhere.	5.508085301746917
14313. many other protestant denominations	preceded the anglicans in such action.	4.36097330843692
14314. in march 1931 22 out	of 28 members of a committee of the federal council of churches ratified	artificial methods of birth control.	5.760418790937779
14315. as to the necessity	the committee declared for some form of effective control of the	size of the family and the spacing of children and consequently of control	of conception there can be no question h.	4.015291351590871
14316. there is general agreement	also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression	of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right.	5.031543278925071
14317. since then many protestant denominations have made separate	pronouncements in which they not only approved birth control but declared	it at times to be a religious duty.	4.1936402883726425
14318. what determines the morality	they state is not the means used but the motive.	6.955241351004508
14319. in	general the means that prove most effective are	considered the most ethical.	4.001387324540611
14320. this development is reflected in	the action taken in february 1961 by the general board of the	national	council of churches the largest protestant organization in the	us.	5.057149034283576
14321. the board approved and commended the use of birth-control	devices as a part of christian responsibility in family planning.	4.097066307743104
14322. it	called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting	the information or availability of contraceptives.	5.128642350810707
14323. the general	board declared: most of the protestant churches hold contraception	and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are	right h.	3.400459317972529
14324. the general protestant conviction is that motives rather	than methods form the primary moral issue provided the methods are	limited to the prevention of conception.	5.098396702229052
14325. an action once universally	condemned by all christian churches and forbidden by the civil	law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of protestant	denominations but also deemed at certain times to be a positive	religious duty.	3.492473186327238
14326. this viewpoint has now been translated into	action by the majority of people in this country.	6.094543108237827
14327. repeated polls have	disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the	practice of birth control.	3.449047851664086
14328. for all concerned with social-welfare	legislation the significance of this radical and revolutionary	change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the american	people is clear profound and far-reaching.	5.441858715358382
14329. to try to oppose the general	religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative	fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was	occasioned by the ill-starred prohibition experiment.	3.8375341983431444
14330. this brings	us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in	the field of civil legislation but in the realm of conscience and religion:	they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief.	5.42065308826316
14331. conscience and religion are concerned with private sin: the civil	law is concerned with public crimes.	3.8616714131881515
14332. only confusion failure	and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority	the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the	possibility of sin.	5.118699857954863
14333. among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived	imposition would be religion itself.	4.629140574765654
14334. on april 17 1610 the sturdy little three-masted bark discovery	weighed anchor in st katherine's pool london and	floated down the thames toward the sea.	5.010061457794579
14335. she carried besides her captain	a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration	of the arctic waters of north america.	3.3492648187801533
14336. seventeen months later	on september 6 1611 an irish fishing boat sighted the discovery	limping eastward outside galway bay.	4.815613562704366
14337. when she reached port	she was found to have on board only eight men all near starvation.	3.9792941564376045
14338. the	captain was gone and the mate was gone.	6.204819404419939
14339. the man who now commanded	her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman.	4.433938866586924
14340. what disaster	struck the discovery during those seventeen months?	6.675512239975092
14341.  what happened	to the fourteen missing men?	5.342298497407447
14342.  these questions have remained	one of the great sea mysteries of all time.	6.805321656478652
14343. for hundreds of years the	evidence available consisted of the captain's fragmentary journal	a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors a note	found in a dead man's desk on board and several second-hand	reports.	3.4321580070381446
14344. all told they offered a highly confused picture.	7.0078242786891325
14345. but	since 1927 researchers digging into ancient court records and legal	files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information.	3.7335162707209104
14346. not	enough to do away with all doubts but sufficient to give a fairly accurate	picture of the events of the voyage.	5.869429207367749
14347. historians have had	two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations.	4.017967921585419
14348. first	they wanted to clarify a tantalizing bizarre enigma.	5.878691232633974
14349. second they believed	it important to determine the fate of the captain- a man whose	name is permanently stamped on our maps on american towns and counties	on a great american river and on half a million square miles	of arctic seas.	3.2767485018853884
14350. this	is the story of his last tragic voyage as nearly as we are able- or	ever probably will be able- to determine:   the sailing in	the spring of 1610 was hudson's fourth in four years.	5.183291787314993
14351. each time	his objective had been the same- a direct water passage from western	europe to the far east.	3.939572146397399
14352. in 1607 and 1608 the english muscovy	company had sent him northward to look for a route over the north pole	or across the top of russia.	5.600642776000847
14353. twice he had failed and the muscovy	company indicated it would not back him again.	4.6584534998174805
14354. in 1609 the	dutch east india company hired hudson gave him two learned geographers	fitted him out with a ship called the half moon and supplied	him with dutch sailors.	4.9999750294602645
14355. this time he turned westward to the	middle atlantic coast of north america.	4.239734675761467
14356. his chief discovery was important-	the great north river- but it produced	no northwest passage.	5.293031822662472
14357. when the half moon put in at	dartmouth england in the fall of 1609 word of hudson's findings	leaked out and english interest in him revived.	3.8148183953766743
14358. the government	forbade hudson to return to amsterdam with his ship.	5.549166738999816
14359. he thereupon went	to london and spent the winter talking to men of wealth.	3.816800165973078
14360. by springtime	he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage	of henry prince of wales.	5.491392126635379
14361. he had obtained and provisioned a veteran	ship called the discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one	the largest he had ever commanded.	3.579398682019388
14362. the purpose of this	fourth voyage was clear.	5.909420225875287
14363. a century of exploration had established that	a great land mass north and south america lay between europe	and	the indies.	3.7705079474176055
14364. one by one the openings in the coast that promised a	passage through had been explored and discarded.	5.6588629596081645
14365. in fact hudson's	sail up the great north river had disposed of one of the last hopes.	4.997261660047884
14366. but there remained one mysterious unexplored gap far to	the north.	6.455811996292524
14367. nearly twenty-five years before captain john davis had	noted as he sailed near the arctic circle a very great gulf the	water whirling and roaring as it were the meeting of tides.	3.351577827131995
14368. he	named this opening between baffin island and labrador the furious	overfall.	5.393616896283645
14369. in 1602 george waymouth in the same little discovery that	hudson now commanded had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his	frightened men turned the ship back.	3.3526999795528227
14370. hudson now proposed to sail all	the	way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway.	5.462835860450557
14371. even hudson experienced in arctic sailing and determined as he	was must have had qualms as he slid down the thames.	3.5470352453463008
14372. ahead were perilous	ice-filled waters.	7.3430206708510815
14373. on previous voyages it had been in precisely	such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain.	4.575613565285916
14374. on the second voyage he had turned back at the frozen island of	novaya zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that	he did so of his own free will- which was obviously not the case.	5.2148366552084315
14375. on	the third voyage a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between dutch	and english crew members on the half moon had almost forced him	to head the ship back to amsterdam in mid-atlantic.	3.5185263688196815
14376. worse	his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before.	6.007723825617336
14377. of	only one could he be sure- young john hudson his second son.	3.607498511754639
14378. the	mate robert juet who had kept the journal on the half moon	was experienced- but he was a bitter old man ready to complain or	desert at any opportunity.	5.599376978233232
14379. philip staffe the ship's carpenter was	a good worker but perversely independent.	3.5025972480803396
14380. arnold lodley and michael	perse were like the rest- lukewarm ready to swing against hudson	in a crisis.	5.293628372167067
14381. but men willing to sail at all into waters where	wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find.	3.4192113443667345
14382. hudson	knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer.	7.294745153247165
14383. and	he refused to be anything else.	4.924054970131128
14384. it is believed that hudson	was related to other seafaring men of the muscovy company and was	trained	on company ships.	5.471618699052042
14385. he was a londoner married with three sons.	5.000942724774431
14386. in 1610	hudson was probably in his early forties a good navigator a stubborn	voyager but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession.	4.9316480970496475
14387. hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a	few miles down the thames.	3.7411618405056486
14388. there at the river's edge waited one henry	greene whom hudson listed as a clerk.	5.912770493345914
14389. greene was in actuality	a young ruffian from kent who had broken with his parents in	order to keep the company he preferred- pimps panders and whores.	3.35843172034072
14390. he was not the sort of sailor hudson wanted his backers to see on board	and he had greene wait at gravesend where the discovery picked	him up.	5.452036139691165
14391. for the first three weeks the ship skirted up the	east coast of great britain then turned westward.	4.3363082712516725
14392. on may 11 she	reached iceland.	8.617828950476344
14393. poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the	crew called lousie bay.	3.876000073896419
14394. the subsequent two-weeks wait made the	crew quarrelsome.	5.209993082119099
14395. with hudson looking on his protege greene picked	a fight with the ship's surgeon edward wilson.	3.6117854884818854
14396. the issue was	settled on shore greene winning and wilson remaining ashore determined	to catch the next fishing boat back to england.	4.555012815185542
14397. with difficulty	hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship and they sailed from iceland.	3.934973108008003
14398. early in june the discovery passed desolation	and in mid-june entered the furious overfall.	5.787035201093926
14399. floating ice bore down from the north and west.	5.073035916574301
14400. fog hung	over the route constantly.	6.953181329562874
14401. turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet.	4.754829922614346
14402. the ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic	north pole.	5.353758461050822
14403. as the bergs grew larger hudson was	forced to turn south into what is now ungava bay an inlet of the	great strait.	3.4205116678215375
14404. after finding that its coasts led nowhere however he	turned north again toward the main ice-filled passageway- and the	crew at first uneasy then frightened rebelled.	4.7930585805683785
14405. the trouble	was at least partly juet's doing.	3.732808155747334
14406. for weeks he had been saying that	hudson's idea of sailing through to java was absurd.	6.026375984544556
14407. the great	crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice	of pure reason.	3.163521136352798
14408. a group of sailors announced to hudson that they would	sail no farther.	6.034679113673448
14409. instead of quelling the dissension as many	captains of the era would have done	hudson decided to be reasonable.	3.896985422221545
14410. he went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart which	he set up in view of the crew.	6.44058679638561
14411. patiently he explained what he knew	about their course and their objectives.	3.847554598437605
14412. when hudson had finished	the town meeting broke down into a general wordy	argument.	6.2763344984104465
14413. one man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds he would give ninety	of them to be back in england.	4.6429331722823814
14414. up spoke carpenter staffe who	said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home.	5.526079340218114
14415. the meeting broke up.	4.338222572957455
14416. hudson was free to sail on.	7.6586641624947065
14417. all through july the discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long	strait avoiding ice and rocky islands.	3.6959855582662144
14418. on august 3 two massive	headlands reared out of the mists- great gateways never before	so far as hudson knew seen by europeans.	5.468047558875993
14419. to starboard was a cape	a thousand feet high patched with ice and snow populated by thousands	of screaming sea birds.	3.386048689068941
14420. to port was a point 200 feet high rising behind	to a precipice of 2000 feet.	5.481006201449294
14421. hudson named the capes digges and	wolstenholme for two of his backers.	4.285525618655276
14422. hudson pointed the discovery	down the east coast of the newly discovered sea	confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the	pacific.	6.01323243382709
14423. after three weeks' swift sailing however the ship entered	an area of shallow marshes and river deltas.	3.7216864372203506
14424. the	great sea to the westwards was a dead end.	6.565380809492555
14425. this must have	been hudson's blackest discovery.	4.698994017707924
14426. for he seemed to sense at once	that before him was no south sea but the solid bulk of the north	american continent.	5.683611474052741
14427. this was the bitter end and hudson seemed to	know he was destined to failure.	4.109505326826519
14428. feverishly he tried to brush	away this intuition.	6.526393250774891
14429. north and south east and west back and forth	he sailed in the land-locked bay plowing furiously forward until land	appeared then turning to repeat the process day after day week after	week.	3.460430928573211
14430. hundreds of miles to the north the route back to england	through the furious overfall was again filling with ice.	6.1410023441594905
14431. the men were at first puzzled then angered by the aimless tacking.	3.710188389255284
14432. once more juet's complaints were the loudest.	7.565083528394199
14433. hudson's reply	was to accuse the mate of disloyalty.	3.872231141347307
14434. juet demanded that hudson prove	his charges in an open trial.	6.212078738699951
14435. the trial was held september	10.	4.951273568761697
14436. hudson presiding heard juet's defense then called for testimony	from crew members.	5.797204168906921
14437. juet had made plentiful enemies several men	stepped forward.	4.251078231078398
14438. hands on bible seaman lodley and carpenter staffe	swore that juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords	in their cabins.	5.302762591852265
14439. cook bennett mathues said juet had predicted	bloodshed on the ship.	3.7191087655684076
14440. others added that juet had wanted to turn the	ship homeward.	6.8440785983057655
14441. hudson deposed juet and cut his pay.	4.907256604417662
14442. the new	mate was robert bylot talented but inexperienced.	5.014920437595668
14443. there were other	shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves.	4.452695039245025
14444. the important result however was that juet and francis	clemens the deposed boatswain became hudson's sworn enemies.	4.866974532442241
14445. as hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little	bay every incident lessened the crew's respect for him.	3.425421348747567
14446. once	after the discovery lay for a week in rough weather hudson ordered	the anchor raised before the sea had calmed.	5.322054732910231
14447. just as it was being	hauled inboard a sea hit the ship.	5.174245336358211
14448. michael butt and adame moore	were thrown off the capstan and badly injured.	5.1767217714734155
14449. the anchor cable would	have been lost overboard but philip staffe was on hand to sever	it with his axe.	3.235835301322061
14450. thomas douglas fifth earl of selkirk a noble humanitarian	scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native highlands	conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the red river	of the north.	5.466067680241783
14451. since the land he desired lay within the great northern	empire of the hudson's bay company he purchased great blocks of	the comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies.	3.327116243259283
14452. having	achieved this end he was able to buy 116000 square miles in the	valleys of the red and assiniboine rivers.	5.780433731122607
14453. the grant which stretched	southward to lake traverse- the headwaters of the red- was	made in may 1811 and by october of that year a small group of scots	was settling for the winter at york factory on hudson bay.	3.0635024047780792
14454. thus	at the same time that william henry harrison was preparing to pacify	the aborigines of indiana territory and winning fame at the battle	of tippecanoe anglo-saxon settlement made a great leap into the	center of the north american continent to the west of the american	agricultural frontier.	5.1024000232592455
14455. seven hundred miles south of york factory	at the forks of the red and the assiniboine twenty-three	men located a settlement in august 1812.	3.720344172360203
14456. by october the little	colony about fort douglas numbered 100.	6.4059580821538615
14457. within	a few years the scots engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring	the rich soil of the valley were joined by a group called meurons.	3.4400754387874244
14458. the latter members of two regiments of swiss mercenaries transported	by great britain to canada to fight the americans in the	war of 1812 had settled in montreal and kingston at the close of	the war in 1815.	4.7725882111521685
14459. selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go	to red river where they were to serve as a military force to protect	his settlers from the hostile northwest company which resented the	intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire.	3.260483228045761
14460. the mercenaries	were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of	the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as	1818.	4.525058373887604
14461. it was the low yield of the selkirk plots and the ravages	of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement	southward.	3.82995120453051
14462. when late in the summer the full extent of the damage was	assessed all but fifty of the scots swiss and metis moved up	the red to the mouth of the pembina river.	5.439941789774914
14463. here they built huts and	a stockade named fort daer after selkirk's barony in scotland.	3.7308868663642594
14464. the new site was somewhat warmer than fort douglas and much closer	to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for	food.	5.031407068131364
14465. the selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move	southward by british fur traders.	3.25630140190918
14466. for many years the northwest company	had its southern headquarters at prairie du chien on the mississippi	river some 300 miles southeast of present-day st paul	minnesota.	5.594941194904661
14467. when in 1816 an act of congress forced the foreign firm	out of the united states its british-born employees now become american	citizens- joseph rolette joseph renville and alexis bailly-	continued in the fur business.	3.4830855393112636
14468. on big stone lake near the	headwaters of the red river robert dickson superintendent of	the western indian department of canada had a trading post and planned	in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small	artillery pieces.	4.9926028731762
14469. his trading goods came from canada to the forks	of red river and from selkirk's settlement he brought them south	in carts.	3.532831985821469
14470. these carts were of a type devised in pembina in the days	of alexander henry the younger about a decade before the selkirk	colony was begun.	5.230993522117324
14471. in 1802 henry referred to our new carts as	being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as	a horse could pack.	3.607927278565776
14472. they were held together by pegs and withes and	in later times drawn by a single ox in thills.	5.493168538356528
14473. it was dickson	who suggested to lord selkirk that he return to the atlantic coast	by way of the united states.	4.495058948714011
14474. in september 1817 at fort daer	dickson met the noble lord whom with the help of a band of sioux	he escorted to prairie du chien.	5.251871593275629
14475. during the trip selkirk decided	that the route through illinois territory to indiana and the eastern	united states was the best route for goods from england to reach	red river and that the united states was a better source of supply	for many goods than either canada or england.	3.5239444128387225
14476. upon arriving at	baltimore selkirk on december 22 wrote to john quincy adams	secretary of state at washington inquiring about laws covering trade	with missouri and illinois territories.	4.731227069624645
14477. this traffic he	declared prophetically tho' it might be of small account at first	would increase with the progress of our settlements h.	3.6297205403367996
14478. the route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop	into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might	have expected.	5.04159924411387
14479. in 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at the	forks and in december 1819 twenty men left fort	daer for the most northerly american outpost at prairie du chien.	3.4130260462020052
14480. it was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three	months of labor on mackinac boats.	5.5713983404390595
14481. with these completed and ice	gone from the st peter's river	their 250 bushels of wheat 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels	of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats	and rowed up the river to big stone lake across into lake traverse	and down the red.	3.059142134489093
14482. they reached fort douglas in june 1820.	6.985954990481667
14483. this	epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost selkirk 1040.	3.851331813616014
14484. nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were	forced to retreat to fort daer for food.	5.343021833000089
14485. thereafter seed and food became	more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round.	4.366090797720429
14486. activity by british traders and the presence of a colony	on the red prompted the united state war department in 1819 to send	lieutenant-colonel henry leavenworth from detroit to put a post	300 miles northwest of prairie du chien until then the most advanced	united states post.	4.761485966651116
14487. in september 1822 two companies of infantry	arrived at the mouth of the st peter's river the head of navigation	on the mississippi and began construction of fort st	anthony which upon completion was renamed in honor of its commander	colonel josiah snelling.	3.3796429333349107
14488. it was from the american outposts	that red river shortages of livestock were to be made good.	6.804911145053444
14489. hercules	l dousman fur trader and merchant at prairie du chien contracted	to supply selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle and	alexis bailly and francois labothe were hired as drovers.	3.048496378383041
14490. bailly	after leaving fort snelling in august 1821 was forced to leave	some of the cattle at the hudson's bay company's post on lake	traverse in the sieux country and reached fort garry as the	selkirk hudson's bay company center was now called late in the	fall.	4.55685783310136
14491. he set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families	of discontented and disappointed swiss who turned their eyes toward	the united states.	3.3635281212732284
14492. observing their distressing condition colonel	snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military	reservation.	5.050232592619492
14493. as these swiss were moving from the selkirk	settlement to become the first civilian residents of minnesota dousman	of michilimackinac michigan and prairie du chien was traveling	to red river to open a trade in merchandise.	3.447767796833101
14494. early in 1822 he was	at fort garry offering to bring in pork flour liquor and tobacco.	5.723331908805685
14495. alexander mcdonnell governor of red river and james bird	a chief factor of the hudson's bay company ordered such sundry	articles to a value of 4500.	3.374343266760467
14496. for its part the hudson's	bay company was troubled by the approach of american settlement.	6.227791750396172
14497. as the time drew near for the drawing of the british-american frontier	by terms of the agreement of 1818 the company suspected that the	pembina colony- its own post and fort daer- was on american	territory.	3.40117112065283
14498. accordingly selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move	north and by october john halkett had torn down both posts floating	the timber to the forks in rafts.	4.786317457613173
14499. i have done everything	he wrote to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment	h.	4.816811932307341
14500. despite company threats duly carried through to cut	off supplies of powder ball and thread for fishing nets about 350	persons stayed in the village.	4.956055279116402
14501. they would attempt to bring supplies	from st louis or prairie du chien at great expense as well	as danger.	3.9099326170425264
14502. at fort garry some of the swiss also decided	to cast their lot with the united states and in 1823 several families	paid guides to take them to fort snelling.	6.182606778280277
14503. the disasters of 1825-1826	caused more to leave.	3.6026445914056278
14504. after heavy rains and an onslaught of mice	snow fell on october 15 1825 and remained on the ground through	a winter so cold that the ice on the red was five feet thick.	4.918731905541047
14505. in april	came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until	mid-june.	3.6200257522840564
14506. on june 24 more than 400 families started the three-month	trip across the plains to the mississippi.	5.829798051828565

14612. the popularity of folklore in america stands in direct proportion	to the popularity of nationalism in america.	5.280680018183611
14613. and the emphasis on nationalism	in america is in proportion to the growth of american influence	across the world.	4.322217865239808
14614. thus if we are to observe american folklore	in the twentieth century we will do well to establish the relationships	between folklore nationalism and imperialism at the outset.	6.130338737308098
14615. historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism	every age rewrites the events	of its history in terms of what should have been creating legends	about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary	actions.	3.44504985020844
14616. what actually occurred in the past is seldom as important	as a country	superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others it searches	its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness.	5.156978865864451
14617. its folklore	and legend usually disguised as history are allowed to account	for group actions to provide a focal point for group loyalty and to	become a cohesive force for national identification.	3.3650312044345467
14618. one can apply	these facts to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries	as she spread her dominion over palm and pine and they can be	applied again to the united states in more recent years.	5.595673858174777
14619. the popularity	of local color literature before the spanish-american war the	steady currency of the lincoln myth the increased emphasis on the	frontier west in our mass media are cases in point.	2.9659391419425383
14620. nor is it an accident	that baseball growing into the national game in the last 75 years	has become a microcosm of american life that learned societies such	as the american folklore society and the american historical	association were founded in the 1880s or that courses in american literature	american civilization american anything have swept our school	and college curricula.	4.874903501076716
14621. of course nationalism has really	outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours and its	continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the	twentieth-century	united states.	3.668530056421257
14622. yet nationalism has lost few of its	charms for the historian writer or man in the street.	5.982548809520852
14623. it is an understandable	paradox that most american history and most american literature	is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic	point of view at the very time america is spreading her dominion	over palm and pine.	3.5371142575334567
14624. after all the average american as he lies and	waits for the enemy in korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain	hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or	her plight is the result of a complex of personal economic and governmental	actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control.	5.06612578745593
14625. anyone's identification with an international struggle whether	warlike or peaceful requires absurd oversimplification and intense	emotional involvement.	3.389548142225757
14626. such identification comes for each group in each	crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate	national heroes.	5.272346384626087
14627. in america such self-deception has served	a particularly useful purpose.	3.963470865481852
14628. a heterogeneous people have needed it	to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and	ever-changing	land.	5.5991233737645185
14629. but we must never forget most of the appropriate	heroes and their legends were created overnight to answer immediate needs	almost always with conscious aims and ends.	3.6359879691123926
14630. parson weems's george	washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of	the uniting states.	5.343336809989916
14631. abraham lincoln emerged as an incarnation of	the national constitution.	3.9267233572837936
14632. robert e lee represented the dignity	needed by a rebelling confederacy.	6.056505437531987
14633. and their roles are paralleled by	those of patrick henry nathan hale andrew jackson davy crockett	theodore roosevelt and many many more.	3.226277631986375
14634. therefore the	scholar as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years	most of the legends that are created	to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are	the concept that an american national	folklore exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend.	4.653625936711027
14635. folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group	of people preserve vary and recreate through oral transmission.	3.478508650225037
14636. it	has come to mean myths legends tales songs proverbs riddles superstitions	rhymes and such literary forms of expression.	4.993182234860855
14637. related to	written literature and often remaining temporarily frozen in written	form it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral	existence.	3.1603246843976986
14638. though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies	it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter.	6.000868438829295
14639. in its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our	folk heritage the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as	this.	3.4989202103184427
14640. enthusiastically americans have swept subliterary and bogus	materials like paul bunyan tales abe lincoln anecdotes and labor	union songs up as true products of our american oral tradition.	4.496699797812079
14641. nor	have we remembered that in the melting pot of america the hundreds of	isolated and semi-isolated ethnic regional and occupational groups did	not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education	and industrialization	had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as	a means of carrying culturally significant material.	3.124880441711414
14642. naturally	such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make	money or fan patriotism by means of folklore.	5.450819613216656
14643. that much of what he	calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people	with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction	to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant.	3.4531983103807837
14644. as long	as his material is americana can in some way be ascribed to the masses	and appears democratic to his audience he remains satisfied.	5.301393063358247
14645. from all this we can now see that two streams of development	run through the history of twentieth-century american folklore.	4.249121094883736
14646. on	the one side we have the university professors and their students trained	in teutonic methods of research who have sought out collected	and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic	regional and occupational groups that make up this nation.	5.212080524509343
14647. on the other	we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been	willing to use any patriotic frontier western or colonial material	willy-nilly.	3.4947768031962774
14648. unfortunately few of the artists	who have used american folklore	since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams	even in the most general of ways.	5.830366728356786
14649. after all the field is large difficult	to define and seldom taught properly to american undergraduates.	4.109248698884216
14650. in addition this country has been settled by many peoples of many	heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly in an age of	print and easy communication within an ever-expanding and changing society.	5.022547268105706
14651. the problems confuse even the experts.	3.9187784020083396
14652. for that matter	the experts themselves are a mixed breed.	6.943961823869843
14653. anthropologists housewives	historians and such by profession they approach their discipline	as amateurs collectors commercial propagandists analysts or some combination	of the four.	3.089929375474509
14654. they have widely varying backgrounds and aims.	7.707208562355284
14655. they have little esprit de corps.	5.579924127450785
14656. the outlook for the	amateur for instance is usually dependent on his fondness for local	history or for the picturesque.	5.197553983517495
14657. his love of folklore has romanticism	in it and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote.	3.629445752317321
14658. folklore is his hobby and he all too rightly wishes it to remain	as such.	5.722473702862179
14659. the amateur is closely related to the collector who is	actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field.	3.9383966771887113
14660. the collector	enjoys the contact with rural life; he hunts folklore for the	very field and stream reasons that many persons hunt game; and	only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has	located.	4.724985607045022
14661. fundamentally both these types the amateur and the collector	are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between	real folklore and bogus material.	3.5284641107971555
14662. but there are also the commercial	propagandists and the analysts- one dominated by money the other	by nineteenth-century german scholarship.	5.730722013966938
14663. both are primarily concerned	with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector	has found.	4.4437749535625475
14664. both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond	the sewage system and the electric light lines.	5.808780069108387
14665. the commercial propagandist	who can't afford to be critical gets along well with the	amateur from whom he feeds but he frequently steps on the analyst's	toes by refusing to keep his material genuine.	3.003492169199115
14666. his standards are	of course completely foreign to those of the analyst.	6.805033854621803
14667. to both the amateur	and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul lacks appreciation	with his endless probings and classifications.	3.5883818778973526
14668. dominated by	the vicious circle of the university promotion system the analyst looks	down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups although	he cannot deny his debt to the collector.	5.234954495035173
14669. the knowledge that	most americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial	propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors.	3.2977167755295347
14670. the work	done by the analysts the men who really know what folklore is all about	has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort	and reaches a limited learned audience.	5.002857607657291
14671. publishers want books that	will sell recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to	ears used to hillbilly and jazz music grade and high schools want quaint	but moral material.	3.1050860538352363
14672. the analyst is apt to be too honest to fit	in.	6.108280345240351
14673. as a result most people don't have more than a vague idea what	folklore actually is; they see it as a potpourri of charming moral	legends and patriotic anecdotes with a superstition or remedy thrown	in here and there.	3.539282177118174
14674. and so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur	and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the	hundred-odd folklore courses given in the united states survive on sentiment	and nationalism alone.	5.457447201062681
14675. if one wishes to discuss a literary	figure who uses folklore in his work the first thing he must realize	is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant american	public.	3.8536546883749736
14676. and while every writer must be dealt with as a special	case the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions	about each.	5.467230504306217
14677. does the writer know the difference between an ersatz	ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk?	4.143168988459315
14678.  when	the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial	effect or does he leave it pure?	5.360778805358215
14679.  is the writer propagandistic?	7.463754447514029
14680. 	is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an america that was?	5.322820982344415
14681. 	or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of american	attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they	may be?	3.0981338396967595
14682.    when he gets the answers to his questions he will be	discouraged.	7.458703807307273
14683. in the first place a good many writers who are said to	use folklore do not unless one counts an occasional superstition or	tale.	3.8329482323001343
14684. robert frost for instance writes about rural life in new england	but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in	his poems.	5.722115313667493
14685. this has not however prevented publishers from labeling	him a folk poet simply because he is a rural one.	4.193111846324983
14686. in the second	place a large number of writers making a more direct claim than frost	to being folk writers of one sort or another clearly make	no distinctions between genuine and bogus material.	4.804382662964549
14687. stephen vincent	benet's john brown's body comes immediately to mind in this	connection as does john steinbeck's the grapes of wrath	and carl sandburg's the people yes.	3.0180152686253314
14688. the last two writers	introduce strong political bias into their works and not unlike the union	leaders that we will discuss soon see folklore as a reservoir of	protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass.	4.6709179066692155
14689. folklore as	used by such writers really reflects images engraved into it by the very	person using it.	3.7671715840646627
14690. the folk are simply not homogeneous with respect	to nation or political attitude.	5.149483804145759
14691. in fact there is much evidence to	indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular	regional ethnic and occupational limits.	3.7602803887976184
14692. nevertheless with a reading	public that longs for the good old days and with an awareness	of our expanding international interests it is easy for the benets	to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of	americana real or fake and it is easy for the steinbecks and sandburgs	to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform	into the minds of the folk.	5.02609396089018
14693. as part of the same arrangement torrio had in the spirit of peace	and good will and in exchange for armed support in the april election	campaign bestowed upon o'banion a third share in the hawthorne	smoke shop proceeds and a cut in the cicero beer trade.	4.028481199576978
14694. the coalition	was to prove inadvisable.	5.796364078801092
14695. o'banion was a complex and frightening	man whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour	into others'.	3.610352529551028
14696. he had a round frank irish face creased in a	jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets	into someone's body.	5.51901391848393
14697. he carried three guns- one in the right	trouser pocket one under his left armpit one in the left outside coat	pocket- and was equally lethal with both hands.	3.454531306071416
14698. he killed accurately	freely and dispassionately.	7.018463612176696
14699. the police credited him with twenty-five	murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them.	3.952834170340022
14700. like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol.	6.767733594970962
14701. he was an expert	florist tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths.	3.928526380180934
14702. he had no apparent comprehension of morality; he divided humanity	into right guys and wrong guys and the wrong ones he	was always willing to kill and trample under.	5.102404557212536
14703. he had what was described	by a psychologist as a sunny brutality.	4.253314812421402
14704. he walked with a heavy	list to the right as that leg was four inches shorter than the other	but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns.	5.0825419502091425
14705. landesco	thought him just a superior sort of plugugly but he was	in fact with his aggression and hostility and nerveless indifference	to risking or administering pain a casebook psychopath.	3.0386814950933965
14706. he was also	at this time although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets	as torrio and capone the most powerful and most dangerous mob	leader in the chicago underworld the roughneck king.	4.879881206270596
14707. o'banion	was born in poverty the son of an immigrant irish plasterer	in the north side's little hell close by the sicilian quarter	and death corner.	3.349776265955869
14708. he had been a choir boy at the holy name cathedral	and also served as an acolyte to father o'brien.	5.913869133811326
14709. the influence	of mass was less pervasive than that of the congested slum tenements	among the bawdy houses honkytonks and sawdust saloons of his birthplace;	he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood and	went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving police-dodging	and housebreaking.	2.927043802258212
14710. at the age of ten when he was working as	a newsboy in the loop he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted	in his permanently shortened leg.	5.575405252634135
14711. because of this he was known as	gimpy	.	5.688451798697071
14712. in his teens o'banion was enrolled in the vicious	market street gang and he became a singing waiter in mcgovern's	cafe a notoriously low and rowdy dive in north clark street where	befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing	waiters before being thrown out.	4.439932822192848
14713. he then got a job with the chicago	herald-examiner as a circulation slugger a rough fighter	employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon	by rival vendors.	3.531143271545994
14714. he was also at the same time gaining practical	experience as a safe breaker and highwayman and learning how to shoot	to kill from a neanderthal convicted murderer named gene geary later	committed to chester asylum as a homicidal maniac but whose eyes	misted with tears when the young dion sang a ballad about an irish	mother in his clear and syrupy tenor.	4.459265041173106
14715. o'banion's first conflict	with the police came in 1909 at seventeen when he was committed	to bridewell prison for three months for burglary; two years	later he served another three months for assault.	3.3462069269590176
14716. those were his only	interludes behind bars although he collected four more charges on his	police record in 1921 and 1922 three for burglary and one for robbery.	5.058304861559922
14717. but by now o'banion's political pull was beginning to be effective.	4.358815443052118
14718. on the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10000 bond was	furnished by an alderman and the charge was nolle prossed.	5.25921616661183
14719. on one	of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a detective sergeant	john j ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour	office safe in the postal telegraph building; the jury wanted	better evidence than that and he was acquitted at a cost of $30000	in bribes it was estimated.	3.2004833379870923
14720. as promptly as torrio o'banion jumped	into bootlegging.	6.633055244632644
14721. he conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous	violence than the sicilians but he had his huge north side	portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money.	3.785183248865057
14722. unlike the	sicilians he additionally conducted holdups robberies and safe-cracking	expeditions and refused to touch prostitution.	5.409346306168594
14723. he was also personally	active in ward politics and by 1924 o'banion had acquired	sufficient political might to be able to state: i always deliver	my borough as per requirements.	3.43299644614213
14724. but whose requirements?	9.41818392225925
14725. 	until 1924 o'banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had	kept his north side domain solidly democratic.	3.1554562043264105
14726. there was a question-and-answer	gag that went around at that time: q who'll	carry the forty-second and forty-third wards?	5.574793713827561
14727.  a o'banion	in his pistol pocket.	4.378794343344965
14728. but as november 1924 drew close the democratic	hierarchy	was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that o'banion	was being wooed by the opposition and was meeting and conferring	with important republicans.	4.776969238134366
14729. to forestall any change of allegiance	the democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for o'banion	as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where	his loyalties lay.	3.2710012910513684
14730. the reception was held in a private dining	room of the webster hotel on lincoln park west.	5.0809660587991825
14731. it was an interesting	fraternisation of ex-convicts union racketeers ward heelers	sold-out officials and gunmen.	3.7357734102807822
14732. the guest list is in itself a little	parable of the state of american civic life at this time.	5.857138469659551
14733. it included	the top o'banion men and chief of detectives michael hughes.	4.221444310136413
14734. when mayor dever heard of the banquet he summoned hughes	for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department	by consorting with these felons and fixers.	5.132647384699092
14735. hughes said that he had	understood the party was to be in honour of jerry o'connor the	proprieter of a loop gambling house.	4.038755718627504
14736. but when i arrived and recognised	a number of notorious characters i had thrown into the detective	bureau basement half a dozen times i knew i had been framed and	withdrew almost at once.	5.120871434301028
14737. in fact o'connor was honoured	during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin.	3.7721282784279726
14738. there was a brief interruption while one of o'banion's men	jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering	him for a tip.	5.305228723776154
14739. then o'banion was presented with a platinum	watch set with rubies and diamonds.	3.8872698739288243
14740. this dinner was the start	of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians	which prior to 1924 says pasley had been maintained with	more or less stealth but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious	gatherings denounced by a clergyman as belshazzar feasts	at which politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters	openly in the big downtown hotels.	4.330920370439309
14741. pasley continued: they	became an institution of the chicago scene and marked the way to the	moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments	in 1928-29.	3.6618559295679374
14742. however this inaugural feast did its sponsors	no good whatever.	6.568091065032399
14743. o'banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes	to his loyalty and proceeded with the bigger and better republican	deal.	3.421845915687231
14744. on election day- november 4- he energetically marshalled	his force of bludgeon men bribers and experts in forging repeat	votes.	5.137860191737925
14745. the result was a landslide for the republican candidates.	4.161260416786232
14746. this further demonstration of o'banion's ballooning power	did not please torrio and capone.	5.219411838969384
14747. in the past year there had been	too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement	for their liking.	3.8217325993476727
14748. he behaved publicly with a cocky swaggering truculence	that offended their vulpine latin minds and behaved towards	them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath	their blandness.	4.326172009600861
14749. they were disturbed by his idiotic bravado- as	when his bodyguard yankee schwartz complained that he had been snubbed	by dave miller a prize-fight referee chieftain of a jewish	gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation who were hirschey	a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with torrio and o'banion	frank a policeman and max the youngest.	3.1055378033093626
14750. to settle this	slight o'banion went down to the la salle theatre in the loop	where he had learned dave miller was attending the opening of	a musical comedy.	5.083624924001097
14751. at the end of the performance dave and max came	out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed	first nighters.	3.7708656269662377
14752. o'banion drew his guns and fired at dave severely	wounding him in the stomach.	5.862391494860694
14753. a second bullet ricocheted off max's	belt buckle leaving him unhurt but in some distress.	3.712344677589218
14754. o'banion	tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre; he was neither	prosecuted nor even arrested.	5.6658489646113415
14755. that sort of braggadocio for that sort	of reason in the view of torrio and capone was a nonsense.	4.291309295638629
14756. a further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was	when two policemen held up a torrio beer convoy on a west side street	and demanded $300 to let it through.	4.977270642685434
14757. one of the beer-runners telephoned	o'banion- on a line tapped by the detective bureau- and	reported the situation.	3.700032494138171
14758. o'banion's reaction was: three hundred	dollars! to them bums?	5.829231886115163
14759.  why i can get them knocked off for	half that much.	4.532739699231295
14760. upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle	squads to prevent trouble if o'banion should send his gunmen out	to deal with the hijacking policemen.	5.243763537466398
14761. but in the meantime the beer-runner	unhappy with this solution telephoned torrio and returned to	o'banion with the message: say dionie i just been talking	to johnny and he said to let them cops have the three hundred.	3.496453904876131
14762. he	says he don't want no trouble.	6.4830934300900225
14763. but torrio and capone had	graver cause to hate and distrust the irishman.	3.988416815989557
14764. for three years	since the liquor territorial conference torrio had with his elastic	patience and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent	warfare and disaster to business tolerated o'banion's impudent	double-crossing.	4.860979482545153
14765. they had suffered in sulky silence the sight of	his sharp practice in cicero.	3.892213388300137
14766. when as a diplomatic gesture	of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the april election	torrio had given o'banion a slice of cicero the profits from	that district had been $20000 a month.	4.82315546363479
14767. in six months o'banion had	boosted the profits to $100000 a month- mainly by bringing pressure	to bear on fifty chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the	suburb.	3.1455192695372767
14768. these booze customers had until then been buying their supplies	from the sheldon saltis-mcerlane and druggan-lake gangs	and now they were competing for trade with the torrio-capone saloons;	once again o'banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation	of ill will.	4.363299995072196
14769. the revenue from o'banion's cicero territory	went up still higher until the yield was more than the torrio-capone	takings from the far bigger trade area of chicago's south and	west sides.	3.270117764703435
14770. but he still showed no intention of sharing with the	syndicate.	6.904741455294685
14771. at last even the controlled torrio was unable to hold still	and he tentatively suggested that o'banion should take a percentage	in the stickney brothels in return for one from his cicero beer	concession.	3.5150814492473303
14772. o'banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal.	5.802738928574768
14773. still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the o'banion	gang's seizure from a west side marshalling yard of a freight-car	load of canadian whisky worth $100000 and by one of the biggest	coups of the prohibition era- the sibley warehouse robbery	which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation.	3.1199955486996904
14774. here was	stored $1000000 worth of bonded whisky.	7.110546329340116
14775. these 1750 cases were carted	off in a one-night operation by the o'banion men who left in	their stead the same number of barrels filled with water.	3.298289796868936
14776. a tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide an earthquake	or a volcanic eruption.	5.316541664550725
14777. the most infamous of all was launched by the	explosion of the island of krakatoa in 1883; it raced across the pacific	at 300 miles an hour devastated the coasts of java and sumatra	with waves 100 to 130 feet high and pounded the shore as far away	as san francisco.	3.0771600624525837
14778. the ancient greeks recorded several catastrophic	inundations by huge waves.	4.93477398084845
14779. whether or not plato's tale of	the lost continent of atlantis is true skeptics concede that the myth	may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times.	3.458769702513656
14780. indeed	a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the arabian sea	in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists	in the biblical story of the flood.	4.951098155982842
14781. one of the most damaging	tsunami on record followed the famous lisbon earthquake of november	1 1755; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away	as the english coast.	3.673417915543668
14782. tsunami are rare however in the atlantic	ocean; they are far more common in the pacific.	6.234118263045057
14783. japan has had 15	destructive ones since 1596.	4.409568632654016
14784. the hawaiian	islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years.	5.203160651303985
14785. in 1707 an earthquake in japan generated waves so huge that they piled	into the inland sea; one wave swamped more than 1000 ships and	boats in osaka bay.	3.08709740227152
14786. a tsunami in the hawaiian islands in 1869	washed away an entire town leaving only two forlorn trees	standing where the community had been.	4.923476378581387
14787. in 1896 a japanese tsunami killed	27000 people and swept away 10000 homes.	3.765611835673706
14788. the dimensions	of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement.	4.955708063978362
14789. an ordinary	sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to	crest- no longer than 320 feet in the atlantic or 1000 feet in the	pacific.	3.7548209347727175
14790. but a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes	as much as 600 miles from crest to crest.	5.7682684221900695
14791. while a wind wave never	travels at more than 60 miles per hour the velocity of a tsunami in	the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour.	3.8107672681635125
14792. the greater	the depth of the water the greater is the speed of the wave;	lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of	the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity.	4.97822400540345
14793. in	the deep waters of the pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles	per hour.	4.115033662317976
14794. tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length	that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable.	5.762750455320563
14795. their amplitude	sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest.	4.188193632640667
14796. usually it	is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build	up to their terrifying heights.	5.829196997217348
14797. on the fateful day in 1896 when the	great waves approached japan fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells.	3.4723556638758666
14798. not until they sailed home at the end of the day through a sea	strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses were they aware of what	had happened.	5.796700664400545
14799. the seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water	from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers drowning	thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore.	2.988988095500783
14800. the	giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones.	5.512738906264294
14801. they	usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height but when they pour into	a v-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions.	3.225259920133523
14802. generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell	not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers.	5.679850904537833
14803. this is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore	as the first great trough arrives.	4.2678649528529755
14804. reefs are left high and dry and	the beaches are covered with stranded fish.	5.531777198781952
14805. at hilo large numbers	of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach.	3.772937677165987
14806. many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives for some	minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore.	5.667905826060847
14807. after an earthquake	in japan in 1793 people on the coast at tugaru were so terrified	by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher	ground.	3.5184910041238946
14808. when a second quake came they dashed back to the beach	fearing that they might be buried under landslides.	6.4653840173061585
14809. just as they reached	the shore the first huge wave crashed upon them.	4.486615751903594
14810. a tsunami	is not a single wave but a series.	6.3495956241150315
14811. the waves are separated by intervals	of 15 minutes to an hour or more	and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great	wave has crashed that it is all over.	3.5485050642182165
14812. the waves may keep coming for many	hours.	5.682544619344219
14813. usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the	biggest.	4.753170488560258
14814. among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at hilo was	francis p shepard of the scripps institution of oceanography	one of the world's foremost marine geologists.	4.962917104018775
14815. he was able to make	a detailed inspection of the waves.	5.028118994121712
14816. their onrush and retreat he reported	was accompanied by a great hissing roaring and rattling.	5.7371107898292815
14817. the	third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest.	5.19330259066995
14818. on some of the islands'	beaches the waves came in gently; they were steepest on the	shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come.	5.94312210454231
14819. in hilo bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high.	3.836369455779967
14820. the highest waves	55 feet occurred at pololu valley.	5.394489840545958
14821. scientists and fishermen	have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon.	3.935306754343909
14822. during	a 1933 tsunami in japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night.	5.736822461624465
14823. the	luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the	stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism noctiluca miliaris	by the turbulence of the sea.	3.6404611752356333
14824. japanese fishermen have sometimes	observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have	enormously swollen stomachs; the fish have swallowed vast numbers	of bottom-living diatoms raised to the surface by the disturbance.	4.570763999933075
14825. the	waves of a 1923 tsunami in sagami bay brought to the surface and	battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth	of 3000 feet.	3.236908191211317
14826. gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands.	6.533693042209724
14827. the tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in	hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised	by commander c k green of the coast and geodetic survey staff.	2.969509691089846
14828. it consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber	which record the rise and fall of the water surface.	6.367047692481048
14829. ordinary water	tides are disregarded.	5.529907949732825
14830. but when waves with a period of between 10 and	40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean they set in motion a corresponding	oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit.	5.0314623855487675
14831. this in turn sets off an alarm notifying the observers at the	station that a tsunami is in progress.	3.799543278685722
14832. such equipment has been installed	at hilo midway attu and dutch harbor.	5.89064791861986
14833. the moment the alarm	goes off information is immediately forwarded to honolulu which	is the center of the warning system.	3.5820060336976125
14834. this center also receives	prompt reports on earthquakes from four coast survey stations in the	pacific which are equipped with seismographs.	5.059090317363498
14835. its staff makes a preliminary	determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide	stations near the epicenter for a tsunami.	3.4611743589232535
14836. by means of charts showing	wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations it is	possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival	at hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the pacific.	5.061213072442912
14837. the civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger	and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps.	3.175861070500638
14838. all	of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system	and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work	smoothly.	5.20606663516909
14839. since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami	in the pacific but only one was of any consequence.	4.1599391043973
14840. on november 4	1952 an earthquake occurred under the sea off the kamchatka peninsula.	6.101143421564066
14841. at 17:07 that afternoon the shock was recorded	by the seismograph alarm in honolulu.	3.7638908396749096
14842. the warning system immediately	went into action.	5.801314782891978
14843. within about an hour with the help of reports	from seismic stations in alaska arizona and california the quake's	epicenter was placed at 51 degrees north latitude and 158 degrees	east longitude.	3.3549824567185964
14844. while accounts of the progress of the tsunami came	in from various points in the pacific	the hawaiian station made its calculations	and notified the military services and the police that the first big	wave would arrive at honolulu at 23:30 greenwich time.	4.894729403280938
14845. it	turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946.	4.539310099165339
14846. they hurled a	cement barge against a freighter in honolulu harbor knocked down telephone	lines marooned automobiles flooded lawns killed six cows.	4.661917666039431
14847. but not a single human life was lost and property damage in the hawaiian	islands did not exceed $800000.	4.112971558685508
14848. there is little doubt that the	warning system saved lives and reduced the damage.	6.252802978044813
14849. but it is	plain that a warning system however efficient is not enough.	4.328616213398768
14850. in the	vulnerable areas of the pacific there should be restrictions against	building homes on exposed coasts or at least a requirement that they	be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves.	5.719998424780542
14851. the key to the world of geology is change; nothing remains the	same.	4.427346237428759
14852. life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the	sea to complex combinations in man.	5.247502538847231
14853. the land too is changing and	earthquakes are daily reminders of this.	3.4415092925137114
14854. earthquakes result when movements	in the earth twist rocks until they break.	5.823179458592186
14855. sometimes this is accompanied	by visible shifts of the ground surface; often the shifts	cannot be seen but they are there; and everywhere can be found scars	of earlier breaks once deeply buried.	3.5043856981724115
14856. today's earthquakes are most	numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated	but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth	that has not had them.	5.6707827764715
14857. the effects of earthquakes on civilization	have been widely publicized even overemphasized.	3.4782192013748525
14858. the role of	an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously	frightening but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular	disaster.	4.76528966450784
14859. superstition has often blended with fact to color reports.	3.9573610692888765
14860. we have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know	about the earth's interior for they send waves through the earth	which emerge with information about the materials through which they	have traveled.	5.24865693224948
14861. these waves have shown that 1800 miles below the surface	a liquid core begins and that it in turn has a solid inner core.	3.8890959648292016
14862. earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface	but they do not occur at greater depths.	6.312619420480644
14863. two unsolved mysteries are	based on these facts.	4.635905118399602
14864. as far down as 400 miles below the surface	the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to	twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking as rigid surface	rocks do.	4.896433095422318
14865. if earthquakes do occur at such depths why not deeper?	4.277128998250544
14866. 	knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been	applied in various fields.	5.17723199946372
14867. in the search for oil and gas we make	similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from	them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation	of these resources.	3.2665018086421633
14868. we have also developed techniques for recognizing	and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the	ground which they generate.	5.548267417316218
14869. the following discussion of this subject	has been adapted from the book by	l don leet.	3.7445275364543007
14870. at twelve	minutes after five on the morning of wednesday april 18 1906	san francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake.	5.456626014607467
14871. a sharp tremor	was followed by a jerky roll.	4.45681205808264
14872. ireland's county limerick near the river	shannon there is a quiet little suburb by the name of garryowen which	means garden of owen.	5.752381299987032
14873. undoubtedly none of the residents realize	the influence their town has had on american military history	or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name.	3.721249659190493
14874. the cry garryowen!	bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was	the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of cheyennes	sioux and apaches mexican banditos under pancho villa japanese	in the south pacific and chinese and north korean communists	in korea.	4.236429494089839
14875. garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th u s cavalry	regiment the fighting seventh.	3.9339477793768456
14876. today a battle	cry may seem an anachronism for in the modern army esprit de corps	has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables.	5.245691610759221
14877. but don't	tell that to a veteran of the fighting seventh especially in a	saloon on saturday night.	4.226918311220462
14878. of all the thousands of men who have	served in the 7th cav perhaps no one knows its spirit better than	lieutenant colonel melbourne c chandler.	5.963185423857245
14879. wiry and burr-headed	with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals chandler	is the epitome of the old-time trooper.	3.1915701291696235
14880. the truth is however that	when mel chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he	had ever ridden	was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded	was a pencil.	4.90554823217082
14881. chandler had been commissioned in the medical	service corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the kansas	city medical depot when he decided that if he was going to make	the army his career he wanted to be in the fighting part of it.	3.7971204998872214
14882. though	he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other	desk officer he managed to get transferred to the combat forces.	5.094403759457997
14883. the	next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer	of troop h 7th cavalry in the middle of corps maneuvers in japan.	3.7161581603590137
14884. outside of combat he couldn't have landed in a tougher	spot.	6.4772383961187705
14885. first of all no unit likes to have a new co brought in from	the outside especially when he's an armchair trooper.	4.025186194408475
14886. second	if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him it's	on maneuvers.	5.5519238425552295
14887. in combat helping your co make a fool of himself	might mean getting yourself killed.	3.4950649066921833
14888. but in maneuvers with the top	brass watching him all the time it's easy.	6.578348337649879
14889. chandler understood	this and expected the worst.	4.95246500622391
14890. but his first few days with troop	h were full of surprises beginning with first sergeant robert	early.	6.2467249787589685
14891. chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice.	4.0507154115044735
14892. instead sergeant early was quiet sharp and confident.	7.575619698521976
14893. he had	enlisted in the army straight out of high school and had immediately	set about learning his new trade.	4.122986817382667
14894. there was no weapon early could not	take apart and reassemble blind-folded.	6.377835318756397
14895. he could lead a patrol and	he knew his paper work.	4.298245081235328
14896. further he had taken full advantage of the army's	correspondence courses.	7.041955934416982
14897. he not only knew soldiering but mathematics	history and literature as well.	3.83368024212442
14898. but for all his erudite	confidence sergeant early was right out of the garryowen mold.	7.481879938206818
14899. he was filled with the spirit of the fighting seventh.	5.777933286763673
14900. sergeant early let the new co know just how lucky	he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the united	states army.	6.5157906964285885
14901. he fed the captain bits of history about the troops and	the regiment.	3.900241476359585
14902. for example it was a battalion of the 7th cavalry	under colonel george armstrong custer that had been wiped out at the	battle of the little big horn.	6.140136957584091
14903. it didn't take captain	chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition	on his shoulders as commander of troop h.	4.174044080812938
14904. but what made the	load lighter was the realization that every officer non-com and trooper	was ready and willing to help him carry it for the good of the troop	and the regiment.	5.5491219649436685
14905. maneuvers over the 7th returned to garrison	duty in tokyo captain chandler still with them.	3.621280823899087
14906. it was the	7th cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the imperial	palace of the emperor.	5.265277580292638
14907. but still mel chandler was not completely	convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word garryowen.	3.5168607637685168
14908. the final proof was a small incident.	6.190288032071797
14909. it happened	at the st patrick's day party a big affair for a regiment which	had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains	of an irish march.	3.488211818990374
14910. in the middle of the party chandler looked	up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him each beaming above	the biggest greenest shamrock he had ever seen.	5.555758985407778
14911. the faces belonged	to lieutenant marvin goulding his wife and their two children.	3.6091879581319395
14912. and	when the singing began it was the gouldings who sang the old irish	songs the best.	5.756397453642864
14913. though there was an occasional good-natured	chuckle about marvin goulding the jewish officer from chicago	singing tearfully about the ould sod no one really thought it was strange.	3.6119581637962686
14914. for marvin goulding like giovanni martini the bugler boy	who carried custer's last message or margarito lopez the one-man	army on leyte was a garryowen through and through.	4.470792902836711
14915. it was no	coincidence	that goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders	in the regiment.	4.4779703755235385
14916. and so mel chandler got the spirit of garryowen.	8.450698931391416
14917. he set out to keep troop h the best troop in the best regiment.	4.525911662293298
14918. one of his innovations was to see to it that every man- cook	and clerk as well as rifleman- qualified with every weapon in the	troop.	5.9973006166756395
14919. even the mess sergeant bill brown a dapper cocky transfer	from an airborne division went out on the range.	3.918785815827068
14920. the troop received	a new leader lieutenant robert m carroll fresh out of	rotc and bucking for regular army status.	4.431135307851019
14921. carroll was sharp	and military but he was up against tough competition for that ra	berth and he wanted to play it cool.	3.942088921353137
14922. so mel chandler set out to	sell him on the spirit of garryowen just as he himself had been sold	a short time before.	6.0890333935733265
14923. when the korean war began on june 25	1950 the anniversary of the day custer had gone down fighting at the	little big horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead	of leyte during world war 2 the 7th cavalry was not in the	best fighting condition.	3.7395928866155668
14924. its entire complement of non-commissioned	officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit	and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across luzon in world	war 2.	4.850763621367109
14925. just a month after the korean war broke out	the 7th cavalry was moving into the lines ready for combat.	4.139926537573062
14926. from	then on the fighting seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting	in korea.	6.3473774916811525
14927. one night on the naktong river mel chandler	called on that fabled esprit de corps.	4.0213236518271716
14928. the regiment was dug in	on the east side of the river and the north koreans were steadily building	up a concentration of crack troops on the other side.	5.807894451024307
14929. the troopers	knew an attack was coming but they didn't know when and they	didn't know where.	3.222627131124647
14930. at 6 o'clock on the morning of august 12 they	were in doubt no longer.	6.2549238114677275
14931. then it came against troop h.	5.549099464320532
14932. the enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full	force of 1000 men armed with russian machine guns attacked the position	held by chandler's men.	4.628515793894968
14933. first came the	cannon fodder white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive	human battering ram.	3.5971534445763664
14934. they were followed by crack north korean troops	who mounted one charge after another.	5.673087706860394
14935. they overran the 7th cav's	forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers over	piles of their own dead.	3.6043727979817293
14936. another force flanked the company	and took up a position on a hill to the rear.	5.770158844790279
14937. captain chandler saw	that it was building up strength.	4.475179421820563
14938. he assembled a group of 25 men composed	of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation the company clerk supply	men cooks and drivers and led them to the hill.	5.232965184019713
14939. one of the more	seriously wounded was lieutenant carroll the young officer bucking	for the regular army.	3.712632180232426
14940. chandler left carroll at the bottom of the hill	to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight.	5.729293970106243
14941. then	mel chandler started up the hill.	4.441206635731906
14942. he took one step two broke	into a trot and then into a run.	5.8868139409471
14943. the first thing he knew the words garryowen!	burst from his throat.	4.607216465100136
14944. his followers shouted the old	battle cry after him and charged the hill firing as they ran.	5.354102080031425
14945. the koreans fell back but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned	down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire.	3.588569365844561
14946. chandler looking to	right and left to see how his men were faring suddenly saw another figure	bounding up the hill hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry	as he ran.	5.220147202362677
14947. it was bob carroll who had suddenly found himself imbued	with the spirit of garryowen.	4.259155895822266
14948. he had formed his own task force	of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a fighting seventh charge.	5.808688291795007
14949. because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been	pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again.	4.187574657432675
14950. but an enemy	grenade hit carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously.	6.6074390060799555
14951. he	went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face	of	the withering enemy fire.	3.521539970954128
14952. enemy reinforcements came pouring down	seeking a soft spot.	5.828367945708471
14953. they found it at the junction between troops	h and g and prepared to counterattack.	4.101816472681902
14954. marvin goulding saw	what was happening.	6.876689384772311
14955. he turned to his platoon.	5.565814917566852
14956. goulding leaped to his feet and started forward	garryowen! on his lips his men following.	5.961431842478734
14957. but the bullets	whacked home before he finished his battle cry and marvin goulding	fell dead.	3.8214347227224565
14958. for an instant his men hesitated unable to believe that	their lieutenant	the most popular officer in the regiment was dead.	5.669878679989964
14959. then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and cursing screaming	and hollering garryowen! they charged into the enemy like	wild men.	3.326841744564493
14960. that finished the job that captain chandler and lieutenant	carroll had begun.	6.0986828418291275
14961. goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy	soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack.	3.820533031330459
14962. reinforcements	came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by goulding's	platoon.	6.484561341421357
14963. the north koreans threw away their guns and fled	across the rice paddies.	3.61199946991926
14964. artillery and air strikes were called in	to kill them by the hundreds.	5.628395978615863
14965. though bob carroll seemed to have	had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade he lived.	3.808043354921147
14966. today he is a major- in the regular army.	8.66109834148914
14967. so filled	was mel chandler with the spirit of garryowen that after korea was	over he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment.	4.340530302572398
14968. after years of digging nights and weekends he put together the	big profusely illustrated book of garryowen and glory which	is probably the most complete history of any military unit.	5.098598520125897
14969. the	battle of the naktong river is just one example of how the battle	cry and the spirit of the fighting seventh have paid off.	4.223191289708717
14970. for nearly	a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the	regiment.	5.7856315413666755
14971. take the case of major marcus a reno who survived	the battle of the little big horn in 1876.	4.244169672521282
14972. from the enlisted	men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried	to rape a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike marcus	reno.	5.2297963332233435
14973. many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him.	4.97887238608466
14974. but	when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice	made against him the men who had seen reno leave the battlefield	and the officer who had heard reno suggest that the wounded be left	to be tortured by the sioux refused to say a harsh word against him.	5.181244209107912
14975. he was a member of the fighting seventh.	6.563851951461371
14976. although it was	at	the battle of the little horn about which more words have been	written than any other battle in american history that the 7th cavalry	first made its mark in history the regiment was ten years old by	then.	5.77016850336985
14977. brevet major general george armstrong custer was the regiment's	first permanent commander and like such generals as george	s patton and terry de la mesa allen in their rise to military	prominence	custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare.	2.910211198580926
14978. during	the civil war custer who achieved a brilliant record was	made	brigadier general at the age of 23.	5.9820147196034235
14979. he finished the war as	a major general commanding a full division and at 25 was the youngest	major general in the history of the u s army.	4.0619462356603036
14980. i do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident in	the sense that everyone agrees with them.	5.848370761998196
14981. if they were walter lippmann	would be writing the same columns as george sokolsky and herblock	would have nothing to draw cartoons about.	3.6520564151270056
14982. i do mean however that	i take them for granted and that everything i shall be saying	assumption	the ultimate objective of american policy is to help establish	a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom	and justice and peace and material prosperity; and in particular-	since this is our special responsibility- that these conditions	be enjoyed by the people of the united states.	5.428650201744215
14983. i speak of the largest	possible measure because any person who supposes that these	conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved- ever- reckons	without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human	assumption	these conditions are unobtainable- are not even approachable	in the qualified sense i have indicated- without the prior defeat	of world communism.	3.0606132166652493
14984. this is true for two reasons: because communism	is both doctrinally and in practice antithetical to these conditions;	and because communists have the will and as long as soviet	power remains intact the capacity to prevent their realization.	5.3075454336594445
14985. moreover	as communist power increases the enjoyment of these conditions	throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of	their restoration becomes increasingly remote.	3.2793541743378607
14986. it	follows that victory over communism is the dominant proximate goal	of american policy.	5.600212667620909
14987. proximate in the sense that there are more distant	more positive ends we seek to which victory over communism	is but a means.	4.04165311798173
14988. but dominant in the sense that every other objective	no matter how worthy intrinsically must defer to it.	5.731748277165949
14989. peace is a worthy	objective; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the	communists out of berlin then we must fight.	3.727166303082796
14990. freedom in the sense	of self-determination is a worthy objective; but if granting self-determination	to the algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into	the sino-soviet orbit then algerian freedom must be postponed.	4.772503831475466
14991. justice	is a worthy objective; but if justice for bantus entails driving	the government of the union of south africa away from the west	then the bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards	yet a while longer.	3.6415988526212693
14992. prosperity is a worthy objective; but if providing	higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient	guns to resist communist aggression then material sacrifices and	denials will have to be made.	5.5355724820496865
14993. it may be of course that such objectives	can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow communism;	my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be	resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant	world- the absence of soviet communist power.	3.5873627498783156
14994. power	this much having been said the question remains whether we	have the resources for the job we have to do- defeat communism-	and if so how those resources ought to be used.	5.254793651111801
14995. this brings us squarely	to the problem of power and the uses a nation makes of power.	4.343449818048815
14996. i submit that this is the key problem of international relations that	it always has been that it always will be.	6.8284566164613905
14997. and i suggest further	that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of	american policy-makers ever since we assumed free world leadership	in 1945 to deal with this problem realistically and seriously.	3.6649497054435236
14998. in the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting	the question of power and i think we might begin by trying to put them	into proper focus.	5.5901582291555485
14999. one was demonstrably false; the other for the	most part true.	4.520503764949333
15000. the first was that america had become- or	was in danger of becoming- a second-rate military power.	5.271788104913128
15001. i know i	do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention.	4.738873572885274
15002. you	may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment-	i certainly do- but you know any comparison of over-all american	strength with over-all soviet strength finds the united states	not only superior but so superior both in present weapons and in the	development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent	feature of us-soviet relations for the foreseeable future.	4.601683918580275
15003. i have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority	on those americans who have doubts and i think mr jameson	campaigne has done it well in his new book american might and soviet	myth.	3.398974553275656
15004. suppose he says that the tables were turned and we	were in the soviets' position: there would be more than 2000	modern soviet fighters all better than ours stationed at 250 bases	in mexico and the caribbean.	5.317344021510469
15005. overwhelming russian naval power would	always be within a few hundred miles of our coast.	4.037430902897831
15006. half of the population	of the us would be needed to work on arms just to feed	the people.	6.949549921984989
15007. add this to the unrest in the countries around us where	oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity.	4.104974867201761
15008. add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would	severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the soviets even in the	missile field which is reputed to be our main strength.	4.804873661852757
15009. if	we look at the situation this way we can get an idea of khrushchev's	nightmarish worries- or at least of the worries he might have if	his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage.	3.929944855460763
15010. the other charge was that america's political position	in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years.	5.360194719595174
15011. the	contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it	ever was during the campaign but once that has been done i fail to	see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it.	3.50238957326974
15012. the argument was typically advanced in terms of us prestige.	6.03934750254586
15013. prestige however is only a minor part of the problem; and	even then it is a concept that can be highly misleading.	4.974124123547105
15014. prestige	is a measure of how other people think of you well or ill.	6.1316503149587955
15015. but contrary	to what was implied during the campaign prestige is surely not important	for its own sake.	3.734477571195389
15016. only the vain and incurably sentimental among	us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed	by our strength as they ought to be.	5.225890130474753
15017. the thing to lose sleep over	is what people having concluded that we are weaker than we are are	likely to do about it.	3.646645648069513
15018. the evidence suggests that foreign peoples	believe the united states is weaker than the soviet union and	is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead.	5.617062767647505
15019. this ignorant	estimate i repeat is not of any interest in itself; but it becomes	very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically	do- namely by taking steps to end up on what appears to be	the winning side.	3.1901563631929046
15020. to the extent then that declining us prestige	means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on	an ultimate american defeat and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet	intimidation there is reason for concern.	5.160989143137
15021. still these guesses	about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the	actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves.	4.225466097956253
15022. here	i do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and	overwhelming but of political power- of influence if you will-	about which the relevant questions are: is soviet influence throughout	the world greater or less than it was ten years ago?	4.763929559176157
15023.  and is western	influence greater or less than it used to be?	4.504765502115107
15024. 	in answering these questions we need to ask not merely whether	communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy	before and not merely whether disciplined agents of the cominform	are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded:	the success of communism's war against the west does not depend	on such spectacular and definitive conquests.	4.767609173057707
15025. success may mean merely	the displacement of western influence.	4.355860713110899
15026. communist political	warfare we must remember is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages.	5.548589940717382
15027. fearful of inviting a military showdown with the west which they	could not win the communists seek to undermine western power where	the nuclear might of the west is irrelevant- in backwoods guerrilla	skirmishes	in mob uprisings in the streets in parliaments in clandestine	meetings of undercover conspirators at the united nations	on the propaganda front at diplomatic conferences- preferably at	the highest level.	3.0617985342366367
15028. the soviets understand moreover that the	first step in turning a country toward communism is to turn it against	the west.	4.757833467124851
15029. thus typically the first stage of a communist takeover	is to neutralize a country.	4.1352904122703995
15030. the second stage is to retain the	nominal classification of neutralist while in fact turning the	country into an active advocate and adherent of soviet policy.	4.815946511137365
15031. and	this may be as far as the process will go.	5.029506796750255
15032. the kremlin's goal is	the isolation and capture not of ghana but of the united states-	and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade	under a neutralist mask yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries	of the soviet foreign office.	4.601757279171734
15033. to recite the particulars of	recent soviet successes is hardly reassuring.	3.9255358659110353
15034. six years ago	french indochina though in troubie was in the western camp.	6.95722646883705
15035. today	northern vietnam is overtly communist; laos is teetering between	communism and pro-communist neutralism; cambodia is for all	practical purposes neutralist.	3.0740351510380513
15036. indonesia in the early days of	the republic leaned toward the west.	7.088398488724107
15037. today sukarno's government	is heavily besieged by avowed communists and for all of its neutralist	pretensions it is a firm ally of soviet policy.	4.069675037703958
15038. ceylon	has moved from a pro-western orientation to a neutralism openly	hostile to the west.	5.268814229886843
15039. in the middle east iraq syria and	egypt were a short while ago in the western camp.	4.511018477464299
15040. today the nasser	and kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the west are dependent	for their military power on soviet equipment and personnel;	in almost every particular follow the kremlin's foreign policy line.	4.968680750474608
15041. a short time ago all africa was a western preserve.	4.160374454653957
15042. never	mind whether the kikiyus and the bantus enjoyed wilsonian self-determination:	the point is that in the struggle for the world that	vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the west.	5.512961680488821
15043. today	africa is swerving violently away from the west and plunging	it would seem into the soviet orbit.	4.076576109168008
15044. latin america was once	an area as safe for the west as nebraska was for nixon.	5.513246832118078
15045. today	it is up for grabs.	4.942814736837273
15046. one latin american country cuba has become	a soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast.	5.460759427046692
15047. in some countries	the trend has gone further than others: mexico panama and venezuela	are displaying open sympathy for castroism and there is no country-	save the dominican republic whose funeral services we recently	arranged- where castroism and anti-americanism does not prevent	the government from unqualifiedly espousing the american cause.	3.130012573186037
15048. only in europe have our lines remained firm- and there only on the	surface.	6.202541175139262
15049. the strains of neutralism are running strong notably in	england and even in germany.	3.3500457052741237
15050. what have	we to show by way of counter-successes?	7.732090595438854
15051.  we have had opportunities-	clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the iron	curtain.	4.977528446168209
15052. there was the hungarian revolution which we praised	and mourned but did nothing about.	6.466498608298804
15053. there was the polish revolution	which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable	to soviet interests.	3.83315172007514
15054. there was the revolution in tibet which we pretended	did not exist.	7.164570137154735
15055. only in one instance have we moved purposively	and effectively to dislodge existing communist power: in guatemala.	3.7252629625764793
15056. and contrary to what has been said recently we did not wait for outside	pressures and world opinion to bring down that communist	government; we moved decisively to effect an anti-communist	coup	d'etat.	5.279774024801289
15057. we served our national interests and by so doing we	saved the guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery.	3.7913217762202223
15058. the first rattle of the machine guns at 7:10 in the evening	roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear.	4.9838346734666406
15059. sounds	exactly like last time.	4.951091895161587
15060. the young man spoke steadily enough	but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven.	6.018302493556015
15061. the middle-aged man	said over and over why did i come here why did i come	here.	3.6415850577492317
15062. amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons	i heard the thumping of mortars.	5.191017398645114
15063. then the lights went out.	6.018459515406504
15064. this was my	second day in vientiane the administrative capital of	laos and my thoughts were none too brave.	5.368139935216166
15065. where was my flashlight?	6.60593224186157
15066. 	where should i go?	7.0221452830349005
15067.  to my room?	7.02895681356735
15068.  better stay in the hotel lobby	where the walls looked good and thick.	6.32017294878251
15069. chinese and indian	merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters.	3.8032692152905665
15070. hotel	attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby.	6.0946882948737215
15071. a woman with a small	boy slipped in between them.	4.199237721020564
15072. she held out her hand to show that she had money.	7.534975761401679
15073. the american	newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office.	3.497161048846998
15074. but what	was the story?	8.15420150802021
15075.  had the communist-led pathet lao finally come this	far?	4.641401754191666
15076.  or was it another revolt inside vientiane?	7.449382125506313
15077.    let's	play hero i said.	4.946289741101507
15078. let's go to the roof and see.	7.561923208695374
15079. saves the moon	by 7:50 the answer was plain.	4.086064138509554
15080. there had	been an eclipse of the moon.	7.666555912026889
15081. a traditional lao explanation is that	the moon was being swallowed by a toad and the remedy was to make all	possible noise ideally with firearms.	3.2438380022482427
15082. the din was successful	too for just before the moon disappeared the frightened toad had	begun	to spit it out again which meant good luck all around.	4.474717265710047
15083. how	quaint it all seemed the next day.	4.393561915087577
15084. a restaurant posted a reminder to	patrons who became excited and left without paying their checks.	5.065614406327251
15085. but everyone i met had sought cover first and asked questions later.	3.8555313453706495
15086. and no wonder for vientiane the old city of sandalwood had	become the city of bullet holes.	5.953303204043368
15087. i saw holes in planes at the	airport and in cars in the streets.	4.0961105548849375
15088. along the main thoroughfares hardly	a house had not been peppered.	6.98021316256043
15089. in place of the police headquarters	was a new square filled with rubble.	4.316802680434152
15090. mortars had demolished the	defense ministry and set fire to the american embassy next door.	5.5980140878060185
15091. what	had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened	brick.	3.6950688236653035
15092. this damage had been done in the battle of vientiane	fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments	had ruled here in three days.	5.584909534724769
15093. and now in march	all laos suffered a state of siege.	4.831986749361677
15094. the pathet lao forces held	two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more.	4.986033469572912
15095. throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush	and death.	4.11634329244263
15096. and it's all the more tragic because it's	so little deserved said mr j j a frans a belgian	official of the united nations educational scientific and cultural	organization.	5.3910062997011385
15097. we talked after i hailed his jeep marked with	the u n flag.	3.793392065913214
15098. practically all the people of laos he	explained- about two million of them- are rice farmers and the means	and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel	plows.	5.086454002308276
15099. they look after their fields and children and water buffaloes	in ten or eleven thousand villages with an average of 200 souls.	3.814169387761679
15100. nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are.	6.329970623210945
15101. they spread	over an area no larger than oregon; yet they include peoples as different	from one another as oregonians are from patagonians.	3.2773027023681536
15102. must be kept in harmony	what matters here is family loyalty;	faith in the buddha and staying at peace with the phis the spirits;	and to live in harmony with nature.	5.348371301837661
15103. harmony in laos?	6.043687198532792
15104. 	precisely said mr frans.	7.0221452830349005
15105. he spoke of the season of	dryness and dust brought by the monsoon from the northeast in harmony	with the season of rain and mud brought by the monsoon from the southwest.	3.655179168299786
15106. the slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering	mekong river.	5.13003960336066
15107. shy slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with	the frangipani by the wayside.	3.676538742247546
15108. even life in harmony with death.	8.717809807136327
15109. for	so long as death was not violent it was natural and to be welcomed	making a funeral a feast.	3.726161721967949
15110. to many a frenchman- they came	95 years ago colonized and stayed until laos became independent in	1953- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than tahiti.	4.847539099826099
15111. yet laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen	around the globe.	4.6555940623123515
15112. the pathet lao stiffened by communist veterans	from neighboring north viet nam were supplied by soviet aircraft.	4.841002247138831
15113. the royal lao army on the other hand was paid and equipped with	american funds.	4.031205224308445
15114. in six years u s aid had amounted to more	than $1.	6.081954412255182
15115. 60 for each american- a total of three hundred million dollars.	4.5468191656076975
15116. we were there at a moment when the situation in laos threatened	to ignite another war among the world's giants.	6.244277739131413
15117. even if it	did not how would this little world of gentle people cope with its	new reality of grenades and submachine guns?	3.5518877546379186
15118.    to find out we	traveled throughout that part of laos still nominally controlled in	the daytime at least by the royal lao army: from attopeu the	city	of buffalo dung in the southeast to muong sing the city of	lions in the northwest close to communist china.	5.033827236183643
15119. we rode over roads so rough that our jeep came to rest atop the soil	between ruts all four wheels spinning uselessly.	3.295353267454273
15120. we flew in rickety	planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't crash.	5.493351144887043
15121. in the	end we ran into communist artillery fire.	4.185880329238569
15122. we were bill	garrett of the national geographic illustrations staff whose	three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any	fighting man we met; boun my our interpreter; and myself.	4.901718331091709
15123. boun my- the name means one who has a boun a celebration and	is therefore lucky- was born in savannakhet the border of paradise.	3.6713682741176252
15124. he had attended three universities in the united states.	8.423034636232694
15125. but	he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of vientiane	including the royal capital luang prabang.	3.836155222567571
15126. before the airplanes	came he said travel in laos was just about impossible.	6.822744220123756
15127. minister moves fast	alas so it almost proved for us too.	3.883495577061365
15128. to	go outside the few cities required permits.	6.448296593833941
15129. and getting them seemed	a life's work.	4.756266314196143
15130. nobody wanted americans to be hurt or captured and	few soldiers could be spared as escorts.	5.532854894653473
15131. we were told that to	the pathet lao a kidnaped american was worth at least $750 a fortune	in laos.	3.589381151081243
15132. everyone had heard of the american contractor who had	spurned an escort.	7.371704295895737
15133. now pathet lao propagandists were reported marching	him barefoot from village to village as evidence of evil american	intervention.	3.6138910959716535
15134. although we enjoyed our rounds of the government	offices in vientiane with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation	in french we were getting nowhere.	4.941479992584219
15135. we had nearly decided	that all the tales of lao lethargy must be true when we were invited	to take a trip with the prime minister.	3.6266955729653594
15136. could we be ready in 15	minutes?	7.607554216371273
15137.  his highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of	town and he was eager to be off.	4.078988392705683
15138. and	so after a flight southeast to savannakhet we found ourselves bouncing	along in a jeep right behind the land-rover of prince boun	oum of champassak a tall man of churchillian mien in a bush jacket	and a ten-gallon hat from texas.	4.353309954284433
15139. from his shoulder bag peeked the	seven-inch barrel of a luger.	4.397471204454515
15140. the temperature rose to 105`.	6.030629754548098
15141. with our company of soldiers we made one long column of reddish dust.	4.120803593540993
15142. in keng kok the city of silkworms the prime minister	bought fried chickens and fried cicadas and two notebooks for me.	5.016981267017055
15143. then we drove on until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice	fields bouncing across their squat earth walls.	3.9322059917968932
15144. it was a	spleen-crushing day.	8.44539401231157
15145. an hour of bouncing a brief stop in a village to	inspect a new school or dispensary.	4.067194851871392
15146. more bouncing another stop a	new house for teachers a new well.	6.229013607712588
15147. then off again rushing to keep up.	4.962070902912746
15148. but our two jeep mates- keo viphakone	from luang prabang and john cool from beaver pennsylvania-	were beaming under their coatings of dust.	4.68812054789959
15149. together they had probably	done more than any other men to help push laos toward the 20th century-	constructively.	4.074431809319109
15150. mr keo once a diplomat in paris and washington	was commissioner of rural affairs.	5.714225367363756
15151. john an engineer and anthropologist	with a doctorate from the london school of economics	headed the rural development division of usom the united states	operations mission administering us aid.	3.2079811317556417
15152. what	you see are self-help projects john said.	5.938534146905011
15153. we ask the people	what they want and they supply the labor.	4.255630233036344
15154. we send shovels cement	nails	and corrugated iron for roofs.	6.3027032635589455
15155. that way they have an infirmary	for $400.	5.83241622605377
15156. we have 2500 such projects and they add up to a lot more	than just roads and wells and schools.	5.7088953856379705
15157. mr	keo agreed.	6.235438618222183
15158. our people have been used to accepting things as	they found them he said.	6.371764490291739
15159. where there was no road they lived	without one.	5.539863294165306
15160. now they learn that men can change their surroundings	through their traditional village elders without violence.	5.733772765334118
15161. that's	a big step toward a modern state.	4.366785028639913
15162. you might say we are in the nation-building	business.	9.491316093271577
15163. in the villages people lined up to give	us flowers.	4.161899022670443
15164. then came coconuts eggs and rice wine.	7.2681192998500475
15165. the prime minister	paid his respects to the buddhist monks strode rapidly among the	houses joked with the local soldiery and made a speech.	3.2332249998236935
15166. the soldiers	are fighting and the americans are helping he said but in the	fight against the pathet lao the key factor is the villager himself.	5.039693113024695
15167. then we were off again.	6.155024878510955
15168. we did it for three days.	8.650366618487995
15169. but	our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery.	4.86051952477772
15170. crossing the 4000-foot	width of the mekong at champassak on a raft with an outboard	motor we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean	breeze.	4.699596738901725
15171. then we hung overboard in the water.	5.102059773231543
15172. briefly we rolled	over a paved road up to pak song on the cool bolovens plateau.	5.099111099547111
15173. the prince visited the hospital of operation brotherhood supported	by the junior chamber of commerce of the philippines and fed rice	to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at pak song.	2.9971046100590666
15174. keep souls in place	in the village of soukhouma which means	peaceful we had a baci.	5.811452779187281
15175. this is the most endearing of lao	ceremonies.	5.745020538153971
15176. it takes place in the household a rite of well-wishing	for myriad occasions- for the traveler a wedding a newborn child	the sick the new year for any good purpose.	5.593611759823166
15177. the preparations	were elaborate: flowers candles incense sticks rice wine dozens	of delicacies and pieces of white cotton string.	2.937440876713144
15178. the strings were	draped around flowers in tall silver bowls.	5.029001641763127
15179. the	candles were lighted and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village	notables.	3.6000004244937927
15180. i was careful to keep my feet the seat of the least worthy	spirits from pointing at anyone's head where the worthiest spirits	reside.	5.278503304010379
15181. now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to	come and join us.	4.0446688412352545
15182. next he addressed himself to our souls.	7.557641239926171
15183. a	man has 32 souls one for each part of the body.	4.49393829279899
15184. those souls like to	wander off and must be called back.	7.042946948323727
15185. with the divinities present	and our souls in place we were wished health happiness and power.	3.792565259021713
15186. then one after another the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings	around our wrists.	5.918889809177176
15187. these were to be kept on to hold in the 32 souls.	5.399757566865964
15188. as we stepped out into the sunlight a man came up to john	cool and silently showed him his hand.	6.051485656783095
15189. it had a festering hole as	big as a silver dollar.	4.480062610387953
15190. we could see maggots moving.	8.701753208931168
15191. john said:	i have some antiseptic salve with me but it's too late for	that.	3.912858278706474
15192. my interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening	of religious and ethnic bonds.	5.668928811577089
15193. jewish identity was often confused	with social and economic strivings.	4.395471196463935
15194. being jewish gives you tremendous	drive a boy remarked.	6.748512462831798
15195. it means that you have to get	ahead.	6.936735253622233
15196. when i pressed for a purely religious definition i encountered	the familiar blend of liberal piety interfaith good will and	a small residue of ethnic loyalty.	4.930378726836086
15197. i like the tradition	a girl said.	5.445157453952311
15198. i like to follow the holidays when they come along.	7.259418339012413
15199. but you don't have to worship in the traditional way.	4.950320237631077
15200. you can communicate	in your own way.	8.02253740752107
15201. as i see it there's no real difference between	being jewish catholic or protestant.	4.049380718887933
15202. another teen-ager	remarked: most jews don't believe in god but they believe	in people- in helping people.	5.411686612352407
15203. still another boy asserted:	to be a good jew is to do no wrong; it's to be a good person.	4.590678057457443
15204. when asked how this was different from being a good protestant	the boy answered it's the same thing.	6.106430207943702
15205. this accords	with the study by maier and spinrad.	4.100897288602324
15206. they discovered that although	42 per cent of a sample of catholic students and 15 per cent of the	protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings	of their religion only 8 per cent of the jewish students had this	conviction.	6.1511480861708785
15207. the most important aims of the jewish students were as	follows: to make the world a better place to live in- 30 per cent;	to get happiness for yourself- 28 per cent; and financial independence-	21 per cent.	3.6099611598034493
15208. nevertheless most of the teen-agers	i interviewed believed in maintaining their jewish identity and even	envisioned joining a synagogue or temple.	5.680044380150707
15209. however they were hostile	to jewish orthodoxy professing to believe in judaism but in a	moderate way.	3.732144717343695
15210. one boy said querulously about orthodox jews: it's	the twentieth century and they don't have to wear beards.	5.580119050608355
15211. the reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked	force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds.	3.595820185105886
15212. we were brought	up that way was one statement which won general assent.	6.239113550286745
15213. i	want to show respect for my parents' religion was the way in which	a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of judaism.	3.518739397380695
15214. still	another suggested that he would join a temple for social reasons	since i'll be living in a suburb.	5.723317462362942
15215. intermarriage which	is generally regarded as a threat to jewish survival was regarded not	with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild clinical disapproval.	3.669695084691348
15216. most of the teen-agers i interviewed rejected it on pragmatic	grounds.	7.081964457268119
15217. when you marry you want to have things in common a	girl said and it's hard when you don't marry someone with your	own background.	3.705436017736784
15218. a fourteen-year-old girl from the middle	west observed wryly that in her community religion inconveniently interfered	with religious activities- at least with the peripheral activities	that many middle class jews now regard as religious.	4.381845396181615
15219. it appears	that an orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing	sponsored by one of the jewish service groups because she would	not travel on saturday and in addition required kosher food.	3.8001604727021725
15220. another	girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as the	only orthodox girl in town.	5.185008639431086
15221. this is no doubt inaccurate	but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the	nonobservant.	3.9602225675054976
15222. one of the significant things about	jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented.	7.069076817728579
15223. sixty-five per cent of the jewish teen-agers of college	age attend institutions of higher learning.	4.228100888002789
15224. this is substantially higher	than the figures for the american population at large- 45.	6.361245880034661
15225. 6 per	cent for males and 29.	4.585211272896721
15226. 2 per cent for females.	10.316758835066318
15227. this may help explain	a phenomenon described by a small-town jewish boy.	4.23519085977876
15228. in their first two	years in high school jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions	to win positions on the school teams.	5.850585475297418
15229. however in their junior and	senior years they generally forego their athletic pursuits presumably	in the interest of better academic achievement.	3.710854691739627
15230. it is significant	too that the older teen-agers i interviewed believed unlike the	younger ones that jewish students tend to do better academically than	their gentile counterparts.	5.076005773583881
15231. the percentage of jewish girls	who attend college is almost as high as that of boys.	4.131533169180573
15232. the motivations	for both sexes to be sure are different.	5.933260498933101
15233. the vocational motive is	the dominant one for boys while jewish girls attend college for social	reasons and to become culturally developed.	3.063367835671698
15234. one of the significant	developments in american-jewish life is that the cultural consumers	are largely the women.	6.305327256040709
15235. it is they who read- and make- jewish	best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them.	3.7256795679497103
15236. in	upper teen jewish life the non-college group tends to have a sense	of marginality.	5.989484281775445
15237. people automatically assume that i'm in college	a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably.	3.8867099374988587
15238. however among	the girls there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going	to college.	6.311830654185827
15239. the jewish working girl almost invariably works in an	office- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers- and buttressed	by a respectable income she is likely to dress better and live	more expansively than the college student.	3.0348634724721455
15240. she is even prone to regard	the college girl as immature.	6.672706334322686
15241. one of the reasons for the high percentage of jewish teen-agers	in college is that a great many urban jews are enabled to attend	local colleges at modest cost.	4.16127771756555
15242. this is particularly true in large centers	of jewish population like new york chicago and philadelphia.	5.923263140815575
15243. what is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is	that although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their	gentile counterparts	they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed	jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-jewish	world.	3.342722018577396
15244. perhaps the jewish students at brooklyn college-	constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session- can	serve as a paradigm of the urban lower-middle class jewish student.	6.039161435135572
15245. there is to begin an important sex difference.	5.598036980494738
15246. typically in	a lower-middle class jewish family a son will be sent to an out-of-town	school if financial resources warrant it while the daughter will	attend the local college.	4.710869753721313
15247. there are two reasons for this.	5.691861405400822
15248. first	the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's.	5.978593990699701
15249. second	the attitude in jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter	than toward the son.	3.730344154401281
15250. most jewish mothers are determined to exercise	vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by	keeping them home.	5.779425991050461
15251. the consequence of this is that the girls at brooklyn	college outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically.	4.29593152512695
15252. one can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town.	7.479959123755944
15253. brooklyn college students have an ambivalent attitude toward their	school.	4.531616542501917
15254. on the one hand there is a sense of not having moved beyond	the ambiance of their high school.	7.042239412375818
15255. this is particularly acute for	those who attended midwood high school directly across the street	from brooklyn college.	3.936821552316082
15256. they have a sense of marginality at being denied	that special badge of status the out-of-town school.	6.171179564930523
15257. at the same	time there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good	college- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable	virtues- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling	that the college generates.	3.58567851662091
15258. it's people of your own kind a girl	remarked.	6.6094870227215035
15259. you don't have to watch what you say.	5.434047641834238
15260. of course	i would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds	of people but i would want lots of jewish kids there.	6.493654490391535
15261. for	most brooklyn college students college is at once a perpetuation	of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood	and family.	3.678373006263693
15262. rooklyn college is unequivocally jewish in	tone and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably	midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing.	4.779273779878495
15263. however a	growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by	courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly	critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents.	3.316359026979225
15264. and	the rebellion of these third generation jews is not the traditional	conflict of culture but rather a protest against a culture that they	view as softly and insidiously enveloping.	4.939033337203226
15265. as long as i'm home	i'll never grow up a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly.	4.0544899876307605
15266. they don't like it if i do anything away from home.	6.369906527903819
15267. it's so	much trouble i don't usually bother.	3.986711847962267
15268. for girls the overprotection	is far more pervasive.	6.864906238556623
15269. parents will drive on friday night	to pick up their daughters after a sorority or house plan meeting.	3.6538324508367395
15270. a freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean at brooklyn	college and demanded the low-down on a boy who was going out	with his daughter.	5.008221939864377
15271. the domestic tentacles even extend to the choice	of a major field.	3.397339261355978
15272. under pressure from parents the majority of brooklyn	college girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with	marriage plans- limited graduate study requirement and convenient	working hours.	5.0517594032039925
15273. this means that a great many academically talented girls	are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature.	4.192349193301816
15274. a kind of double standard exists here for jewish boys and girls	as it does in the realm of sex.	5.630682798173505
15275. the breaking away from the prison	house of brooklyn is gradual.	3.7710018555401197
15276. first the student trains on his	hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological	and sociological insights.	5.473140987027433
15277. then with the new affluence there is	actually a sallying forth into the wide wide world beyond the precincts	of new york.	3.6836384649057323
15278. it is significant that the catskills which used to	be the summer playground for older teen-agers a kind of summer suburb	of new york no longer attracts them in great numbers- except for	those who work there as waiters bus boys or counselors in the day	camps.	4.629024000407179
15279. the great world beyond beckons.	4.644934407624465
15280. but it should be pointed out	that some of the new watering places- fire island nantucket westhampton	long island for example- tend to be homogeneously jewish.	6.3648461057381445
15281. although brooklyn college does not yet have a junior-year-abroad	program a good number of students spend summers in europe.	3.7774005578009495
15282. in	general however the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that	of the student at harvard or smith.	5.352658506439744
15283. and acculturation into the world	at large is likely to occur for the brooklyn college student after	college rather than during the four school years.	3.6136357364636185
15284. brooklyn	college is marjorie morningstar territory as much as the bronx or	central park west.	5.829305538080986
15285. there are hordes of nubile young women there	who prodded by their impatient mothers are determined to marry.	3.52064209266342
15286. it is interesting that although the percentage of married students	is not appreciably higher at brooklyn than elsewhere- about 30 per	cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class-	the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate.	5.4499952700310015
15287. almost	everybody in the senior class is married students say dogmatically.	3.925028376875427
15288. and the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities sororities	and houses that have good	news to impart.	5.364999305861259
15289. these announcements are in effect advertisements	for themselves as thriving marriage marts.	3.926400770643343
15290. there are boxed proclamations	in the newspaper of watchings pinnings ringings engagements and	marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity.	4.847648899333456
15291. witt house	happily announces the engagement of fran horowitz to erwin schwartz	of fife house.	3.2884772608511885
15292. the brooklyn college student shows	some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models.	4.8640139186439075
15293. the ivy	league enjoys no easy dominion here and the boys are as likely to	dress in rather foppish continental fashion or even in nondescript	working class manner as they are in the restrained button-down ivy	way.	3.409755509781044
15294. the girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts	out of town and eye shadow mascara and elaborate bouffant	hairdos- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel-	are not unknown even in early morning classes.	4.48034559937029
15295. among the	boys there is very little bravado about drinking.	4.737595822276965
15296. brooklyn college	is distinctive for not having an official drinking place.	6.004414726875596
15297. the fort lauderdale	encampment for drinking is foreign to most brooklyn college	boys.	3.3590488903637774
15298. this should be used frequently.	9.170287898511418
15299. for galled	breasts the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard	enough white chalk to make a paste.	3.7752536119516464
15300. this could also be used for any	other skin irritation.	7.07846825321661
15301. or she might place cornstarch in the oven for	a short time and then apply this under her breasts.	3.9296653137485054
15302. female	troubles of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the	frontier; at least i have only one remedy for anything of this kind	in my collection one for hastening delayed menstruation.	5.226276274684679
15303. the sufferer	drinks tansy tea.	3.9106505214963643
15304. bruises burns cuts etc occurred frequently	on the frontier and folk medicine gave the answers to these	problems too.	5.281996132503266
15305. bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of	raw beefsteak.	4.049265991465746
15306. salted butter was	another	cure for bruises.	6.766554662704757
15307. many people agreed that burns should be treated	with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard but one informant	told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water; the burn oozed	watery fluid for many days and finally the healing was completed by	bathing it with epsom salts.	3.0656210660674335
15308. another swore by vinegar baths for burns	and still another recommended salted butter.	5.4481441037664515
15309. butter salve or	butter ointment was used for burns and for bruises as well.	3.8735468053506548
15310. this	was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil;	when it was cool the fat was skimmed off and bottled.	5.224197246668217
15311. cow's	milk was another cure for burns and burns covered with gum arabic or	plain mucilage healed quickly.	3.4268885811707337
15312. one man badly burned about the face and	eyes by an arc welding torch was blinded and could not find a doctor	at the time.	5.30720975993638
15313. a sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings	which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the heat.	3.4323748722843037
15314. later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns.	6.854332829482307
15315. the results	were good but which treatment helped is still not known.	3.5283625882590948
15316. to	stop bleeding cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds.	5.713879512754054
15317. one old-timer	said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut even when on a knuckle if it	was made by a rusty tool; this would stop the flow and also prevent	infection.	3.4164846334026397
15318. my lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy	for cuts and wounds; she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury	and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth over which she poured	turpentine.	4.7616750601443
15319. he showed me one of his fingers which had been practically	amputated and which his mother had treated; there is scarcely a scar	showing.	3.961914496772278
15320. tobacco was common first aid.	6.880412933344048
15321. a chaw of tobacco put	on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing.	3.4714628842645774
15322. or a thin slice	of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing.	5.928594122753334
15323. one	old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a	fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his	head.	3.8199247716174263
15324. his brother ran a mile to get the father; when they reached	the boy the father sliced a new plug of tobacco put the scalp back	in place and covered the raw edges with the slices.	4.917054009855225
15325. then he put a rag	around the dressing to keep it in place.	4.888743473206735
15326. there was no cleaning or further	care but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no	scar.	6.04136336535842
15327. veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding	and rue was an antiseptic.	3.8305869953219354
15328. until quite recently sterile maggots	could be bought to apply to a wound; they would feed on its surface	leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated.	5.5475020478813075
15329. tetanus	could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound.	3.8426718236398685

15334. another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds	then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker.	5.471246944611803
15335. while nowadays	we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at	the nose not long ago a nosebleed was simply that and treatment had	little	variation.	4.213525010071489
15336. since a fall or blow might have caused it a cold pack	was usually first aid.	5.604137911281678
15337. this might be applied to the top of the nose	or the back of the neck pressed on the upper lip or inserted into the	nostril.	4.515237790282173
15338. nosebleed could be	stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient's neck and	tying in it a knot for each year of his life.	4.849612334369998
15339. or the victim could chew	hard on a piece of paper meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in	his ears.	4.1012311299445505
15340. old sores could be healed by the constant application	of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water.	5.343647118517518
15341. blood blisters could	be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with	any hard nonpoisonous substance.	3.247142737443795
15342. felons were cured by taking common	salt and drying it in the oven pounding it fine and mixing it with equal	parts of spirits of turpentine; this mixture was then spread on	a cloth and wrapped around the affected part.	4.8684386246821205
15343. as the cloth dried more	of the mixture was applied and after twenty-four hours the felon was	supposed to be killed.	3.600551852224746
15344. insect bites were cured in many	ways.	6.737264959005488
15345. many an old-timer swore by the saliva method; get a bite	spit on it was a proverb.	4.125898657485777
15346. this was used also for bruises.	8.169742291666292
15347. yellow	clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings;	not long ago denver mud was most popular.	3.709890844007406
15348. chiggers were a	common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived; so	small as to be scarcely visible to the eye they buried themselves in	the victim's flesh.	4.644261875888863
15349. bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief	and also killed the pests.	3.540118645056104

15354. just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve	wasp or bee stings.	6.361830750763861

15358. at times pioneer children got lice in their	hair.	7.019103612813838
15359. a kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment but it did the	job.	3.9901754769345295

15361. a cinder or other small object could be removed from the	eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye.	3.378192221099297
15362. as the seed swelled its glutinous	covering protected the eyeball from irritation and both the cinder	and the seed could soon be washed out.	5.015143164676345
15363. another way to remove small	objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed; the particle	would then move toward the nose where it could be wiped out with	a wisp of cotton.	3.6039462690703417
15364. shingles were cured by gentian an old drug	used in combinations.	5.740818936332996
15365. for erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and	one	ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth.	3.6375598420758815

15368. to cure fungus growths	on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of	sassafras bark in a quart of water.	4.948445769896883

15372. now one hears that	heat and hot water are used instead.	6.391428473785135
15373. another remedy was oil of eucalyptus	used as well for chilblains.	4.323475933233158
15374. chilblains were also treated with	tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves.	5.405684168477695
15375. boils have always been	a source of much trouble.	4.190598043042248
15376. a german informant gave me a sure cure	made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice.	4.972593859105199
15377. another poultice	was made from the inner bark of the elm tree steeped in water	until it formed a sticky gummy solution.	3.4633765339237024
15378. this was also used for sores.	9.339336831688017
15379. another frequent pioneer difficulty caused by wearing rough and heavy	shoes and boots was corns.	3.51801238403089
15380. one veracious woman tells me she has	used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they	remove the pain or fire.	4.731994034662397
15381. another common cure was to soak the	feet five or ten minutes in warm water then to apply a solution of	equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight.	3.3262008894044337
15382. this softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed	the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on.	5.640277438551651
15383. there were many cures for warts.	5.701544802916987
15384. one young girl told me how her	mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in	vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several	times.	4.926088450698359
15385. another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a	bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the	house for seven days.	3.2771400109417406
15386. saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's	sleep was considered poisonous; wetting a wart with this saliva on	wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear	after only a few treatments and strangely enough many warts did	just that.	5.031782845911738
15387. one wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy.	4.238966618365083
15388. another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours tie	it on the wart and wear it for a week.	5.497419259162108
15389. a simpler method was to tie	a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way.	3.5154964806401416
15390. one person recommended to me washing the wart with	sulphur water; another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato	three times daily.	5.4337764957120225
15391. another common method was to cut an onion in two and	place each half on the wart for a moment; the onion was then fastened	together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave.	3.3402568784227467
15392. as the	onion decayed so did the wart.	7.016501728167982
15393. sore muscles were relieved by	an arnica rub; sore feet by calf's-foot an herb from the pioneer's	ubiquitous herb garden or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water	in which two cups of salt had been dissolved.	2.953821346873411
15394. leg cramps one person	tells me were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the	body on the heel and pressing down hard.	5.106107461816358
15395. this does give relief as i	can testify.	4.5895451080791725
15396. one doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy	before each meal for leg cramps.	5.3583808554287415
15397. pains in the back of the leg and in	the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope	about the patient's waist.	3.6657752002177033
15398. for sprains and swellings one	pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added	to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief.	5.036565718895132
15399. except for the wine waiter in a restaurant- always an inscrutable	plenipotentiary unto himself the genii with the keys to unlock	the gates of the wine world are one's dealer and the foreign shipper	or negociant who in turn supplies him.	3.1300461483002575
15400. in instances where	both of these are persons or firms with integrity the situation is ideal.	5.885450190624282
15401. it may on occasion be anything but that.	5.126523030690678
15402. however by cultivating	a wine dealer and accepting his advice one will soon enough ascertain	whether he has any knowledge of wines	and better yet whether he	has a taste for wine.	4.878635467996016
15403. again by spreading one's purchases over several	wine dealers one becomes familiar with the names and specialties	of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad.	3.4287168428458448
15404. this is important because	despite all the efforts of the french government an appreciable	segment of france's export trade in wines is still tainted with a	misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty and there are many	too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a	creditable reputation overseas.	4.747091955318595
15405. a good negociant or shipper	will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from	the best vineyards or the best parts of them; he may also be the	one who makes and bottles the best blends- sound wines from vineyards	generally in his own district.	3.2774283176461836
15406. these are the wines the french themselves	use for everyday drinking for even in france virtually no one	drinks the grands crus on a meal-to-meal basis.	5.123413192491559
15407. the grands	crus are expensive and even doting palates tire of them.	3.2227716387407965
15408. and certainly	in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine	drinker the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready	for the grands crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse	to crus of less renown.	5.0481115496327496
15409. there is nothing infra dig about a	good blend from a good shipper.	4.536674028014359
15410. some of them are very delicious indeed	and there are many good ones exported- unfortunately along with	others not so good and worse.	6.2543434691995
15411. consultation with a reputable wine dealer	and constant experimentation- steering ever from the known to	the unknown- are the requisites.	3.353195635173351
15412. wine waiters are something	else again; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great	deal their importance mounts.	5.168968702126477
15413. most of them the world over operate	on the same principle by which justice is administered in france and	some other latin countries: the customer is to be considered guilty	of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise with the burden of proof	on the customer himself.	3.5286592195222037
15414. now the drinking of wine	is for the most part a recondite affair for manifestly if everyone	in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them the	supply would dry up in no time at all.	5.11921943211362
15415. this is the only valid and extenuating	argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible	attitude of the common wine waiter.	4.237023099595537
15416. a really good wine waiter is	paradoxically the guardian of his cellar against	the visigoths.	5.342164348303958
15417. faced on the one hand with an always exhaustible	supply of his best wines and on the other by a clientele usually equipped	with inexhaustible pocketbooks it is a wonder indeed that all wine	waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence.	3.790590145616654
15418. the one way to	get around them- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking	to it- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter	is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending	money.	4.80653157687486
15419. only then perhaps will he reveal his jewels and his bargains.	4.232996876001275
15420. wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest	for several weeks before it is served.	6.089772873614738
15421. this is especially true of	red wines and a practice which though not always practicable is well	worth the effort.	3.6489128492678655
15422. it does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter	of days but in terms of months and years it is fatal.	5.932979238699473
15423. wine stored	for a long time should be on its side; otherwise the cork dries	and air enters to spoil it.	3.785090596585804
15424. when stacking wine on its side in a bin	care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next	to the cork.	6.407516774048027
15425. fat bottles such as burgundies have a way of rolling	around in the bin and often need little props such as a bit of cardboard	or a chip of wood to hold them in the proper reclining posture.	3.713208599658834
15426. too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks again with ill effects.	6.189963672510851
15427. the best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine	is to smell the wet end of the cork after	pulling it: if it smells of wine the bottle is probably all right;	if it smells of cork one has grounds for suspicion.	3.224970166334959
15428. seasonal	rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine: they age it prematurely.	5.182958278171667
15429. the ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five	degrees with an allowable range of five degrees above or below	this provided there are no sudden or frequent changes.	3.159445737139519
15430. prolonged vibration	is also undesirable; consequently one's wine closet or cellar	should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces.	4.578167709070222
15431. if	one lives near a subway or an express parkway the solution is to have	one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time.	3.316327648619022
15432. light especially daylight is always bad for wine.	6.496869929792201
15433. all in	all though there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations	thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking; many people go	to extreme lengths in decanting chilling or warming or banishing without	further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious	cork.	3.4133502019235147
15434. no one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure	they derive from all this and to give fair warning where warning	is due no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree	of purism! but the fact remains that in most restaurants including	some of the best of paris and bordeaux and dijon the bottle	is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered	and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place	while the chef is preparing the meal.	4.6761119159239435
15435. a white wine already at cool	cellar temperature may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and	water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator	in about fifteen minutes; for those who live in a winter	climate there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow.	3.472932160700087
15436. though	by no means an ideal procedure a red wine may similarly be brought	from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so	before serving time.	5.081104147982709
15437. it may be a bit cold when poured; but again	as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt wine should	be served in a large tulip-shaped glass which is never filled more	than half full.	3.4701395654341374
15438. in this way red wine warms of itself quite rapidly-	and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste	and fragrance until after the middle of the meal in	the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting	stages.	5.721426438214127
15439. the only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming	a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an	open fire.	3.8044377128786215
15440. this invariably effaces any wine's character and drives	its fragrance underground.	5.404059247478897
15441. it should not be forgotten that	wines mature fastest in half-bottles less fast in full bottles slowly	in magnums- and slower yet in tregnums double magnums jeroboams	methuselahs and imperiales respectively.	3.3180804078701653
15442. very old red wines	often require several hours of aeration and any red wine brought from	the cellar within half an hour of mealtime should be uncorked and allowed	some air.	5.019497979167233
15443. but white wines never! white wines should be opened	when served having been previously chilled in proportion to their	sweetness.	3.507476508172271
15444. thus sauternes or barsacs should be very cold; a pouilly-fuisse	or a chablis somewhat less cold.	5.267637228675293
15445. over-chilling is an accepted	method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white	wine especially a dry wine- and certainly less of a crime than serving	a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive.	3.0535211445623247
15446. the fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death	when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air.	4.709134173968681
15447. to quote	professor saintsbury: the last glass of claret or burgundy	is as good as the first; but the first glass of chateau d'yquem	or montrachet is a great deal better than the last! this does not	mean though that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration: there	is a reasonable limit- and wines kept over to the next meal or	the next day after they have once been opened are never as good.	3.3044386387205553
15448. if	this must be done they should always be corked and kept in a cool place;	it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably	shorter than those of milk.	5.370386390130379
15449. a few red wines notably those	of the beaujolais are better consumed at cellar temperature.	3.6684763673716536
15450. by	tradition a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature-	if anything a little cooler- and be aged enough for the tannin	and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well.	4.909984805745861
15451. thus	red wine must if possible never be disturbed or shaken; very old	red wine is often decanted so that the puckering bitter elements which	have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself.	3.328022283969501
15452. a tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may	do as much harm as a week at sea.	4.984841410623213
15453. the cork should be pulled gradually	and smoothly and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward.	3.3174571825024954
15454. many	people use wicker cradles for old red wine lifting the bottle carefully	from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table without	disturbing the sediment.	5.003235748269755
15455. another school frowns on such a shortcut and	insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand	on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom	after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position	on its side in the cradle.	3.3144187971601005
15456. in france when one wishes to entertain	at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines one visits the	restaurant well ahead of time chooses the wines and with the advice	of the manager and his chef builds the menu around them.	5.008863036223412
15457. the wine	waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened	at least in time to warm and aerate preferably allowed to stand on	end for as long as possible and perhaps in the case of very old wines	be decanted.	3.530518719474757
15458. decanting old wine aerates it fully; it may also be-	practically speaking- a matter of good economy.	5.626492482584624
15459. for in the process	of decanting the bottle is only tilted once instead of several	or more times at the table: hence a minimum of the undesirable mixture	of wine and dregs.	3.4743543293984605
15460. though there are many exceptions which	we have noted in preceding pages white wine is as a rule best consumed	between two and six years old and red wines nowadays between three	and ten.	5.4418252361961015
15461. red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep	longer; the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite	number red burgundy.	3.3190259624176943
15462. some clarets do not come into their own until	they are ten or fifteen years of age or even more.	5.906872439593482
15463. if a red bordeaux	of a good name and year is bitter or acid or cloying and muddy-tasting	leave it alone for a while.	3.5124145673223808
15464. most of the wines of beaujolais on	the other hand should be drunk while very young; and alsatians	may be.	5.775183175644224
15465. giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically: rest assured that	your accompanying letter of instructions shall be in the letter	and spirit strictly complied with h and most particularly in regard	to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane	views.	3.360783550520865
15466. giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation.	6.9810125125050835
15467. the slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under john palfrey's	overseer.	4.213504183742124
15468. an excellent crop was expected that year.	7.746795235075987
15469. william	who lived in neighboring st mary's parish had taken charge and	decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated	for another year.	3.7141664041990543
15470. giffen advised acceptance of this plan citing the	depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions	at the plantation.	5.273518243759973
15471. if sold then the land and improvements might	bring only $5000.	4.455810606303588
15472. early in january 1844 he had a conference with	henry and william in new orleans and upon learning of gorham's	intention henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother.	5.488739391824771
15473. the emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs	he contended but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless	negroes.	3.736988491593059
15474. they were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation	and louisiana law required their removal from the state.	5.4600022359796645
15475. gorham	refused to accept money for slave property but did he realize how	much expense and trouble the transportation of his negroes to the	north involved?	3.322889279793025
15476.  the suggestion that giffen hire out the slaves was	not realistic since no planter would take the risk of having negroes	who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves.	5.364130069902268
15477. henry hid	his annoyance although both he and william were furious with their	yankee brother.	3.848432822440647
15478. william who did not write to gorham told giffen	that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year he would	sue amicably to protect his interests.	5.637843278084288
15479. palfrey was	determined	that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers	during the transition period before emancipation.	4.192551547956272
15480. if william wished	to continue operations for a year why not simply leave the negroes	undisturbed and pay them as high wages to remain there as are ever	paid the labor of persons of their sex + age.	5.062805502776953
15481. a disposition to exert	themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them	h to come into the scheme.	3.5511956108590184
15482. their having family ties on our plantation	+ the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement.	6.272918566414503
15483. when he heard	of his brothers' anger palfrey was still hopeful that they could	be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages.	3.6041881089493617
15484. if not he was willing	to accede to william's wishes in any way that did not block	his ultimate aim.	5.721490807698482
15485. william was adamant on one point: under no circumstances	would he allow the negroes to remain on the plantation with his	and henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom.	3.4910768170566775
15486. knowing	the antipathy that existed in louisiana against increasing the	number of free negroes giffen suggested that palfrey bring them	to boston at once and then send them on to liberia.	4.796473350627029
15487. lacking specific	instructions he agreed to william's condition.	4.659976540925971
15488. in march	there was a division of the slaves and giffen carried out his instructions	as nearly as possible.	5.766446145480097
15489. of the fifty-two slaves giffen succeeded	in getting a lot of twenty twelve of whom were females.	4.392096600623622
15490. i considered	that your views would be best carried out he explained	by taking women whose progeny will of course be free + more fully extend	the philantrophy of emancipation.	4.94327348130131
15491. i have also taken the old servants	of your father as a matter of conscience + justice.	4.352905793718449
15492. the ages	of the slaves ranged from sixty-five for an old house servant to	an unnamed newborn child.	4.579892839206584
15493. if palfrey ever had any doubts about the	wickedness of slavery they were put aside after he received an inventory	of the slave property he had inherited.	3.553432904750206
15494. this cold reckoning of human	worth in a legal paper devoid of compassion or humanity was all	he needed.	4.941573213669669
15495. each human being known only by a given name had a cash value.	4.080935826329548
15496. old sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150;	rose a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential was worth $400.	4.9534846450017
15497. in rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property palfrey	was giving up close to $7000.	4.181258974175148
15498. palfrey's brothers each received	lots of sixteen negroes and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed	that all lots were to be valued at $6666.	5.112940009721441
15499. thus twenty black	souls were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land	of free men.	3.7002159221096163
15500. giffen extracted one concession from william: the house	servants could be free at any time gorham thought expedient.	5.498511996235474
15501. despite giffen's warning palfrey still had plans for freeing	his slaves in louisiana.	3.952060696346963
15502. yet even if he could get the necessary approval	fourteen of his negroes could not be manumitted without special	permission.	6.532030340085189
15503. according to state law a slave had to be at least thirty	years old before he could be freed.	4.84518982067225
15504. palfrey petitioned the state legislature	to waive the requirement.	6.666177651823738
15505. otherwise freedom would mean removal	from the state in which as the place of their past residence from	birth or for many years it would h be materially for their advantage	to be at liberty to remain.	3.7916646370754066
15506. on march 11 the louisiana legislature	voted unanimously to table the petition.	6.496631967677088
15507. news of the legislative	veto appeared in the new orleans papers and henry and william	became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt	in advance.	4.474986091890322
15508. henry stormed into giffen's office waving a copy of	the new orleans courier shouting that the emancipation scheme	had become a public affair and that it would reach the ears of the	people on the plantation and make them restless + unhappy.	5.256211046365109
15509. his brothers' anger caused palfrey genuine concern for he had	imposed a dual mission upon himself: to free his slaves and to keep	the family from falling apart over the issue.	3.1112755812904402
15510. when giffen decided	to charge him interest on the loan from john palfrey gorham readily	assented vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents his brothers	would never have any cause to complain of him.	5.4386591811978455
15511. in view of these	difficulties palfrey decided to go to louisiana.	5.260970681703099
15512. giffen had already	urged him to journey south if only for a few days to clear up matters.	6.577129686407469
15513. his duties as massachusetts secretary of state obliged him	to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-april.	4.0098616814119925
15514. palfrey	told his wife of his intentions for the first time and left for new	orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of providence	that he might be allowed to see his family again.	5.76477728920497
15515. during his journey	palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists.	4.709871967955767
15516. in both cases he	desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived	in the north.	5.466500078372089
15517. in new york lydia maria child welcomed him	enthusiastically: i have lately heard of you from the legislature	of louisiana and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood	of man.	3.4128949534595727
15518. mrs child who had once apologized for sending	editor palfrey a book on slavery now confided that she had helped one	of henry palfrey's slaves escape to canada some years before	but asked him not to advertise the fact in louisiana.	4.887978191241801
15519. she agreed to	take charge of five or six of the negroes should palfrey decide to send	them north immediately.	3.8367879746052376
15520. at lexington kentucky palfrey consulted	with cassius m clay on the same subject but with no apparent	result.	5.859251348818615
15521. despite his apprehensions about his personal safety	palfrey's reception in new orleans was more than cordial.	4.463755741619028
15522. instead	of the expected annoyances due to the nature of his mission	he received many calling cards and invitations from gentlemen of mark	on whom i had no sort of claim + have had many more invitations	than i could accept.	4.9329515009906135
15523. he later told abolitionist edmund quincy of	the marked attention and civility with which the new orleans	gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him.	3.471311844698104
15524. the memory of this southern	hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years	and civil war.	4.972231847318896
15525. palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic	account of two perilous days spent among the planters of attakapas	many of whom were coarse + passionate people much excited by what	they heard of my plans.	3.052448257300136
15526. he proceeded with his task bravely- in	his memoirs at least- before the passions of my neighbors should	have time to boil too high.	4.781424655953801
15527. palfrey had already made up his	mind that he would allow the men but not the women to choose freely	whether or not to go north for freedom.	4.088013029429032
15528. the women by remaining behind	condemned their children born and unborn to bondage.	5.145811185116255
15529. he had a	short private talk with each adult slave.	4.539694376894757
15530. only one objected but palfrey	soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others.	6.3199497016638
15531. all the	slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure	until the end of the planting season so that they could get in their	own little produce.	4.173262864376011
15532. palfrey agreed; the slaves were to remain	as wage laborers for his account.	5.974659813204728
15533. william's threat that under	no conditions would he allow freedom-conscious slaves to mix with	his own was not carried out for the plantation continued in operation	as before.	3.1765578563104095
15534. palfrey returned to massachusetts greatly relieved to	have made an arrangement so satisfactory to my judgment + my conscience.	5.19765079307401
15535. from cambridge palfrey maintained a close interest	in the welfare of his slaves.	4.410443770725189
15536. in fact as the time for their departure	approached his solicitousness increased.	6.894341083519148
15537. should any slave change	his mind and request to leave earlier giffen was to provide passage	at once.	3.7858006640159587
15538. when a sailing date of march 1845 was finally	established	palfrey made sure that the negroes would have comfortable quarters	in new orleans and aboard ship.	5.609049886504401
15539. giffen assured him that the captain	and his mate had personally promised to treat the negroes with consideration.	3.770331579177859
15540. palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage	to pay for their labor throughout 1844.	6.358265535848731
15541. the plantation was sold in january	1845 and palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people	two months' wages.	3.3352809152137666
15542. giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation	for a year's work; the new owner at attakapas declined to	enter into any philanthropic arrangement.	4.844227625221443
15543. on march 21 1845 the	bark bashaw weighed anchor at new orleans while on the levee	henry and william palfrey waved farewell to their father's former	chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled	regret and jubilation.	3.346240509570199

15581. nonetheless they	found common interests.	5.409845359165369
15582. during last year's campaign kennedy asked	walton an utter novice in organization politics to assist him.	5.519319040767463
15583. walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the	hard-fought wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted	to be liaison officer to critically important new york city.	3.4280015283490872
15584. walton who served as a correspondent with general james gavin's	paratroopers during the invasion of france combines the soul	of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy.	4.92607076442681

15588. a man of great talent he will continue	to serve as a sort of presidential trouble-shooter strictly ex	officio for culture.	6.302938815119345
15589. a more official representative is the secretary	of the interior.	4.203740767076673
15590. udall who comes from one of the mormon	first-families of arizona is a bluff plain-spoken man with a lust	for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight.	5.75423754815746
15591. but even while sparring furiously with republican politicians he displays	a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments.	3.47574682737164

15594. after promoting frost's	appearance at the inauguration he persuaded the poet to return	several months later to give a reading to a select audience of cabinet	members members of congress and other washington notables gathered	in the state department auditorium.	5.077966964882458
15595. the event was so successful	that the interior secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar	ones from time to time hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment	of the administration.	3.427159919521673
15596. his ideas in this respect however	sometimes arouse critical response.	6.608909436383133
15597. one tempest was stirred up last	march when udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue	of william jennings bryan sculpted by the late gutzon borglum	would be sent on indefinite loan to salem illinois bryan's	birthplace.	3.095208872716806
15598. spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors	promptly claimed that udall was exiling the statue because of his	own hostility to this art form.	4.656820470068927
15599. they dug up a speech he had made two	years earlier as a congressman decrying the more than two hundred	statues monuments and memorials which dot the washington landscape	h as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching	new plans.	3.2018008864934866
15600. hoping to cut down on such works udall had proposed	that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized.	5.537257263298238
15601. he is not likely to win this battle easily.	5.487117469962412

15605. the hotly debated plan for the capital's franklin	d roosevelt memorial a circle of huge tablets engraved with	his speeches	is another of udall's headaches since as supervisor	of the national parks commission he will share in the responsibility	for building it.	2.981171578133601
15606. washington president kennedy	has been heard to remark ironically is a city of southern efficiency	and northern charm.	5.82407061618936
15607. there have been indications that he hopes	to redress that situation commencing with the white house.	4.310995435832332
15608. one of	mrs kennedy's initial concerns as first lady was the sad state	of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national	shrine.	5.7582021417356115
15609. ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture	assembled by president thomas jefferson the white house has collected	a hodgepodge of period pieces few of them authentic or aesthetic.	3.6774047214817984
15610. mrs kennedy shows a determination to change all this.	6.783020652366522
15611. not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk hewed from	the timbers of the british ship hms resolute and	presented to	president hayes by queen victoria.	3.3565738985334135
15612. it now serves the president	in his oval office.	7.08891339366038
15613. later browsing in an old issue of the	gazette des beaux-arts she found a description of a handsome gilt	pier-table purchased in 1817 by president james monroe.	3.4748927313400535
15614. she traced	it to a storage room.	7.284792370724215
15615. with its coating of gold radiator paint removed-	a gaucherie of some earlier tenant- it will now occupy its	rightful place in the oval blue room on the first floor of the white	house.	3.719423269402113
15616. but it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century	furniture	for	must be pursued in places other than government storage	rooms.	6.161587674494043
15617. the first lady appointed a fine arts advisory committee	for the white house to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange	ways to acquire them.	4.064928740316283
15618. her effort to put the home of living presidents	on the same basis as mount vernon and monticello recognizes	no party lines.	5.778286311280883
15619. by rough estimate her committee headed by henry	francis du pont contains three times as many republicans as democrats.	3.7723805262667085
15620. the press releases emanating from the white house give	a clue to the activity within.	5.526556023596043

15625. and part of a fabulous collection of vermeil hollowware	bequeathed to the white house by the late mrs margaret	thompson biddle has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display	in the state dining room.	3.817004441243414
15626. woman's place is in the home:	man must attend to matters of the yard.	6.131250980079905
15627. one of the vexatious problems	to first confront president kennedy was the property lying just	across pennsylvania avenue from the white house.	3.795585472295431
15628. congress had	already appropriated money and plans were well along to tear down the	buildings flanking lafayette square and replace them with what one	critic calls the marble monumentality of government office buildings.	4.629110549814391
15629. while a senator kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to	preserve the belasco theater as well as the dolley madison and the	benjamin taylor houses all scheduled for razing.	3.6224217928855875
15630. what to	do about it now that he was president?	8.591183497375201
15631.  only a few days after moving	into the white house.	5.868225433277109
15632. kennedy made a midnight inspection of the square.	7.460385448516798
15633. then he called in his friend walton and turned over the problem	to him with instructions to work out what was best- provided it	didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the president.	3.5128181893964525
15634. the situation	involved some political perils.	5.600516718661201
15635. one of the offices slated for reconstruction	is the aged court of claims diagonally across the street	from the white house.	3.671971640936072
15636. logically it should be moved downtown.	8.074080161524199
15637. but	judge marvin jones senior member of the court is an elderly	gentleman who lives at the nearby metropolitan club and desires to walk	to work.	3.664605048104777
15638. more importantly he also happens to be the brother-in-law	of sam rayburn speaker of the house.	6.847681238350704
15639. there were aesthetic	problems as well as political.	6.3176488106573405
15640. on delving deeper walton discovered	that most of the buildings fronting the square could be classified	as early nondescript.	6.146838859815596
15641. the old belasco theater over which many	people had grown sentimental was only a shell of its former self	after arduous years as a uso center.	3.1711168165082353
15642. the dolley madison house	walton concluded was scarcely worth preserving.	5.059882034218906
15643. the attempt	to save the square's historic value he declares came half a	century too late.	3.133965308182498
15644. surrounded by ancient elms the campus is spacious and beautiful.	5.5080260112686386
15645. the	buildings are mostly georgian.	5.046763095927832
15646. the dartmouth student does not live	in monastic seclusion as he once did.	5.097299912051028
15647. but his is still a simple life	relatively free of the female presence or influence and he must go	far even though he may go fast for sophisticated pleasures.	3.8145053772007755
15648. he is	still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence if he chooses to be.	5.392642060075567
15649. he is by no means the country boy he might have been in the	last century down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal	for book learning in his heart.	4.069466545821774
15650. the men's shops on hanover's	main street compare favorably with those in princeton and new haven.	4.678126393660523
15651. and the automobiles that stream out of hanover each weekend	toward smith and wellesley and mount holyoke are no less rakish than	those leaving cambridge or west philadelphia.	3.2014464231473654
15652. but there has	always been an outdoor air to dartmouth.	7.032234416290097
15653. the would-be sophisticate	and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment.	3.091315060291724
15654. no one	here pokes fun at manly virtues.	6.579897651340977
15655. and this gives rise to an easy camaraderie	probably unequaled elsewhere in the ivy league.	4.2537394013985
15656. it even affects	the faculty.	9.010032099770283
15657. thus when dartmouth's winter carnival-	widely recognized as the greatest wildest roaringest college weekend	anywhere any time- was broadcast over a national television hookup	prexy john sloan dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter	garb topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been	acquired from a smith girl.	3.078063405462715
15658. president dickey's golden retriever	frolicking in the snow at his feet added to the picture of masculine	informality.	6.720578906200233
15659. this carefree disdain for side cropped up	again in the same television broadcast.	4.052364878759235
15660. dean thaddeus seymour wearing	ski clothes was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the carnival.	4.898815078352072
15661. she must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown	on her head.	3.9519377545897214
15662. no dartmouth man was surprised.	8.20575306005447
15663. dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal	sang-froid.	4.2704077563971765
15664. for example groups regularly canoe down the connecticut	river.	7.1577840786437035
15665. this is in honor of john ledyard class of 1773 who scooped	a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in	his own student days.	3.7113421403020705
15666. and these hardy travelers are not unappreciated	today.	7.080499290650218
15667. they are hailed by the nation's press and smith girls throng	the riverbanks at northampton and refresh the voyageurs with	hot soup and kisses.	3.2152618558647217
15668. dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic	recreation is skiing.	6.15351606382679
15669. since the days when their two thousand	pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the united	states the students have stopped regarding the olympic ski team	as another name for their own.	3.447739538509631
15670. yet dartmouth still is the dominant	member of the intercollegiate ski union which includes the winter	sports colleges of canada as well as those of this country.	5.633376954708366
15671. dartmouth	students ski everywhere in winter starting with their own front	door.	4.20322857880374
15672. they can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him or move	out to oak hill where there's a lift.	5.448379871839845
15673. the dartmouth skiway	at holt's ledge ten miles north of the campus has one of the best	terrains in the east ranging from novice to expert.	3.558608583771594
15674. forty	miles farther north is mount moosilauke dartmouth's own mountain.	5.492427487506607
15675. here at the ravine lodge president dickey acts as host every	year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the dartmouth	outing club to life on the trails.	3.573887382242938
15676. the lodge built of hand-hewn	virgin spruce can handle fifty people for dining sleeping or	lounging in its huge living room.	4.354544140377169
15677. the outing club also owns a chain	of fourteen cabins and several shelters extending from the vermont	hills just across the river from the college through hanover to the	college grant- 27000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in	the logging country.	2.882203803972935
15678. the cabins are equipped with bunks blankets	and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips.	4.610388740601822
15679. the club runs regular trips to the cabins but many of the students	prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting	fishing climbing or skiing.	3.3588976484224573
15680. under the auspices of the outing	club dartmouth also has the mountaineering club which takes	on tough climbs like mount mckinley and bait + bullet whose interests	are self-evident and even sports a woodman's team which	competes with other new england colleges in wood sawing and	chopping	canoe races and the like.	4.451983580991142
15681. there is much to be said for a college	that while happily attuned to the sophisticated ivies still gives	its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along	back roads where a glimpse of small game deer or even bear is not	uncommon.	3.593525627509882
15682. city boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle	or in the sharp tang of a sawmill come upon suddenly in a backwoods	logging camp.	5.349627206805496
15683. and on the summit of mount washington where thirty-five	degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered	higher than anywhere else in the world there is a kind of wisdom	to be found that other men often seek in the himalayas because	it is there.	3.792185956985927
15684. there is much to be said for such a college-	and dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too	loudly.	6.044345937838529
15685. their affection for their college home has even caused president	dickey to comment on this place loyalty as something rather	specially hanoverian.	3.5473181875091773
15686. probably a lawyer once said it best for	all time in the supreme court of the united states.	7.779451738456706
15687. early in the	nineteenth century the state of new hampshire was casting about	for a way to found its own state university.	4.188604957122546
15688. it fixed on dartmouth college	which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered.	5.964277840794269
15689. the	legislators decided to liberate dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war	with the college trustees over the control of classrooms faculty	and chapel.	3.402122646813204
15690. for a time there were two factions on the campus	fighting for possession of the student body.	6.675405816688891
15691. the struggle was	resolved in 1819 in the supreme court in one of the most intriguing	cases in our judicial history.	4.0089250156334835
15692. in 1817 the lawyers were generally debating	the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters.	5.143607508168856
15693. a lawyer	hired by the college was arguing specifically for dartmouth:	daniel webster class of 1801 made her plight the dramatic focus	of his whole plea.	3.1026969560795146
15694. in an age of oratory he was the king of orators	and both he himself and chief justice marshall were bathed in manly	tears as uncle dan'l reached his thundering climax:   it	is sir as i have said a small college and yet there are those	who love it h.	5.206615444326794
15695. dartmouth is today still a small college-	and still a private one thanks to webster's eloquence.	3.910255957892765
15696. this	is not out of keeping with its origins probably the most humble of	any in the ivy group.	6.351425969469659
15697. eleazar wheelock a presbyterian minister	founded the school in 1769 naming it after the second earl of dartmouth	its sponsor and benefactor.	3.3142445549930573
15698. eleazar pausing on the hanover plain	found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands	built the first college hall a log hut dedicated for the education	+ instruction of youth of the indian tribes in this land in reading	writing + all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and	expedient for civilizing + christianizing children of pagans as well	as in all liberal arts and sciences; and also of english youth	and any others.	4.350063536693256
15699. it was a hardy undertaking and wheelock's	was indeed a voice crying in the wilderness.	3.9132863020027355
15700. a road had to	be	hacked through trackless forests between hanover and portsmouth to	permit governor wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first	dartmouth commencement in 1771.	4.786127742695054
15701. the governor and his retinue thoughtfully	brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still	one of the cherished possessions of the college.	3.224149972304844
15702. the exuberance	on this occasion set a standard for subsequent dartmouth gatherings.	4.927522610081812
15703. a student orator produced tears from a great number of the learned	even before the punch was served.	3.8000796606523557
15704. then from the branches of a	near-by tree an indian underclassman disdaining both the platform and	the english language harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue.	4.745887179523427
15705. governor wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green	beneath the three-hundred-foot pines and a barrel of rum was broached.	3.3824985617434766
15706. the cook got drunk and president wheelock proved to be a man	of broad talents by carving the ox himself.	5.135211838553076
15707. future commencements	were more decorous perhaps but the number of graduates increased	from the original four at a relatively slow pace.	3.8793360958869854
15708. by the end of the	nineteenth	century in 1893 when the big three columbia and penn	were populous centers of learning dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine.	5.511835419554813
15709. the dormitories including the beloved dartmouth hall could barely	house two hundred students in spartan fashion.	3.1020624633837715
15710. then in 1893	dr william jewett tucker became president and the college's	great awakening began.	5.903641879116818
15711. he transformed dartmouth from a small new	hampshire institution into a national college.	3.8286261436368623
15712. by 1907 the number of	undergraduates had risen to 1107.	6.315529307387846
15713. and at his last commencement in	that year dr tucker and dartmouth were honored by the presence	of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the	college.	3.4216373023544544
15714. the presidents of cornell wisconsin ccny	bowdoin vermont brown columbia princeton yale and harvard	and the presidents emeritus of harvard and michigan were there.	4.201994372052563
15715. dartmouth is numerically still a small college today with approximately	twenty-nine hundred undergraduates.	4.165532037299121
15716. but it has achieved a	cross-section of students from almost all the states and two-thirds of	its undergraduates come from outside new england.	5.955349799683646
15717. over 450 different	schools are usually represented in each entering class.	4.32942328913272
15718. only a dozen	or so schools send as many as six students and there are seldom more	than fifteen men in any single delegation.	5.980166539952436
15719. about two-thirds of the	boys now come from public schools.	4.478754554812972
15720. it is still a college only	and not a university; it is in fact the only college in the ivy	group.	7.1502557227081205
15721. however three distinguished associated graduate schools offer	professional curriculums- the dartmouth medical school	the thayer school of engineering	and the amos tuck school of business administration.	3.227683320143481
15722. all	three are purposely kept small with a current total enrollment of	about two hundred.	5.091578565820695
15723. all three schools coordinate their educational	programs with that of the undergraduate college and like the college	proper	place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation	for specialized study.	3.5030540994829455
15724. students of the college who are candidates	for the ab degree and can satisfy the academic requirements	of the medical and business schools may enter either of these associated	schools at the beginning of senior year thus completing the	two-year postgraduate course in one year.	5.004604649072438
15725. the thayer school offers	a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way after a boy wins	a bs in engineering.	3.259847624095641
15726. so dartmouth is moving closer	to the others in the ivy group.	6.769070183061602
15727. it is still however the junior member	of the league if not in years at least in the catching up it has	had to do.	3.8532273209096735
15728. it has not been a well-known school for any part of the span	the other ivies have enjoyed.	6.652292589050883
15729. however much football has been over-emphasized	the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by	the scoreboard so while yale need never give its record a thought again	since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 dartmouth	had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national	recognition.	3.0454808009875127
15730. it has come on with a rush in more significant areas.	6.852894165982703
15731. today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions	might consider somewhat breathtaking.	3.9028263971365615
15732. but dartmouth preserves	its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes and although	some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage they	make for lively copy.	5.171309951109747
15733. president emeritus hopkins once proposed	to corral an aristocracy of brains in hanover.	3.766978279589296
15734. the person who left the buggy there has never been identified.	5.831653128035706
15735. it was	a busy street conveniently near the shopping center and unattended	horses and wagons were often left at the curbside.	3.596269838938411
15736. there are	of course many weaknesses in any case against emma.	7.46104049690424
15737. she didn't like	her stepmother but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before	the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage.	3.671741877695521
15738. she had no	way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed.	6.142895851238044
15739. she would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized	during her travels.	4.4390811799291505
15740. if she avoided the train and hired a buggy	the stableman might have recognized her.	6.079315800267267
15741. if police had checked on	her more thoroughly than is indicated she would be completely eliminated	as a suspect.	3.6364280760077885
15742. uncle john vinnicum morse was the immediate	popular suspect.	6.291941293234308
15743. his sudden unannounced appearance at the borden	home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him	although he clearly intended to stay overnight if not longer.	3.432582945986868
15744. lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were	in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders she had been	disturbed by their voices and had closed her door even though it was	a very hot day.	5.180448591609001
15745. it is evident that lizzie did not tell everything	she overheard between her father and her uncle morse.	3.926294494626634
15746. at that	time jennings had a young law associate named arthur s phillips.	6.096603516416048
15747. a few years ago not too long before his death phillips revealed	in a newspaper story that he had always suspected morse of the murders.	4.245222839631163
15748. he said morse and borden had quarreled violently in the house that	day information which must have come from lizzie.	5.935819387873506
15749. it was obviously	the sound of this argument that caused lizzie to close her door.	3.8337494236986447
15750. the new bedford standard-times has reported knowlton	as saying long after the trial that if he only knew what borden said	during his conversation with morse he would have convicted somebody.	5.398220586606155
15751. notice knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a	conviction in the trial of lizzie borden.	4.712132899182404
15752. he said he would have convicted	somebody.	11.165258093799597
15753. it is known that morse did associate with	a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at	westport a town not far from fall river.	3.4704327558609602
15754. they were a vagabond lot	and considered to be shady and undesirable characters.	5.867195143798999
15755. fall river police	did go to westport to see if they could get any information against	morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from	among these men.	3.59667796089114
15756. these officers found no incriminating information.	6.8049415245009985
15757. morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed.	4.105577530800969
15758. he said he	returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar.	6.2250111661536645
15759. the woman	in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said	she left when he did to shop for her dinner.	3.3516020573194014
15760. fall river is not a	fashionable town.	7.466335308705203
15761. the dinner hour there was twelve noon.	4.043735849346863
15762. if this woman	had delayed until after 11:20 to start her shopping she would have	had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was	eaten at dinner in those days.	5.089025004558375
15763. it is possible that morse told the woman	it was 11:20 but it could have been earlier since she did serve	dinner on time.	4.004817901420845
15764. police did make an attempt to check on morse's alibi.	6.510949834747423
15765. they interviewed the conductor of the streetcar morse said he	had taken but the man did not remember morse as a passenger.	3.607638910982626
15766. questioned	further morse said that there had been four or five priests riding	on the same car with him.	6.073261320506832
15767. the conductor did recall having priests	as passengers and this satisfied police although the conductor also	pointed out that in heavily catholic fall river there were priests	riding on almost every trip the streetcar made so morse's statement	really proved nothing.	2.927074561110587
15768. we do know that morse left the house	before nine o'clock.	6.756552216851952
15769. bridget testified she saw him leave through the	side door.	4.076491056513394
15770. morse said borden let him out and locked the screen door.	6.428923030705188
15771. from that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked	leisurely to where his niece was staying more than a mile away.	4.859466595455146
15772. he met nobody he knew on this walk.	6.713090023250594
15773. there is no accounting of his movements	in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when mrs	borden was killed.	3.5530024790336143
15774. morse testified that while he was having	breakfast in the dining room mrs borden told the servant bridget	i want you to wash these windows today.	5.521315076797704
15775. bridget's testimony	was in direct contradiction.	4.558572564143688
15776. she said it was after she returned	from her vomiting spell in the back yard that mrs borden told	her to wash the windows.	5.731274591833371
15777. this was long after morse had left the house.	4.778399656034925
15778. morse's knowledge of what mrs borden told bridget could	indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden	there.	6.176275322007823
15779. he knew the house fairly well he had been there on two previous	visits during the past three or four months alone.	4.411343536187196
15780. and despite knowlton's	attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than	a drum this was not true.	6.4515144218841565
15781. the screen door was unlocked for some ten	or fifteen minutes while bridget was sick in the back.	3.393791014549448
15782. it was unlocked	all the time she was washing windows.	6.840583011201365
15783. morse could have returned	openly while bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room	he had occupied.	4.091558129472247
15784. mrs borden would not have been alarmed if she	saw morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand.	5.914738903150554
15785. he had been to the farm	the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet	at the farm.	4.154888160537894
15786. mrs borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him	and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she	could cry out.	5.959981045865747
15787. he could have left for weybosset street after her	murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar.	4.166698171163509
15788. if	he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return he could	have arrived at the borden house shortly after mr borden came	home.	4.951775926124228
15789. with lizzie in the barn the screen door unlocked and bridget	upstairs in her attic room he would have had free and easy access to	the house.	3.7003317841146375
15790. with the second murder over he could have left hidden the	weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood.	5.529929795552156
15791. his unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree	with crowds already gathering in front of the building and sawyer guarding	the side door was odd.	4.047338459715372
15792. there was no close examination of his	clothes for bloodstains and certainly no scientific test was made of	them.	5.709110382642162
15793. and for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing	a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed.	3.827486789263406
15794. the motive may have been the mysterious quarrel; there was	no financial gain for morse in the murders.	5.302681724398858
15795. on the other side	of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with	whom she was staying.	4.555885458198248
15796. the time would have been shortly after the	murder of mrs borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior.	5.292981765584899
15797. he said he had promised mrs borden to return in time for dinner	and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the borden	house.	4.546346832572465
15798. what did pearson say about bridget sullivan as a possible	suspect in his trial-book essay?	5.6470833290809
15799.  he wrote:   the	police soon ceased to look upon either bridget or mr morse as in	possession of guilty knowledge.	3.3531126472987878
15800. neither had any interest in the deaths;	indeed it was probably to mr morse's advantage to have	mr and mrs borden alive.	5.801008102969256
15801. both he and bridget were exonerated	by lizzie herself.	4.755085581637937
15802. that was his complete discussion of bridget	sullivan as a possible suspect.	6.72115755299574
15803. although pearson disbelieved	almost everything lizzie said and read a sinister purpose into almost	everything she did he happily accepted her statement about bridget	as the whole truth.	3.277475468156355
15804. he felt nothing further need be said about the	servant girl.	6.427858191565286
15805. the exoneration pearson speaks of is not an exoneration	but lizzie's expression of her opinion as reported in the	testimony of assistant marshal fleet.	3.193030683652887
15806. this officer had asked lizzie	if she suspected her uncle morse and she replied she didn't	think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned	after them.	5.301920635113751
15807. fleet asked the same question about bridget and lizzie	pointed out that as far as she knew bridget had gone up to her	room	before her father's murder and came down when she called her.	3.4653772262227602
15808. lizzie actually never named any suspect.	6.770528768440003
15809. she told police about	the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some	weeks before the murders but she said she thought he was from out of	town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner.	3.442261689116811
15810. and much as she detested hiram harrington she also did not	accuse him.	5.778698481253014
15811. at the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew	anybody her father had bad feelings toward or who had bad feelings	toward	her father.	3.5851635904956902
15812. she replied i know of one man that has not been	friendly with him.	6.714105851807703
15813. they have not been friendly for years.	6.141450505887885
15814. asked	who this was she named harrington.	6.722097171922315
15815. her statement certainly was true;	the press reported the same facts in using harrington's interview	but lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that harrington was the	killer.	3.4470584984847177
15816. when i interviewed kirby who as a boy picked up pears	in the borden yard i asked if anybody else in the household besides	lizzie and morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the	murders.	5.62827828114109
15817. he said he had not heard of anybody else.	5.2137823208455405
15818. how about bridget	sullivan?	11.227092865459346
15819.  i inquired.	7.429944241093908
15820. oh she was just the maid there	he replied waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant	she was.	5.622917062362936
15821. kirby was of course reflecting the opinion that existed	at the time of the murders.	4.524493475585054
15822. everyone somehow manages to overlook	completely the fact that as far as we know there were exactly two	people in and about the house at the time of both murders: lizzie	borden and bridget sullivan.	6.1639189791348565
15823. all the officials on the case	seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as bridget was	concerned although records in police files contain many reports of	servants who have murdered their employers.	3.497601502243322
15824. true it is no longer cricket	for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction but we are dealing	here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters	and situations.	5.804739123564311
15825. the actions of bridget should be examined	since she was there and opportunity did exist if only to establish her	innocence.	3.442444748682008
15826. there are also other factors that require closer examination.	7.186169524537349
15827. the legend as it exists in fall river today always includes	the solemn assurance that bridget returned to ireland after the	trial with a big bundle of cash which lizzie gave her for keeping	her mouth shut.	2.9248800975362186
15828. the people who believe and retell the legend have	apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know	that the maid changed her testimony on several key points always to	the detriment of lizzie.	4.817842832630848
15829. if bridget did get any bundles of cash	the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would	have been lizzie borden.	3.4071147607026337
15830. bridget was born in ireland one	of fourteen children.	7.691267234258205
15831. she was apparently the pioneer in her family because	she had no close relatives in this country at that time.	4.226740831899818
15832. she worked	as a domestic first in newport for a year and then in south	bethlehem pennsylvania for another year.	5.983167636513385
15833. she finally settled in fall	river and after being employed for a time by a mrs reed was	hired by the bordens.	3.7166758767223698
15834. i have previously described how during	the week of the murder bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing	and ironing clothes.	5.821273616944498
15835. her father james upton was the upton mentioned by hawthorne in	the famous introduction to the scarlet letter as one of those who	came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor	of the port.	3.5437390441437895
15836. a gentleman of the old school mr upton possessed	intellectual power ample means and withal was a devoted christian.	5.333102878725966
15837. the daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical	subjects.	3.695454830365053
15838. her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad	interests.	6.78086692781798
15839. there is clear evidence that lucy from childhood	had an unusual mind.	4.323133397393875
15840. she possessed an observant eye a retentive memory	and a critical faculty.	5.532619024178801
15841. when she was nine years old she wrote	a description of a store she had visited.	4.36541572494645
15842. she named 48 items and said	there were many more things which it would take too long to write.	5.826633547984398
15843. an essay on freedom written at 10 years of age quoted the	declaration of independence the freedom given to slaves in canada	and the views of george washington.	3.725867442587724
15844. lucy upton was graduated	from the salem high school when few colleges only oberlin and	elmira were open to women; and she had an appetite for learning	that could not be denied.	5.032099774572949
15845. a picture of her in high school comes	from a younger schoolmate albert s flint friend of her brother	winslow and later like winslow a noted astronomer.	3.415817235036126
15846. he recalled	lucy as a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly	through the boys' study hall to join the class in greek in the little	recitation room beyond.	4.883789771846161
15847. the study of greek was the distinctive	mark of boys destined to go to college and lucy upton too expected	to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men.	3.5599499958679806
15848. the death of her mother in 1865 prevented this.	6.346888547435825
15849. with four younger	children at home lucy stepped into her mother's role and even after	the brothers and sisters were grown she was her father's comfort	and stay until he died in 1879.	3.2001729157337087
15850. but even so lucy could not give up	her intellectual pursuits.	6.810824476430791
15851. when her brother winslow became a student	at brown university in 1874 she wrote him about a course in history	he was taking under professor diman: what is prof diman's	definition of civilization and take the world through is its progress	ever onward or does it retrograde at times?	3.2158449332974812
15852.  do you think i	might profitably study some of the history you do perhaps two weeks	behind you h.	6.385630695563221
15853. and that she proceeded to do.	6.002881922066706
15854. many years later	lucy upton wrote winslow's daughter soon	to be graduated from smith college: while i love botany which	after dabbling in for years i studied according to the methods	of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school it must be fascinating	to take up zoology in the way you are doing.	5.233505979743774
15855. whatever was the	science in the high school course for the time being that was my favorite	study.	4.177476722318752
15856. her study of history	was persistently pursued.	7.335134235227894
15857. she read maitland's dark ages which	i enjoyed very much; la croix on the customs of the middle	ages; 16 chapters of bryce and liked it more and more;	more chapters of guizot; lecky and stanley's eastern church.	2.971653228150688
15858. she discussed in her letters to winslow some of the questions	that came to her as she studied alone.	6.258877154676699
15859. lucy's correspondence	with brother winslow during his college days was not entirely taken	up with academic studies.	3.601122405611629
15860. she played chess with him by postcard.	7.389466431670314
15861. also lucy and winslow had a private contest to see which one could	make the most words from the letters in importunately.	3.602131143297741
15862. who won	is not revealed but winslow's daughter eleanor says they got up to	1212 words.	5.545738860181654
15863. there was another family interest also.	5.544770193834137
15864. winslow	had musical talents as had his father before him.	6.020523311528633
15865. at different times	he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist.	4.048539970002509
15866. and it was	lucy upton who first started the idea of a regular course in music	at spelman college.	6.329492549981032
15867. winslow upton after graduation from brown	university and two years of graduate study accepted a position	at the harvard observatory.	3.5730325531483373
15868. for three years he was connected with	the us naval observatory and with the us signal corps;	and after 1883 was professor of astronomy at brown university.	5.340577297214986
15869. the six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun of which he was	a member took him to colorado virginia and california as well as	to the south pacific and to russia.	3.334808469247852
15870. after her father's death lucy	and her youngest sister lived for a few years with winslow in washington	dc.	6.257172624764277
15871. their house writes albert s flint	was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer especially grateful	to one like myself far from home.	3.398322575469365
15872. lucy was a lively part of the	household.	7.210603132612223
15873. moreover she had physical as well as mental vigor.	5.426254933300796
15874. winslow	as his daughters eleanor and margaret recall used to characterize	her as our iron sister.	5.051603424643923
15875. there is reason to suppose that lucy	would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother	had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about	to enter college.	3.663062892703956
15876. as a matter of fact albert s flint expressed	his conviction that her physical strength her mental power her	lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve	her fellow beings would have led her to a distinguished career	amongst the noted women of this country.	4.893404668319596
15877. while in washington	dc lucy upton held positions in the us census	office and in the pension bureau.	4.750686404662372
15878. they were not sufficiently challenging	however and she resigned in 1887 to go to germany with her	brother winslow and his family while he was there on study.	6.032446342466265
15879. after the	months in europe she returned to boston and became active in church	and community life.	3.872589911779451
15880. what was called an accidental meeting	with miss packard in washington turned her attention to spelman.	6.068693766950741
15881. here was a cause she believed in.	5.257453718145842
15882. after correspondence with miss	packard and to the joy of miss packard and miss giles she came	to atlanta in the fall of 1888 to help wherever needed although	there was then no money available to pay her a salary.	5.36854156463925
15883. she served for	a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance.	4.246072770728397
15884. her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship	and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students;	of her great power of discernment; of her exquisiteness	of dress her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts	of the hearers; her great love of flowers and plants and birds;	and her close knowledge of individual students.	4.369047300725649
15885. she drew	on all her resources of mind and heart to help them- to make them	at home in the world; and as graduates gratefully recall she drew on	her purse as well.	3.4194705178456695
15886. many a student was able to remain at spelman only	because of her unobtrusive help.	6.593095940921038
15887. under miss upton the work	of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption.	4.021590584817318
15888. after all	she had come to spelman seminary in 1888 and had been since 1891 except	for one year associate principal or dean.	5.202339905595801
15889. she had taught classes	in botany astronomy geometry	and	psychology.	4.8350984203123915
15890. miss upton and miss packard as a matter of fact	had many tastes in common.	6.516687098752345
15891. both had eager and inquiring minds; and	both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the	development of sturdy character and christian zeal.	3.416175941232999
15892. both loved the	out-of-doors including mountain climbing and horseback riding.	6.020778426706562
15893. in 1890	when the trip to europe and the holy land was arranged for miss	packard it was miss upton who planned the trip and with rare	executive ability bore the brunt of the entire pilgrimage from	beginning to end.	3.308108645245033
15894. so strenuous it was physically with its days of	horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance	for both miss packard and miss upton.	4.997907948462936
15895. yet they thrived on	it.	6.293058348638691
15896. at the fifteenth	anniversary as already quoted miss	upton projected with force and eloquence the spelman of the future	as a college of first rank with expanding and unlimited horizons.	4.861471389591381
15897. when dr wallace buttrick wise in his judgment of people declined	to have the science building named for him he wrote miss tapley	h if you had asked me i think i would have	suggested that you name the building for miss upton.	3.4452260252815865
15898. her services	to the school for many years were of a very high character and i	have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her.	6.123981037249959
15899. such were the qualities of the acting-president of the seminary	after the death of miss giles.	4.292714274151041
15900. at the meeting of the	board of trustees on march 3 1910 miss upton presented the annual	report of the president.	5.554392551096734
15901. she noted that no student had been withdrawn	through loss of confidence; that the enrollment showed an increase	of boarding students as was desired; and that the year's work	had gone forward smoothly.	3.2616913837134844
15902. she urged the importance of more thorough	preparation for admission.	7.122768812805592
15903. the raising of the $25000 improvement	fund two days before the time limit expired and the spontaneous praise	demonstration held afterward on the campus were reported as	events which had brought happiness to miss giles.	2.98945447390337
15904. with the fund in	hand the debt on the boilers had been paid; rockefeller and packard	halls had been renovated; walks laid; and ground had been broken	for the superintendent's home.	4.692050373629276
15905. miss upton spoke gratefully of	the response of spelman graduates and negro friends in helping to raise	the fund and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly	needed current expenses.	3.4066838961742842
15906. she spoke also with deep thankfulness of the	many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the	years had made the work so fruitful in results.	4.9796714463545415
15907. two bequests	were recorded: one of $200 under the will of mrs harriet a	copp of los angeles; and one of $2000 under the will of miss celia	l brett of hamilton new york a friend from the early days.	3.648065231185945
15908. miss upton told the trustees that the death of miss giles	was the sorest grief the seminary had ever been called upon	to bear.	5.610143950412803
15909. the daughters of spelman she said had never known or thought	of spelman without her.	3.278131120286422
15910. the removal of miss packard 18 years earlier	had caused them great sorrow but they still had miss giles.	5.24157374259934
15911. now the school was indeed bereft.	5.854174856586736
15912. yet spelman has strong deep roots	and will live for the blessing of generations to come.	5.576408553001405
15913. miss mary jane packard sophia's half-sister became ill in	march 1910; and when school closed she was unable to travel to massachusetts.	3.511772870238664
15914. she remained in atlanta through june and july; she	died on august sixth.	5.799862314912646
15915. before coming on a visit to spelman	in 1885 miss mary had been a successful teacher in worcester and	her position there was held open for her for a considerable period.	3.8209326693762207
15916. but	she decided to stay at spelman.	7.282057842894028
15917. she helped with teaching as well	as office work for a few years- the catalogues show that she had classes	in geography rhetoric and bookkeeping.	3.7506246917282207
15918. soon the office work claimed	all her time.	7.207739235689933
15919. she was closely associated with the founders in all	their trials and hardships.	4.363492299262223
15920. quiet and energetic cheerful and calm	she too was a power in the development of the seminary.	6.13152396433418
15921. miss giles	always used to refer to her as sister.	4.794543105678146
15922. she served as secretary	in the seminary office for 25 years and was in charge of correspondence	records and bookkeeping.	6.094868507413877
15923. the books of the school hold a memorial	to her; and so do the hearts of students and of teachers.	3.690844687691552
15924. mary j packard states a messenger editorial was efficient	pains-taking self-effacing loving radiating the spirit of her	master.	5.573083162524061
15925. with infinite patience she responded to every call no matter	at what cost to herself and to her all went for she was sure to	have the needed information or word of cheer.	3.331597288878283
15926. in a few school districts one finds a link between school and	job.	6.620236546692586
15927. in those vocational programs organized with smith-hughes money	there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer	on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other.	3.8595352759101673
15928. in these cases	a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program saving	a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12.	5.531867028768157
15929. the apprentice	program will involve further education on a part-time basis usually	at night perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high	school.	3.4536989727869836
15930. these opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such	crafts as auto mechanics carpentry drafting electrical work tool-and-die	work and sheet-metal work.	5.3112657381534225
15931. formally organized vocational	programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to	gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time	job on graduation.	3.8368048972307434
15932. the diversified occupations program is a	part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on	a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business	employers.	4.4867701948143575
15933. the distributive education program operates in	a similar way with arrangements between the school and employers in	merchandising	fields.	3.3337831435392444
15934. in both cases the student attends school half-time	and works in a regular job the other half.	5.831957940040705
15935. he receives remuneration	for his work.	4.686636604752437
15936. in a few places cooperative programs between schools	and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing	the student while still in school to develop skills which are	immediately marketable upon graduation.	5.049127865896487
15937. adult education courses	work-study programs of various sorts- these are all evidence of	a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities	for out-of-school youth.	3.4526149064151226
15938. in general however it may be said	that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school the school authorities	play little or no part in the decision of what happens next.	6.279339114417796
15939. if the	student drops out of high school the break with the school is even	more complete.	4.6323849359150016
15940. when there is employment opportunity for youth this	arrangement- or lack of arrangement- works out quite well.	5.6705588844176225
15941. indeed	in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities	have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were	potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and	went to work.	3.5647262192832705
15942. statistically this has represented a loss to the nation	although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in	retrospect may have been a wise one.	5.644469972990522
15943. i make no attempt to measure the	enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work	on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business	which he entered.	3.91158150659901
15944. he may or may not be better off than his	classmate who went on to a college and professional school.	6.738284879363466
15945. but in	the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all	the potential professional talent.	3.572741361644253
15946. in a later chapter dealing	with the suburban school i shall discuss the importance of arranging	a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any	high school where he is found.	5.1805458004626
15947. in the negro neighborhoods and also	to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of	identification and motivation.	3.6769041825776894
15948. high motivation towards higher education	must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches	grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are	essential for academic work.	5.2319686189724965
15949. undoubtedly far more can be done in the	lower grades in this regard in the negro schools.	4.540298677188453
15950. however the teacher	can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family	is anti-intellectual.	6.894737834817887
15951. and the fact remains that there are today few	shining examples of negroes in positions of intellectual leadership.	4.826235708296906
15952. this is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the northern	universities.	7.235701716379934
15953. quite the contrary as i can testify from personal	experience as a former university president.	4.3079872488951665
15954. rather we see here	another vicious circle.	7.386427935333034
15955. the absence of successful negroes in the world	of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among	negro youth for academic careers.	3.4839047375885617
15956. i believe the situation is improving	but the success stories need to be heavily publicized.	7.101282803990791
15957. here again	we run into the roadblock that negroes do not like to be designated	as negroes in the press.	4.241173919631063
15958. how can the vicious circle be broken?	7.930817569135098
15959.  this	is a problem to which leaders of opinion both negro and white	should devote far more attention.	3.8906721241601674
15960. it is at least as important as the	more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the south.	6.182760148253
15961. i should like to underline four points	i made in my first report with respect to vocational education.	3.933738806153965
15962. first	and foremost vocational courses should not replace courses which	are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation.	5.560067465492394
15963. second	vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and	not require more than half the student's time in those years; however	for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to	begin earlier.	3.185503827770343
15964. third the significance of the vocational courses is	that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work; they realize	the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers and this	sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they	are studying at the same time.	5.30990874133622
15965. fourth the type of vocational training	programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the	general locality.	3.9697080212519062
15966. this last point is important because if high school	pupils are aware that few if any graduates who have chosen a certain	vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training	the whole idea of relevance disappears.	4.964787133862941
15967. vocational training which	holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable	skill becomes just another school chore for those whose interest	in their studies has begun to falter.	3.5891643870809866
15968. those who because of population	mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees	would limit vocational education to general rather than specific	skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind	of school experience.	4.98197566832755
15969. i have been using the word vocational	as a layman would at first sight think it should be used.	4.277359842431041
15970. i intend	to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys	and girls.	5.699545639358849
15971. these courses develop skills other than those we think of	when we use the adjective academic.	3.8269510852396826
15972. practically all of these practical	skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained	in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at	once on the basis of the skill.	5.848619103563004
15973. they are in this sense skills marketable	immediately on graduation from high school.	4.959317446651428
15974. to be sure in tool-and-die	work and in the building trades the first job must be often	on an apprentice basis but two years of half-time vocational training	enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status.	5.596602997864921
15975. similarly a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography	and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job	at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two	of further study in a community college or secretarial school.	3.711533665914506
15976. of course	it can be argued that an ability to write english correctly and	with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill.	5.509084206933182
15977. so too is the	mathematical	competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics.	4.187990436490919
15978. in a sense almost all high school and college courses could be	considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student	in his vocation will be called upon to use	some of the skills developed and the competence obtained.	5.301523731992618
15979. in spite	of the shading of one type of course into another i believe it is useful	to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses.	3.527487459618779
15980. perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which	proves the rule.	6.743551075849924
15981. today many college bound students try to take a	course in personal typing as they feel a certain degree of mastery of	this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work	in college and a professional school.	3.394506267572008
15982. most of our largest	cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools.	6.954340841059927
15983. in this respect public education in the large cities differs from education	in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts.	3.98770790944214
15984. the	neighborhood high schools are not strictly speaking comprehensive schools	because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational	or technical high school instead of the local school.	5.789189142712123
15985. indeed one	school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term	comprehensive	high school for the senior high schools in his city because	these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs.	4.040032481027029
15986. he prefers	to designate such schools as general high schools.	5.885699153774174
15987. the suburban	high school it is worth noting also is not a widely comprehensive	high school because of the absence of vocational programs.	3.962018261086417
15988. the reason	is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community.	7.252316448486804

16243. at the	base of the rocky hillside they left their horses and climbed on foot.	3.933689839430176

16245. nice country to meet a lion in	face to face.	4.202459412179162
16246. ulyate and kearton climbed on toward the sound of the	barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion till they	came out of breath to the crest and peering through the branches of	a bush this is what ulyate saw: jones who had apparently	ridden up the nearly impassable hillside sitting calmly on	his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness who was crouched	on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him while the	dogs whirled around her.	4.507060596537242
16247. ulyate drew back with a start and put	finger to lips almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her	off the dogs have got her bayed h.	3.317040237941819

16249. why she doesn't	charge him i don't know.	4.737610937028732
16250. and he hasn't even got a knife on	him.	7.228014216790397
16251. he couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground h.	4.542522697666164
16252. jones had been about a hundred	and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the	reef.	6.281475607344994
16253. she was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when	she saw him she rose to full height and roared opening her mouth wide	lashing her tail and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in	irritation as much as to say: how dare you disturb me in my sacred	precinct?	3.1497911186533045
16254.    intuition told him however that she was tired	and winded from the run up the reef and would not charge yet.	5.846995310180412
16255. he	moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her being careful because	he knew the female is less predictable than the male.	3.3646110051381055
16256. at nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game	hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso.	5.483424354879965
16257. of the thirty-four seventeen had been killed by lions and eleven out	she snarled terribly but intuition	told	him again that she was bluffing and he could see that half her	attention was distracted by the dogs.	3.56458998233918
16258. it was falling	over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front	of her on the rock.	5.229773069358159
16259. even then if she took one step forward he could	catch her.	4.5393265032895656
16260. but john nipped her rear end- one lion's rear end	was as good as another to john africa arizona no matter- and she	changed ends and took a swipe at john but he ducked back.	4.7500301777890614
16261. jones	then recoiled his rope and threw again this time hitting her on	the back but failing to encircle her.	3.3812044246851385
16262. she whirled and faced him roaring	terribly and ulyate watching through the leaves could not understand	why she did not charge and obliterate him because he wouldn't	have much of a chance of getting away in that thick growth but she	seemed just a trace uncertain; while jones on the other hand appeared	perfectly confident and ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer.	4.7922481101964145
16263. from the lioness' point of view this strange creature	on the back of another creature lashing out with its long thin paw	very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with.	3.579262215613087
16264. but	now she sank lower to the rock.	6.325105085647904
16265. her roar changed to a growl.	5.208209280850527
16266. her	tail	no longer lashed.	8.097814988161069
16267. although she appeared more subdued and defeated	jones knew she was growing more dangerous.	3.8515113585617122
16268. she was rested and could	mount a charge.	7.1312656815097135
16269. just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched	and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet.	3.817077580015622
16270. at this moment loveless and means arrived crashing through the undergrowth	with their horses and distracted her and she ran off a short	distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks.	5.055139660042352
16271. the dogs followed	her and she killed three and badly wounded old john.	3.530580741194815
16272. we've	got to get her out of there! jones yelled or she'll	kill 'em all.	5.13702932683987
16273. for such an	emergency he had included fourth-of-july cannon crackers as part of	their equipment.	3.735475105123713
16274. lighting one he pitched it into the crevice and the	lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed.	5.463813100826152
16275. ain't she	a beauty though?	4.83788284821529
16276.  called out means as she ran.	7.7430337691441995
16277. don't	you go a step nearer her than i do jones warned and if	you do go at a run so you'll have momentum!   for two hours	they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of	the reef trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get	a good throw.	3.07547793083266
16278. but she clung to the rocks and brush and the day wore	away.	6.996756738309702
16279. the dogs were tired.	4.814569366576706
16280. the men were tired too.	7.163395237108486
16281. it	was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again.	4.8415843933751415
16282. and the sun was	beginning to go down.	7.634999583559484
16283. if dark came they would lose her.	5.047263362426671
16284. i'll	get a pole jones said finally and i'll poke a noose	over her	head!   at this moment she was crouched in a cave-like	aperture halfway down the reef.	4.658205516244475
16285. ulyate made no comment but his face	showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions' heads with poles	and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago not the gentler	ones of today and this one was angry with good reason.	3.3122532237155324
16286. it won't work colonel.	8.772358228703098
16287. just the	same we'll try it.	5.507403667997173
16288. but without waiting for them to try it	she scattered the dogs and shot down the reef and out across the plain.	6.621431303384339
16289. john led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out	behind many of them trailing blood.	4.489709968725447
16290. john himself was bruised and	clawed from head to tail but he was in this fight to the finish running	almost as strongly now as in the morning.	6.089747235011682
16291. she took refuge	on a tongue of land extending into a gully crouched at the base of a	thorn tree and waited for them to come up.	3.7721792315238445
16292. she had chosen the spot well.	8.376605647582183
16293. with the gully on three sides she could be approached only along	the tongue of land.	3.8866298096543526
16294. means	tried her first.	8.087334903638352
16295. very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding	edging closer watching for a chance to throw but ready to spin and	run rope whining about his head horse edging tensely under him but	the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close	proximity of the lion.	3.0303526258473714
16296. they tell you horses go crazy at the sight	or smell of a bear or a lion but these didn't.	5.257737268967023

16298. means spit and edged on.	7.3296785211916555
16299. again she	snarled and again he edged.	5.279144258450001
16300. the pony was sidewise to her.	5.362207246476225
16301. with a whirling	jump it could get into gear h.	4.803526478505223
16302. however nothing on four legs	was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance unless	it was a cheetah.	5.845682861657996
16303. for thirty	yards she gained rapidly.	5.125403146540167
16304. she was closing and within one more bound	would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay but- and	here jones and loveless and ulyate were holding breath for all they	were worth- she never quite caught up that last bound.	5.29675538753775
16305. means held	steady one jump ahead of her.	4.411417055144693
16306. then gradually he began to pull away.	8.177530667428831
16307. a western cowpony had outrun an african lion from a standing start.	3.6455471644234905
16308. photos showed later that she'd been about six feet from means h.	5.872076522897035
16309. of course the factor of head start made all the difference.	4.822249328815453
16310. how much	head start?	10.10865013443253
16311.  no one knew exactly.	6.566421108836585
16312. that was the whole question.	10.666797955365697
16313. the lioness quickly changed front when	she saw she couldn't catch means and made for jones.	3.1934138909805707
16314. as she had	done with means she gained rapidly at first but then baldy began	to draw away.	5.6869929669599735
16315. somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the	determining point.	4.164353947316843
16316. when jones too drew away she returned to	a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully crouched low	and waited as before.	5.027264553387484
16317. this new position however gave the ropers a	better chance.	4.163663249477048
16318. there was room to make a quick dash past the bush and	throw as you went.	6.682369767695776
16319. so: means edged around on the north side of her	jones moved in from the south.	4.140400484016293
16320. tossing his rope and shouting he attracted	her attention.	5.979321148260302
16321. he succeeded almost too well because once she	rose as if to charge and he half wheeled his horse- he was within	fifty feet- but she sank back.	3.3040321567499937
16322. from behind her means shot	forward at a run.	6.9100714619266945
16323. kearton began shouting wait wait- the camera's	jammed! but means kept on.	3.720569008531082
16324. he raced by within twenty feet	of her roped her around the neck but a lioness' neck is short and	thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off.	4.653894601582792
16325. the missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was	once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies.	3.361453941707377
16326. but the time	came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was	looked upon as deficient in its essential life.	5.493391265144794
16327. the christian education	of children too was once hardly more than a sideshow but the day	came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church	school was thought of as failing in its duty.	3.2023191763644467
16328. the most serious	weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally	regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination	and a few interdenominational executives.	6.243528391289242
16329. most pastors and laymen	even though they believe it to be important assume that the ecumenical	movement lies outside the province of their parishes.	4.026947115346521
16330. they may	even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the	ecclesiastical rover boys as someone has dubbed them who like	to go to national and international assemblies and have expense accounts	that permit them to do so.	4.667563480468576
16331. as long as this point of view	prevails the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt.	4.459726368476942
16332. the next	stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community.	6.147195633319257
16333. progress will take place far less through what is done in any	summit conference of the national council or the world council	or even in offices of the denominational boards than through what	happens in the communities where christian people live together as neighbors.	3.405056396302462
16334. the front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping	congregations of different traditions exist side by side.	4.820771616066737
16335. until they	see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their	own attitudes programs and relationships it will have an inevitable	aspect of unreality.	4.240183121463983
16336. as things now stand there is a grievous disparity	between the unity in christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings	and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any main	street in the nation.	5.051901953319778
16337. the crux	of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation	between congregations in the same community.	3.542855957149786
16338. the decisive question	is what happens within each congregation and finally in the	minds and hearts of the individual members.	5.1444894151448555
16339. it is here that the local	and ecumenical must meet.	4.497789108383391
16340. it is here that the ecumenical must become	local and the local become ecumenical.	6.755392301105647
16341. it has become almost	trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be carried down to the	grass roots.	5.204570178262392
16342. this way of describing the matter is unfortunate.	7.270775771237062
16343. one is that whatever is ecumenical has	to do with some over-all organization at the top and needs only	to be understood at the so-called lower levels.	3.7333212802005553
16344. the truth however	is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its	own true character as an integral unit of the whole people of god	throughout the world.	5.647708423330122
16345. the other misconception is that our ecumenical	problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide	extension and its interdenominational connections now comprehended	by many national leaders can be communicated to all congregations.	3.5848534854508296
16346. however needed this may be the fundamental problem is not information	but active commitment to the total mission of the church of christ	in the world.	6.548218526151977
16347. the basic unit in the church of whatever denominational	polity is always the congregation.	4.347069293613613
16348. it is hardly possible	to emphasize this too much.	6.776643017809999
16349. most people do not realize that the congregation	as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face personally	sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience	in daily relationships with one another is unique.	3.6675757678156824
16350. the idea that it	is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken.	6.17281601320879
16351. the jewish synagogue	affords a parallel to the christian congregation but hinduism	buddhism islam confucianism taoism shintoism although they	have sacred scriptures priests spiritual disciplines and places of	prayer do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and	love.	3.117840223459807
16352. their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an	altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with	a distinctive kind of fellowship.	6.197720211997725
16353. how far the fellowship in most	local churches falls below what the new testament means by koinonia!	what is now called christian fellowship is often little more	than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind	of people one likes.	3.5030957432020666
16354. the koinonia of acts and of the epistles	means sharing in a common relation to christ.	5.399005757323481
16355. it is an experience of	a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate	indwelling of christ in his people.	3.8447783077154
16356. as dietrich bonho^ffer puts	it our community with one another consists solely in what christ	has done to both of us.	5.476661543743269
16357. this may mean having fellowship in the church	with people with whom on the level of merely human agreeableness	we might prefer not to have any association at all.	3.642041296075448
16358. there is a vast	difference between the community of reconciliation which the new testament	describes and the community of congeniality found in the average	church building.	6.065727298449666
16359. whenever a congregation really sees itself	as a unit in the universal church in vital relation with the whole	body of christ and participating in his mission to the world a necessary	foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid.	3.58500472008082
16360. the	antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists.	6.678533193727039
16361. the	local and the ecumenical are one.	4.714065422372671
16362. of course the perspective	of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the	people of god will always be different from the perspective of those	who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a	particular place.	5.579316699327916
16363. each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related	to the other.	4.610816657823368
16364. neither is adequate if it stands alone.	7.683195234618801
16365. our difficulty	arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other.	4.138807422424663
16366. and this is what	all too often happens.	8.111083017348239
16367. a little parable	illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by professor	bela vasady at the end of the second world war.	3.7951299504742764
16368. with great	difficulty he made his way from his native hungary to geneva to renew	his contacts as a member of the provisional committee for the world	council of churches.	5.629213025096966
16369. when he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles	his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new	ones.	4.114804042696376
16370. he often spoke of them as his ecumenical	glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is	required in the church.	5.870538205911801
16371. it is he said a bifocal vision which can	see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a christian in right	relation to both.	3.5154542172216545
16372. as things stand now the local and the ecumenical	tend to compete with each other.	6.408668056538591
16373. on the one hand there are	ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter	with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church	is doing in their own town.	4.053310380130926
16374. they do not escape the pitfall into which	charles dickens pictured mrs jellyby as falling.	5.754195230753628
16375. her concern	for the natives of borrioboola-gha was so intense that she quite	forgot and neglected her son peepy! likewise the ecumenist may become	so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian	state in east germany the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary	china and the anguish of the church over apartheid in south	africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its	unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship pastoral service	and counseling and christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals.	3.2248700413945524
16376. on the other hand many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering	to the intimate personal needs of individuals in his congregation	that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social	responsibility and world mission.	5.349849949487151
16377. as a result they go on thinking	of the church with introverted and self-centered satisfaction only	in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families.	4.116172002648056
16378. it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of	the energy of most churches- whether in terms of finance or spiritual	concern- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the	members.	5.66300300041763
16379. the parish lives for itself rather than for the community or	the world.	3.785503747078024
16380. the gap between the ecumenical perspective and the	parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable	suburbs.	5.076769305577035
16381. it is eminently successful according to all conventional	standards.	4.403475842113875
16382. it is growing in numbers.	7.9232489283147025
16383. its people are agreeable	friends.	6.523233522459277
16384. it has a beautiful edifice.	9.888962891042357
16385. its preaching and its music give	refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain.	4.000285506043171
16386. it	provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled.	6.581910846387595
16387. it helps children	grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the bible.	4.454321305079185
16388. it draws	young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the	church from generation to generation.	6.460644966009253
16389. and it is easy for the ecumenical	enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is.	4.471850018501339
16390. but what	is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as christians	in the world?	5.35939813641578
16391.  all too often its conception of parish ministry	and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation	to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind.	3.9153685614313383
16392. it is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with	the mind of christ.	5.7091203138405815
16393. it is not helping them face the moral crisis	involved in the use of nuclear energy.	4.527802799668476
16394. it is not making them sensitive	to the sub-christian level of much of our economic and industrial	life.	6.050388267037764
16395. it is raising no disturbing question as to what christian stewardship	means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world	to economically underdeveloped peoples.	3.7153658437012793
16396. it is not developing an awareness	of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young	churches emerge in asia and africa.	5.658015609305238
16397. to put it bluntly many	a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want.	3.8074131102981146
16398. it is not disturbing them by thoughts of their christian responsibility	in relation to the world.	6.274961906444974
16399. we shall not make a decisive advance	in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not	merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of christian witness	and mission to the world.	3.8535886830148285
16400. there is a humorous but revealing	story about a rancher who owned a large slice of texas and who wanted	to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant	community.	5.4522276504042555
16401. he built a school and a library then a recreation center	and an inn.	3.827041113733803
16402. desiring to fill the only remaining lack he selected	the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting	it.	4.963634850063349
16403. a visitor to the beautiful little building inquired do	you belong to this church mr rancher?	3.634143242740943
16404.  why no ma'am	he replied this church belongs to me! the story reflects	the way too many people feel.	5.641861457528316
16405. as long as the congregation regards	the church as our church or the minister thinks of it as my	church just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant	advance.	3.986884251348469
16406. there must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs	not to us but to christ and that it is his purpose not our own interests	and preferences that determines what it is to be and do.	6.787741292896021
16407. embodiment of the whole	a local church which conceives its function	to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and	concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an	extra not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church.	3.2913100773933364
16408. it would	doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical	it is really failing to be the church of christ.	6.391048464259579
16409. yet the	truth according to the new testament is that every local church	has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in	that particular place.	4.056300337791588
16410. yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match	the boys from the neighboring farms; and buggies and wagons and chugging	fords kept gathering all morning until the edges of the field	were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field	to make fun of the visitors- whose pitcher was a formidable looking	young man with the only baseball cap.	4.655790172200154
16411. this was a bitterly	fought game carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight with no	friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness	that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls	that went into the crowd.	3.2430306823689192
16412. every pitch in the game brought forth	a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors	dropped	called forth yelps of derision.	5.06463775712125
16413. at	one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting	as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in	the kidneys he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled	over whether the ball was dead or the base runners were	free to score.	3.3363345705779506
16414. this was typical of such games which were earnestly	played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of	good fellowship.	5.356867111188009
16415. when the visitors after losing this game rode along	the village streets toward home the youngsters who could keep abreast	of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly you bunch of	hay-shakers! g'ahn back home! you hay-shakers!   baseball	was surely the national game in those days even though professional	baseball may have been merely a business.	3.219600715172641
16416. radio broadcasts had	not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home	in the town park or a pasture with perhaps two or three trips to the	city each season to see the cubs or the pirates or the indians or	the red sox.	5.027601102271024
16417. young men in school could look forward to playing	ball for money in a dozen different places even if they failed to	make the major leagues.	3.7167926597311505
16418. nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might	find a payday awaiting him in the three i league or the pony	league or the coastal plains league or the fast eastern league	if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere.	5.09027028513392
16419. even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams	sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores	that played two or three times a week throughout the summer usually in	the cool of the evening before an earnest and partisan audience who	did not begrudge a quarter each or even more to be dropped into a hat	when the game was half over.	3.2571985386150533
16420. babe ruth of course was everyone's	hero and everyone knew him even though relatively few ever	saw him play ball.	5.136050219019217
16421. his face was always in the newspapers sometimes	in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life.	3.961193224719456
16422. as the twenties grew	older and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more	and more people daily in the doings of the professionals the great	hitters overshadowed the game so that pitchers	were nearly of no account.	4.836568724394057
16423. boys no longer bothered learning to	bunt and even school kids scorned to choke up on a bat as willie	keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done.	3.243179276186003
16424. other	hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared	to dream of matching ruth who was still called jidge by all his	friends or leo or two-head by those who dared to taunt him	and who called most	of the world kid.	4.748225870494193
16425. lou gehrig was given the nickname buster	and he ran ruth a close race in home runs.	3.5904740203608667
16426. but the nickname never	stuck and gehrig was no match for ruth in color- which is sometimes	a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field.	4.935550020969687
16427. ruth	was a delinquent boy still but he was in every way a great ball	player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone	to do it.	3.6953626945220197
16428. a few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities	with the encouragement of the press so that they might	see their names in big black print along with daddy browning's	al capone's earl sande's and the prince of wales'.	4.9593184053766945
16429. one	who for a time succeeded	best and was still the sorriest of all was charles	arthur shires who called himself in the newspapers art the	great or the great shires.	3.783779653051495
16430. it was his brag that he could beat	everybody at anything but especially at fighting and he once took on	the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists.	5.08621006474822
16431. he was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond;	and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles	in art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the great first	baseman for some forgotten reason.	3.4641043832738085
16432. pegler wonder in print if art had worn this armament when he defeated	the sorry fact about this young man who was barely	of age when he broke into major-league baseball was that he really	was a better ball player than he was given credit for being- never so	good as he claimed and always an irritant to his associates but a	good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate	on his skills or cut up in public.	4.462803599036145
16433. in his minor way charles	arthur shires was perhaps more typical of his era than ruth was for	he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these	scott fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers.	3.2048998601493826
16434. there were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down;	or who ingested strange objects like live fish; or who undertook	to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor with or without	a partner; or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without	pausing for breath.	4.378851216284661
16435. one young man exhilarated to the point of insanity	by liquor and the excitement of the moment performed a perfect	swan dive out of the stands at the yale bowl during the yale-army	football game landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below	and died at once.	3.5611198161499598
16436. but the twenties were not all insanity and	a striving after recognition.	6.042703490770063
16437. the business of baseball began to prosper	along with other entertainments and performers- thanks partly to	george herman ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his	salary higher and higher- prospered too.	2.9095831405709673
16438. while fifty years before	albert goodwill spalding secretary of the chicago ball club of	the national league could write earnestly to the manager of the buffalo	club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball	game in august in this golden era a game at the yankee stadium	might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate.	5.066597860494973
16439. and	while less than ten years earlier the wayward black sox- all of them	top performers in their positions- had toiled for stingy charles	comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five	hundred dollars a year stars now were asking ten thousand dollars	twenty thousand dollars yes even fifty thousand dollars a season.	2.863727336611296
16440. the greatest team of this period was unquestionably the new	york yankees bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club	by men named ed barrow and miller huggins.	4.460003365864018
16441. boston fans sometimes	liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the	great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the red sox- sold to millionaires	huston and ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most	trifling desire.	3.8290348077486716
16442. ruth himself still owning his farm in massachusetts	and an interest in the massachusetts cigar business that printed	his round boyish face on the wrappers had led the parade down from fenway	park followed by pitchers carl mays leslie joe bush	waite hoyt herb pennock and sam jones catcher wally schang	third baseman joe dugan	and shortstop everett scott.	4.277237327505241
16443. by 1926 when	the mighty yanks were at their mightiest only a few of these were	left but they still shone brightest even beside able and agile rookies	like tony lazzeri	mark koenig lou gehrig george pipgras and	gray-thatched earl combs.	3.2665191352433327
16444. the deeds of this team through two seasons	and in the two world's series that followed have been written	and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said.	4.849646254000552
16445. but there	is one small episode that a few new york fans who happened to sit in	the cheap seats for one world's series game in 1926 like best to	recall.	3.350244695042361
16446. babe ruth as he always did in the stadium played right field	to avoid having the sun in his eyes and tommy thevenow a rather	mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the st louis cardinals	knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the	permanent stands and the wooden bleachers where ruth could not reach	it.	4.638308120617421
16447. the ball lay there shining white on the grass in view of nearly	every fan in the park while ruth red-necked with frustration charged	about the small patch of ground screaming where's the -ing	ball?	3.0893131232378557
16448.  but as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over	not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me so little tommy	ran all the way home.	5.675096021947942
16449. the ordinary man and woman however saw	little of the great professional games of those golden days or of	any other sporting event for that matter.	3.2627633127046805
16450. promoters always hastened	to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators	and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in	with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest	of any importance.	5.373684847613645
16451. radio broadcasts however- now that even plain	people could afford loud speakers on their sets- held old	fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones chiefly women	who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition	became first inured then attracted then addicted to the long	afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park.	2.8801241391497654
16452. in some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on	weekends the announcer was silenced and fans must needs drive to the	city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring.	4.964158698268917
16453. this had a pleasant effect upon the sunday gate receipts as well	as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies some of which began	to offer special excursion rates including seats at the park just	as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new.	3.064863601204351
16454. while women had always attended ball games in small numbers	part of a dead game sport in the early years of the twentieth	century to be taken out to the ball park and to root root root for	they had often sat in patient martyrdom unable even to	read the scoreboard which sometimes seemed to indicate that one	team	led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and	fifty-one.	5.0692866204264675
16455. the questions women asked at baseball games were standard	grist for amateur comedy as were the doings of women automobile drivers;	for every grown man	knew at least the fundamentals of baseball just	as every male american in this era liked to imagine that	he could fight with his fists.	2.9743288657014615
16456. and women were not expected to know	that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball.	5.9014447031790045
16457. radio however so increased the interest of women in the game	that it was hardly necessary even to have ladies' days any longer	to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home.	3.4917525858123977
16458. women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands where	they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice	stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears.	4.900127306244599
16459. the radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative	despite the baseball jargon that girls and women could begin to	store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics	that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their	lessons in school.	3.007272454670254
16460. this conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores	will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the ideal	and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for	preserving the ideal.	4.5173325376387305
16461. our discussion of this involves using	erik erikson's schema of identity vs identity diffusion	as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto	the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers	from whose case histories we quoted earlier.	2.9671732271427547
16462. our discussion does not	utilize all the identity crises postulated by erikson but is intended	to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying	unwed mothers.	4.908232565737355
16463. we hope thereby to emphasize that from a psychological	standpoint the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous	long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy	through adolescence.	3.493478611063657
16464. hypothesizing a series of developmental	stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old	age erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series	of identity crises.	5.116864099800266
16465. the successful and positive resolution of these	crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle- during	adolescence the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity	crisis depend to a considerable degree on his already having	resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy	childhood and early adolescence.	2.853080539850683
16466. within erikson's schema the	adolescent's delinquent behavior- in this case her unwed motherhood-	reflects her identity diffusion or her inability to resolve	these various identity crises positively.	5.027480946130255
16467. the adolescent	experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs time diffusion.	3.764953482249754
16468. time perspective- the ability to plan for the future and	to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range	objectives- is more easily developed if from infancy on the individual	has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which	she lives.	5.8585486429131794
16469. erikson has noted that unless this trust developed early	the time ambivalence experienced in varying degree and temporarily	by all adolescents	gratification of wants during childhood while not yet having fully	may develop	into a more permanent sense of time diffusion.	3.011742316293461
16470. experience of this time	diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate	urgency to act immediately.	5.799950499278181
16471. these polar extremes in time	diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported	in earlier chapters.	3.8350670405036738
16472. some of these mothers apparently feeling a	desperate urgency made on the spur of the moment commitments in love	and sex that would have life-long consequences.	5.535690600944514
16473. others displayed	utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future.	3.9627928305242084
16474. for many of these unwed mothers the data on their family life	and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources	of their	basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in	general.	5.620042528475065
16475. however as erickson has noted the individual's	failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood	need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of	identity diffusion in his adolescence.	3.335666605375184
16476. and as shown in chapter	6 some snp females originally developed such trust only	during their adolescence through the aid of and their identification	with alter-parents.	5.3486993400948135
16477. in the specific case of time diffusion we	must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust	when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by	most adolescents in our society and with the failure of	the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust.	3.50321462322102
16478. the adolescent experiences two closely related crises: self-certainty	vs an identity consciousness; and role-experimentation	vs negative identity.	4.568070230587944
16479. a sense of self-certainty and the freedom	to experiment with different roles or confidence in one's own unique	behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity is more easily	developed during adolescence if during early childhood the individual	was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some	autonomy.	3.037137213434863
16480. however if the child has been constantly surrounded	during nursery and early school age by peer groups; inculcated	with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards; and allowed	little initiative in early play and work patterns- then in adolescence	her normal degree of vanity sensitivity and preoccupation with	whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable will be compounded.	4.293048175007103
16481. her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions	and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence	are the manifestations in her adolescence of her having been indoctrinated	in childhood to feel shame if not guilt for failing to behave	in a manner acceptable to and judged by the performance of her nursery-	and elementary-school peer friends.	3.0148273763930646
16482. to be different is to invite	shame and doubt; and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's	parents who already consider one different and difficult to understand	than by one's peers who are also experiencing a similar groping	for and denial of adult status.	4.842079404217424
16483. the attitudes of some unwed	mothers quoted in chapter 2 revealed both considerable preoccupation	with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty.	3.170228059726984
16484. many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable	means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others; but	very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need	to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and	with one's self.	4.568061767619136
16485. another identity crisis confronting the	adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs work-paralysis.	4.038178542916547
16486. the adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise	the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends	on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy initiative and	self-discipline during childhood.	4.803220713079487
16487. the developmental process involves	the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement	resulting from having completed tasks having kept commitments	and having created something	dress of one's own design rather than in the design it ought	.	3.1647960671313227
16488. these childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty	that the adolescent needs for experimenting with many roles and	for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and	discovering her skills and abilities.	5.32397134018062
16489. if she has not had such	experiences the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will	be compounded.	3.936430090383749
16490. she may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted	with present and future alternatives- eg whether to prepare	primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker; whether	to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself	while attending school; whether to pursue a college education or a	job after high school; and whether to attend this or that college and	to follow this or that course of study.	4.708241114310284
16491. erikson has noted that as	this indecision mounts it may result in a paralysis of workmanship.	3.7783584940427155
16492. this paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting- and	never completing- many jobs tasks and courses of study; and in	the fact that she bases her decisions about work college carreer and	studies on what others are doing rather than on her own sense of identity	with given skills abilities likes and dislikes.	4.481474113767717
16493. the absence	during her childhood and early adolescence of experiences in developing	the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability- experiences	that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement-	and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy	and initiative in play and expression both tend in her adolescence	to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally	in experimenting.	2.8413160161174975
16494. the comments made by some unwed mothers	reflect this paralysis of workmanship.	5.172896016431143
16495. they	attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions	others made; they accepted a job primarily because it was available	convenient and paid reasonably.	3.5252467909281235
16496. these things both express and	at the same time continue contributing to their identity diffusion	in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and	self-certainty.	5.90504856429433
16497. as their identity diffusion increased they became more	susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs.	3.63536376514575
16498. these	affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities	containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship	no sense of dignity derived from a job well done.	5.156821350409037
16499. childhood	experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context	of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance	for the prevention of illegitimacy.	3.454962968134259
16500. the excerpts from case histories	presented above confirm this significance though through different	facets of experience.	4.471463326555969
16501. for example some unwed mothers had had no work	experiences household chores and responsibilities during childhood	and early adolescence; they subsequently occupied their leisure hours	in searching for something exciting and diverting.	3.236486103288527
16502. on	the other hand some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility	imposed on them at an early age and had thus had so little freedom	or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative that their work	and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens- to be escaped	and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden	sexual behavior.	4.663951216890161
16503. the adolescent also faces the identity	crisis that erikson has termed ideological polarization vs diffusion	of ideals.	3.15540604288166
16504. in discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations	for the prevention of illegitimacy we shall again superimpose	erikson's concept on our data.	5.167911120269649
16505. adolescents have a much-discussed	tendency to polarize ideas and values to perceive things as	either-or black or white- nuances of meaning are relatively	unimportant.	3.1798949730716517
16506. this tendency is perhaps most clearly revealed in the	literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents.	5.117586985914995
16507. erikson	has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily	resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly	changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood.	3.1410381935783933
16508. it provides identification- with an idea a value a cause that	cuts through or even transcends the multiple and ambivalent identities	of their passage from child to adult and permits their forceful	and overt expression of emotion.	4.659199268665206
16509. the positive development during	adolescence of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with	increasing independence and to identify overtly either with or against	given ideas values and practices depends to a considerable degree	on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy	initiative and self-certainty.	3.0381706478906927
16510. most adolescents have some ideological	diffusion at various developmental stages as they experience a proliferation	of ideas and values.	5.524345192796912
16511. the diffusion is most pronounced and	most likely to become fixed however in those who have had no or very	minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could	have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources	of developing self-certainty.	3.330710791767683
16512. a pronounced ideological	diffusion- ie inability to identify independently with given	ideas and value systems- is reflected in many ways.	4.899804395904138
16513. for example	it is evinced by the adolescent whose beliefs and actions	represent primarily his rebellion and reaction again the ideas and behavior	patterns of others rather than his inner conviction and choice.	3.173187051332121
16514. it is mirrored by the individual willie lohmans whose ideas and	behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide	with those of the individual or group present and most important	at the moment.	5.103226803259846
16515. in another sense it is represented in the arguments	of the true believers who seek to disprove the validity of all	other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs.	3.5778723319790453
16516. the case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological	diffusion embodied in the unwed mother's inability to identify	independently with a given value system or behavior pattern and	her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility	for her sexual behavior.	4.379131806793119
16517. for example the unwed mothers expressed	their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly what	it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly.	3.579536938196706
16518. they were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital	sexual intercourse.	6.459694642670215
16519. they condemned the movie script writers for implying	that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating.	3.574511463561407
16520. they criticized parents	for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong;	and they censured parents who never disciplined and were too permissive	or who never explained how easy it was to get pregnant.	4.840171678713997
16521. in the adult world there are a number of rather general and	diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the	adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis.	3.508406009220885
16522. for example some contemporary writing tends to fuse the good	guys and the bad guys to portray the weak people as heroes and	weakness as a virtue and to explain asocial behavior	by attributing it to deterministic psychological familial and social	experiences.	4.651036900815213
16523. in the final accounting these would have augmented the bill for both	sides.	4.215330085570101
16524. an estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive.	6.640711223470665
16525. yet the huge amount of money consumed by the selden litigation	which many regarded as wasteful indirectly contributed to constructive	changes in legal procedure.	3.7787308104148143
16526. the duration and other circumstances	of the selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of	patent infringement actions.	5.22348428909712
16527. the suit as we have seen came before	the courts when patent attorneys inventors and laymen were making mounting	demands for reforms in the american patent system.	3.2984994652192765
16528. chief among	the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures	in equity.	5.385245736842853
16529. in a long and angry footnote to his opinion	judge hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism.	3.86917103364231
16530. it is a duty said hough not to let pass this opportunity	of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony	in equity current in this circuit excused	if not justified by the rules of the supreme court especially to	be found in patent causes and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation.	4.872743240889382
16531. as long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition	rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer	i fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged and expensive	prolixity remain the best known characteristic of equity.	3.258279397868236
16532. observing	that reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible	examples hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing	procedures.	5.010389150621735
16533. he cited the elephantine dimensions of the selden case	record; the duplication of testimony and exhibits; the numerous	squabbles over minor matters; the objections stated at outrageous	length; and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts uncalled	for and	unjustifiable from the retort discourteous to the lie direct.	2.9268850803060924
16534. the fundamental difficulty of which the selden case was	a striking example concluded hough will	remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial	officer present and responsible for the maintenance of discipline	and the reception or exclusion of testimony.	4.931115298868617
16535. not least	among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment	were those who had participated in the selden suit.	4.268960767706545
16536. william a	redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under	rules of evidence the testimony would have been completed in sixty	days instead of five years.	5.93606653477725
16537. inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for	reform inevitably centering upon the selden litigation as a horrible	example.	3.4180581981666016
16538. its costive deliberations were likened to those of	the british courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by dickens in	bleak house.	4.839575407599932
16539. parker who agreed with much of this criticism	did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects.	3.8036644286035055
16540. but	he felt that the selden case was being unfairly pilloried.	7.317759523152925
16541. in a detailed	letter published in the scientific american in 1912 he	remarked that loose statements about the case showed scant understanding	of the facts.	3.5004525307855765
16542. the suit although commonly designated as a single	action actually embraced five cases.	5.007220697369327
16543. parker insisted that the size	of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable	duplication of testimony.	4.125781265766567
16544. in a private communication written	in 1911 parker had been more to the point.	6.539586221807887
16545. noting the complaints	of inventors and members of the patent bar he admitted that some	of the strictures were fairly well founded but he added that under	existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group	of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent.	3.3801191229993686
16546. the	vast industrial interests caught up in the selden suit as well as the	complex character of the automotive art encouraged both sides to exploit	every possible chance for or against the patent said parker.	5.608918867338761
16547. this very seldom happens in this class or in other cases and	of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the	record beyond what ordinarily would occur.	3.7137023429271165
16548. parker listed the	remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony.	5.787095499139611
16549. the most important of these found him in agreement with hough's	plea for reform.	3.999628684369061
16550. parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate	or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court	who had no authority to limit testimony.	5.239285140250904
16551. the taking of depositions	he suggested should be placed under a special court examiner empowered	to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial	testimony.	3.0650215839472676
16552. i am satisfied that in the selden case had this power	existed and this course been pursued it would have shortened	the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of	the other witnesses thereto more than that.	5.608190442548964
16553. in the end hough's	acidulous protest which parker called the now somewhat famous	note on this 'selden' case did not go unheeded.	3.7037566336129624
16554. in 1912	the united states supreme court adopted a new set of rules of equity	which became effective on february 1 1913.	5.244752798369737
16555. the revised procedure	was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform.	3.4117743028360628
16556. under the new rules testimony	is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary	character.	5.806228853895854
16557. other expeditious methods are designed to prevent	prolixity limit delays and reduce the expense of infringement suits.	4.015639508750032
16558. one of the alam lawyers observed that if the selden	case had been tried under this simplified procedure the testimony	which filled more than a score of volumes at a minimum cost of $1	a page for publication alone could have been contained in one volume.	5.363092773879613
16559. while patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive	forms of litigation these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums	of money.	3.5529357396932286
16560. there is little doubt that they were promulgated by the supreme	court as a direct result of the selden patent suit.	7.000707510419698
16561. even	before it was formally dissolved in 1912 the alam	was succeeded by the automobile board of trade the direct lineal	ancestor of the present-day automobile manufacturers association.	3.294930902877064
16562. the trade bodies which came in the wake of the alam	were more representative for they never adopted a policy of exclusion.	5.196668651280141
16563. nevertheless it is from the selden organization that the industry	inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests	of the trade.	3.6026349774308
16564. one of the chief features of this community of interest	is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement a milestone	in the development of american industrial cooperation.	5.753152096159365
16565. its origin	lies in the selden patent controversy and its aftermath.	4.751469521741797
16566. from	the earliest days of the motor car industry before the alam	was established patent infringement loomed as a serious and	vexing problem.	5.581668887883709
16567. many patent contests were waged over automobile components	and accessories among them tires detachable rims ball bearings	license brackets and electric horns.	3.2031371881358592
16568. the fluidity and momentum of	the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims.	4.598935935412616
16569. as	early as 1900 a wall street combination acquired detail patents with	the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers.	3.2301006819022695
16570. this scheme failed and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement	suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest	in 1912.	5.186444520123566
16571. in this tangle of conflicting claims the patent-sharing	scheme adopted by the alam at its founding proved	to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant	litigation.	3.32450919986775
16572. the interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty	eliminated infringement suits among the members of the alam	patent pool	and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive	technology.	4.631664542249567
16573. one of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition	upon the withholding of patent rights among alam members.	4.159706786766306
16574. within its limits this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics	of a cross-licensing agreement.	5.623485651975053
16575. its positive features	outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly.	4.488836730950937
16576. since the alam holdings embraced only about twenty-five	per cent of motor vehicle patents the denial of rights to independent	companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors	of the industry.	4.695319014345313
16577. the highly important dyer patents on the sliding	gear transmission were held by the alam pool.	3.4019704695606614
16578. but henry	ford used the planetary transmission in his model t and earlier	cars and in 1905 as a precautionary measure took out a license	from the man who claimed to be its inventor.	4.9061608755132164
16579. for those affiliated	with it the alam pool was a haven from the infringement	actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting	intensity after 1900.	3.53273962862416
16580. by 1910 the courts were crowded with cases	many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions.	5.0846242150966505
16581. it was commonplace for auto makers parts-suppliers and dealers	to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their	daily mail.	3.282383122869506
16582. purely from the business man's standpoint and without	regard to the lawyer's view commented a trade journal the	matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing	some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents	are to become weapons of warfare in business instead of simple beneficient	protection devices for encouraging inventive creation.	4.3177922709400685
16583. occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain	prospect of legal complications.	3.909676483437474
16584. one manufacturer who held an allegedly	basic patent said: i would readily put over $50000 into the	manufacture of the device but it is so easy to make that we would enter	immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would	eat up all our profits.	5.105983500078196
16585. the prevailing view in the industry was	summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a senate committee:	the exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions	including delays surrounding legal disputes particularly in patent	litigation are items of industrial burden which must be written	large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste.	3.0620193270101046
16586. by that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping	constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical	information.	5.372726647090603
16587. at this point charles c hanch long an advocate	of patent peace in the industry became chairman of the patents committee	of the national automobile chamber of commerce successor	to the automobile board of trade.	3.779844553900879
16588. hanch was treasurer of the nordyke	+ marmon company an indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling	machinery before producing the marmon car in 1904.	4.644010924405833
16589. he had	first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety	per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's.	3.906608614027916
16590. anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry	hanch went to detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading	alam members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan.	4.908990733817563
16591. the breach created by the selden patent doomed his proposal but hanch	did not abandon his scheme.	3.47477148482545
16592. after the demise of the alam	the time was propitious for establishing such a pool.	5.850333840669747
16593. most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal	interchange of patents.	3.818621619023395
16594. it is a much easier course to agree to	let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned said	a trade authority than to continue the costly effort of straightening	the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system	which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day.	4.838362874901303
16595. with the other members of the patents committee- wilfred c leland	howard e coffin windsor t white and w h	vandervoort- hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential	feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution.	3.3346212223281406
16596. the	plan was supported by frederick p fish counsel for the national	automobile chamber of commerce.	5.348789214531366
16597. it will be recalled that in his	summation for the alam before judge hough fish had	condemned patent litigation as the curse of the american industrial	community.	4.0084993781464044
16598. he was well aware that some inventors and their allies used	their patents solely for nuisance value.	5.6614453248814165
16599. my personal view is that	not one patented invention in ten is worth making he later told	a congressional committee.	3.5107187061271996
16600. the eloquent persuasions of fish guaranteed	the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association.	5.6291700155469995
16601. drawn up in 1914 the cross-licensing agreement became	effective in 1915.	4.073896138262311
16602. it remained in force for ten years and has been	renewed at five-year intervals since 1925.	6.089502016418853

16621. here	is one of the loveliest fountains in rome the fontana delle	tartarughe or it's typical	of rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find	such an artistic work in the center of a little square.	3.9725874463770827

16635. when you stand before	the barrel-vaulted you have the impression that the statue	at	the end is at a considerable distance yet it is actually only a few	feet away.	4.197734782601829
16636. the sense of perspective has been created by designing the	length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade	are much shorter than those in front.	5.262924919378595
16637. the gardens of the palazzo	shaded by a huge magnolia tree are most attractive.	3.5249948697475926
16638. the courtyard	is magnificently decorated.	5.906714851330074
16639. from the palazzo spada you continue	another block along the via capo di ferro and vicolo de venti	to the imposing begun in 1514 and considered	by many to be the finest palace of all.	3.342889894541486
16640. michelangelo was the most distinguished	of several noted architects who helped design it.	5.7073765868409545

16649. your	first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains	its two churches that almost face each other and its russet-colored	buildings is a sense of restful spaciousness- particularly	welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have	followed since starting this walk.	3.125248158141207
16650. the site of the oblong	piazza is which was probably used	for horse and chariot races.	5.177503842842219
16651. for centuries it was the location of historic	festivals and open-air sports events.	4.538821356686945
16652. from the seventeenth to	the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in	the summer and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated	square in their carriages.	5.316038460280569
16653. giovanni bernini's fountain	of the rivers in the center of the piazza is built around	a roman obelisk from the circus of maxentius which rests on grottoes	and rocks with four huge figures one at each corner denoting four	great rivers from different continents- the danube the ganges the	nile and the plate.	2.9385718114077988
16654. the eyes of the figure of the nile are covered	perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure	from her sight the baroque facade of the church of sant' agnese	in agone the work of bernini's rival borromini.	5.075547110296733
16655. in the piazza navona there are many delightful cafes where you can	sit have a drink or lunch and watch the fountains in the square.	3.634424294527681
16656. the	scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about	rome.	5.680897405451733

16663. this circular edifice constructed by	agrippa in bc 27 was rebuilt in its present shape by the emperor	hadrian.	3.423712519717028
16664. it was dedicated as a church in the seventh century.	7.482012245813751
16665. as you pause in the piazza by the egyptian obelisk brought from the	temple of isis you will admire the pantheon's impressive corinthian	columns.	3.63175775565538
16666. the pantheon's interior still in its original	form is truly majestic and an architectural triumph.	4.769746464506187
16667. its	forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from	the floor to the ceiling.	3.7328913977774634
16668. the only means of interior light is the	twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous standing	before the tomb of raphael the great genius of the renaissance when	shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great roman temple you are	once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of	rome.	4.418471259043464
16669. as you leave the pantheon take the narrow street to	the right the via del seminario a block to	one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city.	3.8345511400151326
16670. there about one hundred yards on your right you pass a simple restaurant	the curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church	seems like a stage set.	5.647341224871008
16671. this is one of the most charming little	squares in this part of rome.	5.05781843670742
16672. one block along the via de burro	will bring you to the in	the old a few yards farther on the via	dei bergamaschi is the the great column from	which the square takes its name was erected by the emperor marcus	aurelius.	5.094732687478707
16673. you are now at the though narrow one	of rome's busiest streets.	4.853716901685119
16674. horse races took place here in the middle	ages.	7.054767130420442
16675. if you have taken this stroll in the morning and you have	the time and inclination walk to the right along the crowded corso	for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings-	mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries- in the	.	3.757044566903832
16676. here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where	the family still lives.	7.096595205967451
16677. otherwise cross over the corso and	walk a block or so to the left.	4.182832964826315
16678. you will come to a	delightful though moderately expensive restaurant which is particularly	noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries.	5.369192046613868
16679. either here or in one of the modest restaurants nearby is just the	to the spanish	the second walk through the heart of rome should be taken	after lunch so that you will reach the when	the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best.	3.6913090998200904
16680. rare indeed is the harlem citizen from the most circumspect church	member to the most shiftless adolescent who does not have a long tale	to tell of police incompetence injustice or brutality.	5.445947962918029
16681. i myself	have witnessed and endured it more than once.	4.206586580375881
16682. the businessmen and racketeers	also have a story.	5.42561989034822
16683. and so do the prostitutes.	6.300252867972266
16684. perhaps the place to discuss harlem's very complex attitude toward	black policemen nor the reasons according to harlem that they	it is hard on the other hand to blame	the policeman blank good-natured thoughtless and insuperably	innocent for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves.	5.2949408504187065
16685. he too believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended	when they are not taken for the deed.	3.8320964840658407
16686. he has never himself done	anything for which to be hated- which of us has?	6.434871672477267
16687. - and yet he is	facing daily and nightly people who would gladly see him dead and he	knows it.	3.4069003149801276
16688. there is no way for him not to know it: there are few things	under heaven more unnerving than the silent accumulating contempt	and hatred of a people.	5.280874147665009
16689. he moves through harlem therefore like	an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country; which is precisely	what and where he is and is the reason he walks in twos and threes.	3.48472385694273
16690. and he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company:	the people who are watching him know why too.	7.243420775505316
16691. any street meeting	sacred or secular which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as	its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white	domination.	3.3633922768302553
16692. and these days of course in terms increasingly vivid and	jubilant it speaks of the end of that domination.	6.995751755635635
16693. the white policeman	standing on a harlem street corner finds himself at the very center	of the revolution now occurring in the world.	3.508213796979638
16694. he is not prepared	for it- naturally nobody is- and what is possibly much more to the	point he is exposed as few white people are to the anguish of the	black people around him.	5.168630591642728
16695. even if he is gifted with the merest mustard	grain of imagination something must seep in.	4.336123641513875
16696. he cannot avoid observing	that some of the children in spite of their color remind him of	children he has known and loved perhaps even of his own children.	6.205380929765935
16697. he	knows that he certainly does not want his children living this	way.	4.000017190458958
16698. he can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction: into	a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature.	5.348922988927754
16699. he becomes more	callous the population becomes more hostile the situation grows	more tense and the police force is increased.	3.5602913754746734
16700. one day to everyone's	astonishment someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything	blows up.	5.778591608618741
16701. before the dust has settled or the blood congealed editorials	speeches and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land demanding	to know what happened.	3.537490198625065
16702. what happened is that negroes want to	be treated like men.	6.758463591908693
16703. negroes want to be treated like men:	a perfectly straightforward statement containing only seven words.	3.92801399439856
16704. people who have mastered kant hegel shakespeare marx freud	and the bible find this statement utterly impenetrable.	5.486704624569265
16705. the idea seems	to threaten profound barely conscious assumptions.	3.889919853556118
16706. a kind of panic	paralyzes their features as though they found themselves trapped on	the edge of a steep place.	5.8054267210218535
16707. i once tried to describe to a very well-known	american intellectual the conditions among negroes in the south.	4.015434578845116
16708. my recital disturbed him and made him indignant; and he asked me	in perfect innocence why don't all the negroes in the south	move north?	5.411942200244141
16709.  i tried to explain what has happened unfailingly	whenever a significant body of negroes move north.	3.862152443274587
16710. they do not	escape jim crow: they merely encounter another not-less-deadly	variety.	6.112754432028899
16711. they do not move to chicago they move to the south side;	they do not move to new york they move to harlem.	4.489983724672288
16712. the pressure	within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand and this expansion	is always violent.	4.732011973964902
16713. white people hold the line as long as they can	and in as many ways as they can from verbal intimidation to physical	violence.	3.995039008058031
16714. but inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from	the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto.	6.5164631648776234
16715. the white	people fall back bitterly before the black horde; the landlords make	a tidy profit by raising the rent chopping up the rooms and all but	dispensing with the upkeep; and what has once been a neighborhood	turns into a turf.	2.925741103053496
16716. this is precisely what happened when the puerto	ricans arrived in their thousands- and the bitterness thus caused	is as i write being fought out all up and down those streets.	5.389523411105225
16717. northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury.	4.555888573136825
16718. they seem	to feel that because they fought on the right side during the civil	war and won they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going	on in the south without taking any responsibility for it; and	that they can ignore what is happening in northern cities because what	is happening in little rock or birmingham is worse.	4.924393196304487
16719. well in the	first place it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both	to know which is worse.	4.567130617741823
16720. i know negroes who prefer the south and	white southerners because at least there you haven't got to	play any guessing games! the guessing games referred to have driven	more than one negro into the narcotics ward the madhouse or the	river.	4.573211798161082
16721. i know another negro a man very dear to me who says with	conviction and with truth the spirit of the south is the spirit	of america.	4.2803664221262965
16722. he was born in the north and did his military training	in the south.	7.736886880585637
16723. he did not as far as i can gather find the south	worse; he found it if anything all too familiar.	4.478846310351083
16724. in the	second place though even if birmingham is worse no doubt	johannesburg south africa beats it by several miles and buchenwald	was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history	of the world.	5.2183264949995225
16725. the world has never lacked for horrifying examples;	but i do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification	for our own crimes.	4.093227996428566
16726. this perpetual justification empties	the heart of all human feeling.	6.26797102766544
16727. the emptier our hearts become the greater	will be our crimes.	3.37315422152803
16728. thirdly the south is not merely an embarrassingly	backward region but a part of this country and what happens	there concerns every one of us.	6.718826034505889
16729. as far as the color problem	is concerned there is but one great difference between the southern	white and the northerner: the southerner remembers historically and	in his own psyche a kind of eden in which he loved black people and	they loved him.	3.6175624023417012
16730. historically the flaming sword laid across this eden	is the civil war.	5.7385130481610584
16731. personally it is the southerner's sexual	coming of age when without any warning unbreakable taboos are set	up between himself and his past.	3.7895702315514668
16732. everything thereafter is permitted	him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need.	5.887639467915207
16733. the resulting	indescribable torment affects every southern mind and is the	basis of the southern hysteria.	3.3823854690027817
16734. none of this is true for the	northerner.	9.67236967465885
16735. negroes represent nothing to him personally except perhaps	the dangers of carnality.	3.9966197925170497
16736. southerners	see them all the time.	7.269778457053777
16737. northerners never think about them whereas southerners	are never really thinking of anything else.	3.704114745994557
16738. negroes are	therefore ignored in the north and are under surveillance in the south	and suffer hideously in both places.	5.889560496897064
16739. neither the southerner nor	the northerner is able to look on the negro simply as a man.	4.497870802544773
16740. it seems	to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the negro be	considered either as a kind of ward	negroes comparatively bought cadillacs last year and how few	comparatively	or as a victim	that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our	.	5.315404316675217
16741. they are two sides of the same coin and the south will not change-	cannot change- until the north changes.	4.607267514019311
16742. the country will	not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really	means by freedom.	4.999667097034195
16743. in the meantime generations keep being born bitterness	is increased by incompetence pride and folly and the world shrinks	around us.	3.6256374694504334
16744. it is a terrible an inexorable law that one	cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own:	in the face of one's victim one sees oneself.	4.937169340565047
16745. walk through the	streets of harlem and see what we this nation have become.	3.9872211194559717
16746. river downtown: postscript to a letter from harlem	the	fact that american negroes rioted in the un while adlai	stevenson was addressing the assembly shocked and baffled most white	americans.	4.9740886417108445
16747. stevenson's speech and the spectacular disturbance	in the gallery were both touched off by the death in katanga the	day before of patrice lumumba.	3.575612900896579
16748. stevenson stated in the course of	his address that the united states was against colonialism.	7.523345231358331
16749. god	knows what the african nations who hold 25 per cent of the voting	stock in the un were thinking- they may for example have	been thinking of the us abstention when the vote on algerian	freedom was before the assembly- but i think i have a fairly accurate	notion of what the negroes in the gallery were thinking.	3.688464568382214
16750. i had	intended to be there myself.	8.075782106405562
16751. it was my first reaction upon hearing	of lumumba's death.	4.424746718925652
16752. i was curious about the impact of this political	assassination on negroes in harlem for lumumba had- has- captured	the popular imagination there.	5.3018408085287385
16753. i was curious to know if lumumba's	death which is surely among the most sinister of recent events	would elicit from our side anything more than the usual well-meaning	rhetoric.	3.9082395418928306
16754. and i was curious about the african reaction.	8.339707482873056
16755. however the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the un	gallery.	4.33759354105265
16756. had i been there i too in the eyes of most americans	would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the communists.	6.136817882078036
16757. the	climate and the events of the last decade and the steady pressure of	the cold war have given americans yet another means of avoiding	self-examination and so it has been decided that the riots were communist	inspired.	3.745022036464875
16758. nor was it long naturally before prominent	negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the un rioters	do not represent the real feeling of the negro community.	5.481086731545983
16759. according then to what i take to be the prevailing view these rioters	were merely a handful of irresponsible stalinist-corrupted provocateurs.	4.307182121544686
16760. i find this view amazing.	8.649198828951885
16761. it is a view which even	a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict.	3.8958886472837237
16762. one	has only for example to walk through harlem and ask oneself two questions.	5.830054860350442
16763. the first question is: would i like to live here?	4.606321926501474
16764. 	and the second question is: why don't those who now live here move	out?	5.3248014551514276
16765.  the answer to both questions is immediately obvious.	4.681655508005387
16766. unless	one takes refuge in the theory- however disguised- that negroes	are somehow different from white people i do not see how one can	escape the conclusion that the negro's status in this country is	not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability.	4.995748547943288
16767. now	i do not doubt that among the people at the un that day there	were stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the	most cynical motives.	3.4968035911167914
16768. wherever there is great social discontent these	people are sooner or later to be found.	5.570034543920253
16769. their presence is not as	frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity.	3.826152684516714
16770. what	i find appalling- and really dangerous- is the american assumption	that the negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical	agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest.	5.081544899399942
16771. it is a notion	which contains a gratuitous insult implying as it does that negroes	can make no move unless they are manipulated.	3.6926838591433
16772. color was delayed until 1935 the wide screen until the early fifties.	5.6859504111148125
16773. movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction	of the primitive movies of the nineties.	3.827535390799595
16774. each film consisted of fifty	feet which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen.	5.814612573547342
16775. as long as audiences came to see the movement there seemed little reason	to adventure further.	4.53982576585839
16776. motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores	in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can	still be found in such urban areas as times square.	5.672046094354035
16777. brief snips of	actual events were shown: parades dances street scenes.	3.667999156745627
16778. the sensational	and frightening enjoyed popularity: a train rushes straight at	the audience or a great wave threatens to break over the seats.	4.560386975380675
16779. an	early edison production was the execution of mary queen of scots.	3.785488146510554
16780. the unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold; the headsman swung	his axe; the head dropped off; end of film.	4.465427467978498
16781. an early film by	a competitor of the wizard of menlo park simply showed a long kiss	performed by two actors of the contemporary stage.	3.451992442899374
16782. in the field	of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective	as audience boredom and the first decade of the new device was not over	before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded	one-minute shows.	5.442544403389198
16783. in response the industry allowed the discovery	of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies	the essential form they have had to this day.	3.9132698174763885
16784. despite the sheer	beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries art films and travelogues	despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development	as cinerama the movies are at heart a form of fiction like the	play the novel or the short story.	5.053318252629427
16785. moreover the most artistically	successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative	form from the fiction feature.	3.565946190458511
16786. thus such great american documentaries	as the river and the plow that broke the plains	were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures.	5.1627150013379
16787. the discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early	years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men a french	magician georges melies and an american employee of edison edwin	s porter.	3.6247600356683494
16788. of the two porter is justly the better known for	he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the	first step toward fashioning a language of film toward making the motion	picture the intricate efficient time machine that it has remained	since even in the most inept hands.	5.243262995839179
16789. melies however out of his professional instincts as a magician	discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain	part of the vocabulary of film.	3.6988061899141074
16790. one of these is the dissolve	which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene.	6.029373877814694
16791. as the first scene begins to fade the succeeding scene begins	to appear.	4.339304977463066
16792. for a moment or two both scenes are present simultaneously	one growing weaker one growing stronger.	5.885494979193243
16793. in a series of fairy tales	and fantasies melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped	to tell a straightforward story with beginning middle and end complications	resolutions climaxes and conclusions.	3.394207345340816
16794. immediately the	film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content	based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time.	5.034113540397289
16795. physically a movie is possible because a series of images is projected	one at a time at such a speed that the eye remembers the one	that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing.	3.5550578585983272
16796. linking	the smoothly changing images together the eye itself endows them	with the illusion of movement.	5.159740533763365
16797. the projection time of painting	and sculpture is highly subjective varying from person to person and	even varying for a given person on different occasions.	3.2230697870414153
16798. so is the time	of the novel.	8.510561828755387
16799. the drama in the theater and the concert in the hall	both have a fixed time but the time is fixed by the director and the	players the conductor and the instrumentalists subject therefore	to much variation as record collectors well know.	3.2288969895828603
16800. the time of the motion	picture is fixed absolutely.	6.9279341737278965
16801. the film consists of a series of still	transparent photographs or frames 35-mm-wide.	3.815868852478173
16802. each frame	comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected	on the screen at the rate for silent movies of 16 frames per second	and for sound films 24 frames per second.	5.0832110538960045
16803. this is the rate of projection;	it is also the rate of photographing.	5.30458425452656
16804. time is built into	the motion picture which cannot exist without time.	6.339202564788142
16805. now time is also	the concern of the fictional narrative which is at its simplest	the story of an action with usually a beginning a middle and an end-	elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence.	3.561494628258594
16806. the moving picture of the train or the wave coming at the	audience is to be sure more intense than a still picture of the same	subject but the difference is really one of degree; the cinematic	element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which	would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo.	4.9428333807448555
16807. in narrative	time is essential as it is in film.	5.4120016671960745
16808. almost everything about the	movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created	and maintained between narrative time and film time.	5.0845038506965095
16809. this discovery	of melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling	magician's tricks produced on film.	3.601281553623482
16810. it was porter however	who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the	half century of film history that has since ensued.	5.102450338298521
16811. the movie was the	great train robbery and its effects on the young industry and	art were all but incalculable.	3.437049094190217
16812. overnight for one thing porter's	film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten.	6.0047318513969765
16813. the	great train robbery is a one-reel film.	4.809866251337277
16814. one reel- from eight to	twelve minutes- became the standard length from the year of robbery	1903 until griffith shattered that limit forever with birth of	a nation in 1915.	4.731770809497988
16815. the reel itself became and still is the standard	of measure for the movies.	3.426776813993932
16816. the material of the porter film	is simplicity itself; much of it has continued to be used over the	years and the heart of it- good guys and bad guys in the old west-	pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's.	5.452555255399199
16817. a	band of robbers enters a railroad station overpowers and ties up the	telegraph operator holds up the train and escapes.	3.3181383173846672
16818. a posse is formed	and pursues the robbers who having made their escape are whooping	it up with some wild wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out.	4.602522245175523
16819. the robbers	run from the hide-out take cover in a wooded declivity and are shot	dead by the posse.	3.106502593441713
16820. as a finale is appended a close-up of one of the	band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience.	5.658899826992854
16821. all this is simple enough but in telling the story porter did	two important things that had not been done before.	4.2866154100786265
16822. each scene is shot	straight through as had been the universal custom from a camera fixed	in a single position but in the outdoor scenes especially in the	capture and destruction of the outlaws porter's camera position	breaks necessarily with the camera position standard until then which	had been roughly that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at	a play.	4.863736356660671
16823. the plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the	plane of the film in the camera or on the screen.	4.200535681561159
16824. if the change at	first sight seems minor we may recall that it took the italian painters	about two hundred years to make an analogous change and the italian	painters by universal consent were the most brilliant group of	geniuses any art has seen.	4.95781996966401
16825. in that apparently simple shift porter	opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of	art as well as a mechanical recording device.	4.48914063828991
16826. he did more than	that.	9.723790422156965
16827. he revealed the potential value of the cut as the basic	technique in the art of the film.	4.322242451283134
16828. cutting of course takes place automatically	in the creation of a film.	6.150171331158075
16829. the meaning of the word is quite	physical to begin with.	4.508165468282879
16830. the physical film is cut with a knife at the	end of one complete sequence and the cut edge is joined physically	by cement to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence.	5.353067043153037
16831. if	as a home movie maker you shoot the inevitable footage of your child	taking its first steps you have merely recorded an historical event.	3.1840767528742027
16832. if in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends	you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's	grandmother watching this event you have begun to be an artist in	film; you are employing the basic technique of film; you are cutting.	5.001412935738304
16833. this is what porter did.	6.367350921754556
16834. as the robbers leave the looted	train the film suddenly cuts back to the station where the telegrapher's	little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only	to find him bound on the floor.	5.021847105423565
16835. she dashes around in alarm.	5.215488607030812
16836. the two	events are taking place at the same time.	6.806930521138561
16837. time and space have both become	cinematic.	5.611448176857455
16838. we leap from event to event- including the formation	of the posse- even though the events in reality are taking	place not in sequence but simultaneously and not near each other but	at a considerable distance.	4.840491133619685
16839. the chase as a standard film	device probably dates from the great train robbery and there	is a reason for the continued popularity of the device.	3.5205908051873513
16840. the chase in	itself is a narrative; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands	cutting- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage	of the journey of both.	4.269981017788626
16841. the simple naked idea of one man chasing another	is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other	form of fiction.	3.691421205582873
16842. the cowboy films the cops and robbers films and	the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not	only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence;	these films and these sequences are also seeking out- instinctively	or by design- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative.	4.250182939941654
16843. there	still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full	potential of the new form and to make it an art.	4.551357934208036
16844. the man was dw	griffith.	8.143747309958542
16845. when he came to the movies- more or less by accident-	they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking	for an idle few minutes.	3.7701580376643764
16846. in about seven years griffith either	invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource	at the disposal of the film maker.	5.237778247354649
16847. before he was forty griffith	had created the art of the film.	4.9081720569203835
16848. not that there had not been	attempts mostly european to do exactly that.	6.805158849030802
16849. but in general the european	efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly	emerging language of the film itself.	4.517915150352603
16850. staggeringly condensed versions	of famous novels and famous plays were presented.	5.235221313790219
16851. great actors	and actresses- the most notable being sarah bernhardt- were hired	to repeat their stage performances before the camera.	3.314090966246622
16852. in all of this	extensive and expensive effort the camera was downgraded to the status	of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor	or by the author.	5.180911582054445
16853. the phonograph today for all its high fidelity	and stereophonic sound is precisely what the early art purveyors in	the movies wished to make of the camera.	3.264649503134381
16854. not surprisingly this approach	did not work.	7.659046401134299
16855. the effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques	in the early years of the century and some interesting records	of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names.	3.3858758913147953
16856. but no art	at all was born of the art effort in the early movies.	7.640525736229979
16857. in general religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis;	congregational membership however is another thing.	4.192607318420068
16858. a congregation	survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership;	that is when it can preserve economic integration.	5.19277232363206
16859. religious	faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in	a congregation since the decision to join a worshiping group requires	some motive force but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining;	the presence of other members of similar social and economic	level is the sufficient condition.	3.3853508948627455
16860. the breakdown of social	homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account	for the decline of central city churches.	4.883603313949002
16861. central cities reveal	two adverse features for the major denominations: central cities	tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes; central	cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition.	3.3681076555445197
16862. the central	city areas in other words exhibit the two characteristics which	violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations:	they have too few middle-class people; they mix middle-class people	with lower-class residents.	4.657887359978665
16863. central city areas have become progressively	poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus	of middle-class people from most central cities.	3.6092579853938114
16864. with few exceptions	the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central	city.	6.083483052642206
16865. the key to protestant development therefore is economic	integration of the nucleus of the congregation.	3.6922116039701174
16866. members of higher	and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus so that protestant	figures on social class give the impression of spread over all	social classes; but this is deceptive for the core of membership	is	concentrated in a single social and economic stratum.	5.245947626868565
16867. the congregation	perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the	neighborhood; moreover residential mobility is so high in metropolitan	areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum	in order to survive; they can lose higher- and lower-status members	from the church without collapsing but they need adequate recruits	for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration.	3.1077392065022593
16868. the	congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group; it is	secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship.	5.002690488845615
16869. if it were primarily	a believing fellowship it would recruit believers from all social	and economic ranks something which most congregations of the new protestantism	have not been able to do.	3.986340710607997
16870. they survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers.	7.190449566878833
16871. the vulnerability of protestant congregations to social differences	has often been attributed to the folksy spirit of protestant	religious life; in fact a contrast is often drawn in this regard	with the impersonal roman catholic parish.	3.212610369026049
16872. we have seen that	the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers; consequently the	vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress	on personal community in protestant congregations; actually there	is little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregations	as we shall see in another connection.	4.961975071162928
16873. the vulnerability of	protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of	the new religious style in middle-class life where the congregation is	a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform therefore	to the principle of economic integration.	3.324002333752603
16874. this fact is evident	in the recruitment of new members.	5.994254510250427
16875. the	rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the	missionary outreach of the major denominations.	4.449241787277296
16876. there is much talk	in theological circles about the church as mission and the church's	mission; theologians have been stressing the fact that	the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in	the world for the healing of the world.	5.3709803003096335
16877. a crucial question therefore	is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism.	3.4959374394254192
16878. if economic integration really shapes congregational life then	evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration.	6.285200608917529
16879. the task of a congregation would be defined according to economic integration	as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar	social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation.	3.3331485836324752
16880. fill a vacancy; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power	in a	mobile society congregational health depends on a constant process of	recruitment; this recruitment however must follow the pattern of	economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore	the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation	rather than proclamation- like elements will have to be assimilated.	4.698140747335367
16881. evangelism and congregational outreach have not been	carefully studied in the churches; one study in pittsburgh however	has illuminated the situation.	3.250895873909493
16882. in a sample of new members of pittsburgh	churches almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial contacts	with friendly members.	6.1189431865251676
16883. if we add to these contacts with friendly	members the contacts with an organization of the church	then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment	is through friendly contact.	3.8539339356175666
16884. on the surface this seems a sound	approach to christian mission: members of the congregation show by	their friendly attitudes that they care for new people; the new people	respond in kind by joining the church.	5.3255051593312785
16885. missionary outreach	by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what	is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods; the majority	of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic	position; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle	of informal relations.	3.056019701858924
16886. this means that the antennae of the congregation	are extended into the community picking up the wave lengths	of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation;	the mission of the church is actually a process of informal	co-optation; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people	who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation.	5.217372872702776
16887. churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long	as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people	who can fit the pattern of economic integration; once the pool of recruits	diminishes the congregation is helpless- friendly contacts no	longer keep it going.	3.308394693135786
16888. the transmutation of mission to co-optation	is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities	worship preaching and publicity in reaching new members.	4.500781118117243
16889. the	proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts	by the clergy and friendly contacts	by members.	3.431970680302389
16890. 1 per cent of the initial contacts with	new members.	8.999289676026072
16891. in general friendly contact with a member followed by	contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment	by the churches making it quite evident that the extension of economic	integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission	in the contemporary church; economic integration and co-optation are	the two methods by which protestants associate with and recruit from	the neighborhood.	3.1072590375573945
16892. the inner life of congregations will prosper so long	as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize	together; the outer life of congregations- the suitability	of the environment to their survival- will be propitious so long as	the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the	membership.	5.087735936906241
16893. economic integration ceases when the social and economic	statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of	the congregation.	3.7960587790480638
16894. in a rapidly changing society congregations will run	into difficulties repeatedly since such nice balances of economic integration	are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single	generation.	5.411918331926779
16895. the fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations	have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred	years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle	to maintain economic balance.	3.7000734776758906
16896. the expense of this type of organization	in religious life when one recalls the number of city churches which	deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned raises fundamental	questions about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile	society; nonetheless the prevalence of economic integration in congregations	illumines the nature of the protestant development.	5.276825233686755
16897. it was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had	split into two trends- expanding interdependence on an impersonal	basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings.	3.2150370411638596
16898. these trends	seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis.	6.027172341041511
16899. residential	associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions.	4.206559903055832
16900. the motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential	communities have polarized; the schism between central city and suburb	negro and white blue collar and white collar can be viewed as	symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis.	4.189170111665473
16901. it now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved	with the economy of middle-class culture for it serves to crystallize	the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings.	3.51059128051183
16902. the accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the	drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations.	4.931640737586788
16903. this	conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable	environment.	3.761311135318761
16904. more than creatures of metropolitan forces the	churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan	life crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of	peoples giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world	of heterogeneous peoples.	4.742268099015346
16905. since american life is committed	above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life the	countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have	fought a desperate rearguard action against the expanding interdependence	of the metropolis.	3.1908712259895498
16906. consumer communities have suffered at the hands	of the productive interests.	5.8557294993181745
16907. negroes puerto ricans and rural	newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities.	3.967205735087213
16908. soon they will	fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs and the churches	will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized	their history for a century.	5.05929216948372
16909. the identification of the basic unit	of religious organization- the parish or congregation- with a	residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis for it simply	means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the christian	fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation.	3.059273668575321
16910. mission	to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential	community because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan	interdependence with residential exclusion.	5.560092264438595
16911. this interpretation	of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could	lead to various projections for the churches.	3.754832727787823
16912. it could be argued	that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed	to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the	middle classes.	5.440132921250145
16913. it could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain	religious activity since worship presupposes some local stabilities.	3.8998262652767495
16914. whatever projection one makes the striking fact about congregational	and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the	social identity of middle-class people.	5.7845790864054445
16915. attention will be given	in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational	churches; this style is characteristically an expression of the	communal style of the middle classes.	3.70723142938601
16916. the keynotes of this style are	activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem.	4.7733683371620135
16917. these	values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman dictating	the methods of child rearing determining the pattern of community	participation setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of	middle-class illness and informing the congregational life of the major	denominations.	3.4026892598588376
16918. fellowship by likeness and mission by friendly	contact form the iron cage of denominational religion.	5.318324844237667
16919. its contents	are another matter for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued	by the congregation.	3.7223227058915485
16920. what goes on in the cage will occupy our attention	under the rubric of the organization church.	6.053585379383574
16921. an understanding	of the new role of residential association in an industrial society	serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of	conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity.	3.36999977408315
16922. the perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes	turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs	and charities should fill the same need.	4.937769860512282
16923. with capital largely squandered there seemed to them no other course	to pursue.	4.277471562758071
16924. the directors sold directly to concessionaires who	had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company.	4.977946012262688
16925. these concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt	with the indians through engages who might be habitants voyageurs	or even soldiers.	3.3476637950452517
16926. the concessionaires also had to pay a tax of	one-tenth on the goods they traded and all pelts were to be taken to	company stores and shipped to france in company ships.	4.968083001849151
16927. the company	disposed of the pelts but with what profit the records do not show.	3.35413356369227
16928. in accord with its penurious policy the company failed to furnish	presents to hold the loyalty of the principal indians.	5.928857486813164
16929. the lavish	use of presents had been effective in expanding the indian trade	of new france and louisiana in the previous century and the change	in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men.	3.257416654192512
16930. traders	from the english colonies were far more generous and indian loyalty	turned to them.	5.333138857328708
16931. protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded	and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose indian	insurrections that brought ruin to the company.	3.3367923866464344
16932. in 1721	the king sent three commissioners to louisiana with full powers to do	all that was necessary to protect the colony.	5.381323389306974
16933. they ordered the raising	of troops and obtained 75000 livres with which to build forts.	4.097633877764872
16934. they	adopted a program by which louisiana was divided into five districts.	5.753345907002701
16935. in each of these there was to be a strong military post and a trading	depot to supply the smaller trading houses.	4.69124889949019
16936. for southeastern	louisiana	mobile was the principal post and it was to furnish supplies	for trade to the north and east in the region threatened by british	traders.	6.617582467523564
16937. mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending	northward to the sources of the tennessee river.	4.451297267363611
16938. fort toulouse	on the alabama river had been erected in 1714 for trade with the alabamas	and choctaws but money was available for only one other new	post near the present nashville tennessee and this was soon abandoned.	4.785765605925853
16939. west of the mobile district was the lower mississippi	district of which new orleans was headquarters.	4.708266535367216
16940. dependent upon it	were posts on the lower mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers	of new spain.	5.359027204640037
16941. on the middle mississippi a principal	post was to be located near the mouth of the arkansas.	4.5219276550400735
16942. it was hoped	that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west	principally down the arkansas river.	5.22811866285287
16943. on the ohio or wabash was to	be built another post at the fork of two great rivers.	3.763812085894518
16944. other	posts would be established up the ohio and wabash to protect communication	with canada.	5.72666227315342
16945. on the upper mississippi the illinois post was	to be established near kaskaskia and dependent posts were to be built	on the missouri where there are mines in abundance.	3.68638623713595
16946. each of the five principal posts was to have a director responsible	to a director-general at new orleans.	6.8090817683408495
16947. an elaborate system of accounting	and reports was worked out and the trade was to be managed in the	most scientific way.	4.133811696231232
16948. concessionaires were to be under the supervision	of the directors.	7.234257976273037
16949. engages must be loyal to the concessionaires	and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended.	3.6247145275444033
16950. the habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose	of their pelts to the concessionaires.	5.661369031744312
16951. only two principal storehouses	were actually established- one at mobile the other at new	orleans.	4.094480707492453
16952. new orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the mississippi	and west of that river and on the ohio and wabash.	6.643039518295273
16953. mobile	was also supplied by new orleans with goods for the mobile district.	3.999646695056858
16954. the power that bienville exercised during his first administration	cannot be determined.	5.421001307394899
16955. regulations for the indian trade were	made by the conseil superieure de la louisiane and bienville	apparently did not have control of that body.	3.6057830227172687
16956. the conseil even	treated the serious matter of british aggression as its business and	on its own authority sent to disaffected savages merchandise suitable	for the peltry trade.	4.285273748823909
16957. it decided also that the purely secular	efforts of bienville were insufficient and sent missionaries to	win the savages from the heathen carolinians.	3.4672108798643686
16958. during the first	administration of bienville the peltry trade of the mobile district	was a lucrative source of revenue.	5.7451149703762425
16959. the alabamas brought in annually	15000 to 20000 deerskins and the choctaws and chickasaws brought	the total up to 50000 pelts.	2.97808387616078
16960. these deerskins were the raw material	for the manufacture of leather and were the only articles which the	tribes of this district had to exchange for european goods.	5.260946121660153
16961. during his first administration bienville succeeded in keeping carolina	traders out of the alabama country and the choctaw country.	4.3870824871523855
16962. the	director of the post at mobile kept an adequate amount of french	goods of a kind to which they were accustomed to supply the indian	needs.	5.985849999957172
16963. the alabama and tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which	goods could be moved quickly and cheaply.	3.115993761768256
16964. de la laude commander	of the alabama post had the friendship of the natives and was able	to make them look upon the british as poor competitors.	4.988800087330404
16965. diron d'artaguette	the most prominent trader in the district was energetic and	resourceful but his methods often aroused the ire of the french governors.	3.376963349199848
16966. he became after a time commander of a post on the alabama	river but his operations extended from mobile throughout the district	and he finally obtained a monopoly of the indian trade.	5.010149978120672
16967. the	chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the mobile district.	4.0546858686065015
16968. their territory lay to the north near the sources of the alabama	the tombigbee the tennessee and cumberland rivers and was	easily accessible to traders among the near-by cherokees.	5.197249884433383
16969. in 1720 some	chickasaws massacred the french traders among them and did not	make peace for four years.	3.5735072615577796
16970. venturesome traders however continued to	come to them from mobile and to obtain a considerable number of pelts	for the french markets.	5.415504098379313
16971. british traders from south carolina incited	the indians against the french and there developed french and	british factions in the tribe.	3.570229702583179
16972. the chickasaws finally were the occasion	for the most disastrous wars during the french control of louisiana.	4.767718167552581
16973. to hold them was an essential part of french policy for they	controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to mobile.	3.8519444826576237
16974. they threatened constantly to give the british a hold on this region	from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the french	settlements near the gulf.	5.076119907625149
16975. bienville realized that if the french	were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of british	goods french traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant	as the carolinians and at reasonable prices.	3.552650194346549
16976. his urgings brought	some results.	7.487674195966194
16977. the company of the indies promised to send over a supply	of indian trading goods and to price them more cheaply in terms	of deerskins.	3.466439609814012
16978. but it coupled with this a requirement that indians	must bring their pelts to mobile and thus save all costs of transportation	into and out of the indian country.	6.003537090256503
16979. the insistence of bienville	upon giving liberal prices to the indians in order to drive	back the carolina traders was probably a factor that led to his recall	in 1724.	3.5667074169238036
16980. for two years his friend and cousin boisbriant remained	as acting governor and could do little to stem the anglican advance.	5.355572254453386
16981. although he incited a few friendly indians to pillage the invaders	and even kill some of them the carolina advance continued.	4.053503897659081
16982. the company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from carolina	and when perier came over as governor in 1727 he was given special	instructions regarding the trade of the mobile district.	5.121173240511598
16983. but the	company of the indies holding to its program of economy made no arrangements	to furnish better goods at attractive prices.	3.5100441545844694
16984. to the directors	the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy.	6.975843290991986
16985. perier	attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among	the indians.	3.8128954340008
16986. these agents were to ascertain the difference between	english and french goods and the prices charged the indians.	5.40205827021927
16987. they	were to conciliate the unfriendly savages and wherever possible to	incite the natives to pillage the traders from carolina.	3.346570562098486
16988. they were	to promise fine presents to the loyal red men as well as an abundant	supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering.	5.37402373485118
16989. perier's intrigues gained some successes.	4.487010299911092
16990. the savages divided	into two factions; one was british and the other french.	5.700554233680886
16991. so hostile	did these factions become that among the choctaws civil war broke	out.	4.089147402507204
16992. perier's efforts however were on the whole ineffective	in winning back the tribes of the mobile district and he decided	to send troops into the troubled country.	5.476182686136597
16993. he asked the government	for two hundred soldiers who were to be specifically assigned to arrest	english traders and disloyal indians.	3.8657561375881513
16994. in spite of the company's	restrictions he planned to build new posts in the territory.	6.128520668025958
16995. he asked	also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the indians'	pelts.	3.857537065783019
16996. no help came from the crown and perier in desperation	gave a monopoly of the indian trade in the district to d'artaguette.	6.133914072586506
16997. d'artaguette went vigorously to work and gave credit to many	hunters.	4.016838060224668
16998. but they brought back few pelts to pay their debts and soon	french trade in the region was at an end.	6.060301388507503
16999. perier finally in one	last bid in 1730 cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent	above the cost in france.	3.7389822846002794
17000. the indians were not impressed and held	to the carolina traders who swarmed over the country almost to the	mississippi.	5.299090747501955
17001. with the loss of the mobile trade which ended	all profits from louisiana the natchez indians revolted.	4.114489913399347
17002. they destroyed	a trading house and pillaged the goods and harassed french shipping	on the mississippi.	5.247120124885239
17003. the war to subdue them taxed the resources	of the colony and piled up enormous debts.	3.2590278162806308
17004. in january 1731 the company	asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony.	6.19984179822139
17005. it stated that it had lost 20000000 livres in its operations and apparently	blamed its poor success largely on the indian trade.	3.556326614306875
17006. it offered	to surrender its right to exclusive trade but asked an indemnity.	5.753324476859198
17007. the king accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the	company at 1450000 livres.	3.2368452028323933
17008. thenceforth the commerce of louisiana	was free to all frenchmen.	5.979267492895885
17009. company rule in louisiana left the	colony without fortifications arms munitions or supplies.	3.459951650802856
17010. the difficulties	of trade had ruined many voyageurs and numbers of them	had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families.	4.691526274336579
17011. others	left the country and there was no one familiar with the indian trade.	5.162232883209963
17012. if this trade should be resumed the habitants who had come	to be farmers or artisans and soldiers discharged from the army must	be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois.	4.956351386609149
17013. this was a	slow and difficult course and french trade suffered from the many mistakes	of the new group of traders.	3.6991659932705345
17014. these men were without capital or	experience.	7.926979348050056
17015. perier and salmon the intendant wished either	to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown	furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts	with pelts.	3.3490526298067
17016. bienville who returned to succeed perier in 1732 objected	that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing	a trade in which they could see no hope of profits.	5.443238774922537
17017. he reported too	that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability	sufficient to justify entrusting them with the king's goods.	3.3257993010335287
17018. he did	find some to trust however and he employed the king's soldiers	to trade.	5.428048754826374
17019. with no company to interfere he kept close control over all	the traders.	4.173408775269862
17020. in order to compete with english traders bienville	radically changed the price schedule.	6.6695603905722605
17021. the king should expect	no profit and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in france	which would cover the expense of transportation and handling was all	he charged the traders.	3.560263168979174
17022. they would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned	a frolic in paris or hong kong at the treasury's expense.	5.679977650924279
17023. they would be particularly displeased with the state department if	it were the source of such reports.	4.841154087370978
17024. few things are more perilous for	the state department than a displeased congressman.	6.113917270261461
17025. the reason	for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why state spends	so much of its diplomatic energy on congress when the russians are	so available.	3.422531314031617
17026. first the state department is unique among government	agencies for its lack of public supporters.	7.0737052863236904
17027. the farmers may be aroused	if congress cuts into the agriculture department's budget.	3.232886906041447
17028. businessmen	will rise if congress attacks the commerce department.	5.959171488872447
17029. labor restrains undue brutality toward the labor department; the	chamber of commerce assaults upon the treasury.	3.7195827109208772
17030. a kaleidoscope of	pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly	toward the department of health education and welfare.	5.399740587233467
17031. the congressman's	patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the defense	department.	3.4192370686146827
17032. tampering with the post office may infuriate every	voter who can write.	6.134244645826163
17033. with all these agencies the congressman	must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly.	3.8907667129503998
17034. no such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon	the state department in anger.	5.676071109478928
17035. in many sections he may even	reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson.	3.9469679966490974
17036. after	all the money dispensed by state goes not to the farmer the laborer	or the businessman but to foreigners.	5.388523256793513
17037. not only do these foreigners	not vote for american congressmen; they are also probably	ungrateful for uncle's sam's bounty.	3.855133748431632
17038. and are not the state department	men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders	who have never met a payroll?	5.552104595873493
17039.  will not the righteous congressman	be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with america	and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes?	3.499969943839785
17040. 	the chances are excellent that he will.	6.176616151627016
17041. the result is	that the state department's perpetual position before congress is	the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever	the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife.	3.0525786737526546
17042. people in this	position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the	newspapers.	5.610543781866295
17043. state keeps the junketeering list a secret.	4.722440817265546
17044. the	department expects and receives no thanks from congress for its discretion.	5.455670061368199
17045. congress is a harsh master.	5.482575018745967
17046. state is expected to arrange the	touring cicero's foreign itinerary; its embassies are expected	to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way; embassy workers	are expected to entertain him according to his whim frequently with	their savings for the children's college tuition.	4.81490981228073
17047. but come	the next session of congress state can expect only that its summer	guest will bite its hand when it goes to the capitol asking money	for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for	its diplomats.	3.282349263571993
17048. the congressman who in paris may have stuffed his	wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of notre-dame will	systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance	for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the treasury.	4.28934971169964
17049. in the matter of money state's most unrelenting watchdog during	the eisenhower years was representative john j rooney of	brooklyn who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses.	3.276488152787016
17050. diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful	coexistence not with nikita khrushchev but with john rooney.	5.048663972505947
17051. in the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of	techniques they had tried to bring rooney around- friendly persuasion	groveling abasement pressure subtly exerted through other powerful	congressmen tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic	corps.	3.0534918218098883
17052. the trouble explained	loy henderson then deputy undersecretary for administration	is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing	it always turns out that rooney knows more about our budget than we	do.	4.601530415845194
17053. one year the department collected a file of case histories	to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's	entertainment bills out of personal income.	3.853935887180578
17054. news of the	project reached the press.	7.254929618384976
17055. next day reports went through the department	that rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt	to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances	and had sworn an oath that that year expense allowances would not	rise a dollar.	3.0787910956798865
17056. the department's constant	fight with the house for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic	bloody engagements with the senate.	4.966161514840132
17057. armed with constitutional	power to negate the executive's foreign policy the senate carries	a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the state department's	back or on the head of the secretary of state.	4.085008177580893
17058. with	its power to investigate the senate can paralyze the secretary by	keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees as it	did with dean acheson.	5.03458855733761
17059. john foster dulles escaped by keeping his	personal show on the road and because lyndon johnson who was then	operating the senate refused to let it become an inquisition.	3.694118569453255
17060. during	dulles's first two years in office while republicans ran the	senate the department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for	its	blood since 1945.	6.096092497560395
17061. an internal police operation managed by scott	mcleod a former fbi man installed as security officer	upon congressional insistence was part of the vengeance.	3.605746010586129
17062. so was	the attack upon charles e bohlen when eisenhower appointed him	ambassador to moscow.	5.576192598144156
17063. the principal mauler however was senator	joseph mccarthy.	3.8727812077407955
17064. where acheson had fought a gallant losing battle	for the department dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates.	5.334487774421496
17065. fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats	dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men	had their way.	3.1242924840029715
17066. in view of eisenhower's reluctance to concede	that anything was amiss in the terror it is doubtful that heroic intervention	by dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him	and the country's foreign policy.	4.686172810742903
17067. in any event the example of acheson's	trampling by the senate did not encourage dulles to provoke	it.	4.128109896578741
17068. he elected to get along.	7.658962874453516
17069. during this dark chapter	in state department history men who had offered foreign-policy ideas	later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to capitol	hill.	3.559650820061272
17070. their old errors of judgment were equated in the curious	logic of the time with present treasonous intent.	6.026618509062764
17071. their successors	absorbing the lesson made it a point to have few ideas.	4.45819392355944
17072. this	in turn brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the democrats	took control.	5.253595513056418
17073. in the new style the department was berated as intellectually	barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit	the russians.	3.8649156845161308
17074. for three or four years in the mid-1950's this	complaint was heard rumbling up from the senate floor whenever there	was a dull legislative afternoon.	6.019397952651318
17075. it became smart to say that the fault	was with dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by	anyone but himself.	4.159437545207163
17076. an equally tenable thesis is that the dearth	of new thought was created by the senate's own penchant for crucifying	anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation.	5.375701304058932
17077. getting along with foreigners	there are ninety-eight foreign	embassies and legations in washington.	3.6605792632349305
17078. they range from the soviet	embassy on sixteenth street a gray shuttered pile suggesting a	funeral-accessories	display house to what congressman rooney has called	that monstrosity on thirty-fourth street the modern cement-and-glass	chancery of the belgians.	4.542838549028426
17079. here is the world of the	chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter of caviar on stale crackers	and the warm martini of the poseur the spy the party crasher	and the patriot of the rented tails the double cross and the tired	lothario.	3.3041804338187153
17080. into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries	around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions	on how to handle uncle sam in an infinite variety of contingencies.	4.984986315881233
17081. here are hatched plans for getting a share of the american bounty	the secret of the anti-missile missile or an invitation to dinner.	4.129291796458891
17082. out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting	to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside washington.	5.708588646792639
17083. some like the british and the french maintain an elaborate	system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special	areas of the american scene.	3.844655350726802
17084. other embassies cable home the	new york times without changing a comma.	5.774368544325155
17085. each has its peculiar	style.	6.037207616504998
17086. the soviet embassy is popularly regarded as russian espionage	headquarters.	5.629631087125054
17087. when ambassador mikhail menshikov took it over	in 1957 from georgi zaroubin he made a determined effort to change	this idea.	3.508839309850179
17088. menshikov hit washington with a tv announcer's	grin and a hearty handclasp.	5.684563493557159
17089. to everyone's astonishment he seemed	no more like the run-of-the-mine russian ambassador than george babbitt	was like fyodor pavlovitch karamazov.	3.2544589311854497
17090. where his predecessors	had glowered menshikov smiled.	7.479074222706043
17091. where they had affected the	bleak social style of embalmers' assistants menshikov went abroad	gorgeous in white tie and tails.	3.6836058331850197
17092. overnight he became the most available	man in washington.	6.6056169819335615
17093. speeches by the soviet ambassador became the	vogue as he obliged rural maryland rotarians and national press club	alike.	3.459574332755708
17094. in senator joseph mccarthy's phrase it was the most	unheard-of thing ever heard of.	6.0901045144499575
17095. a newspaperman who met him at a reception	swore that he asked menshikov: what should we call you?	3.571786413290246
17096. 	and that menshikov replied: just call me mike.	5.566799547846426
17097. smilin' mike was the sobriquet washington gave him.	3.9618901567935434
17098. his english	was usable and he used it fearlessly.	6.378977622238562
17099. toasting in champagne one	night at the embassy he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and	gaily cried: up your bottom! for a few giddy months that	coincided with one of moscow's smiling moods he was the sensation	of washington.	3.291204076468979
17100. at the state department hard-bitten russian experts	complained that the capitol was out of its wits.	7.519945044199271
17101. newspaper punditry	was inspired to remind everyone that judas too had been able to	smile.	3.6668086794259884
17102. the menshikov interlude ended as larks with the russians	usually end.	4.8321599254012
17103. finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable	because of domestic politics moscow resumed scowling and smilin'	mike dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional	story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the middle west.	3.8692800798306086
17104. the most inscrutable embassies are the arabs' and the most	inscrutable of the arabs are the saudi arabians.	5.096508294129341
17105. when king saud	visited washington the overwhelming question consuming the press	was the size of his family.	4.0675102683964335
17106. rumor had it that his children numbered	in the hundreds.	6.163993389053421
17107. the state department was little help on this or	on much else about saudi arabia.	3.795457143742873
17108. a reporter who consulted a middle	east information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until	the state department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a	brochure published by the arabian-american oil company.	4.400808932528328
17109. this	is where i get my information from he confided.	4.625983352223362
17110. but bring it	right back.	8.064121196884221
17111. it's the only copy i've got.	4.573228363901731
17112. the size of	saud's family was still being debated when the king appeared for his	first meeting with eisenhower.	5.017387603124275
17113. when it ended a dusky sheik in desert	robes flowed into hagerty's office to report on the interview.	3.7702375293360046
17114. the massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about saudi-american	friendship to bore in on the central question.	4.800705526017766
17115. how many	children did the king have?	5.389875015624164
17116.    twenty-one replied the sheik.	7.472615735620575
17117. and how many of these were sons?	6.798739374667775
17118.    twenty-five	the sheik replied.	8.035901694095864
17119. do you mean to tell us a reporter	asked that the king has twenty-one children twenty-five of whom	are sons?	3.863942683941378
17120.    the sheik smiled and murmured: that is	precisely correct.	5.0779710082889
17121. the egyptians are noted for elusiveness	of language.	3.572713864045603
17122. when dag hammarskjold was negotiating the middle east	peace after israel's 1956 invasion of egypt he soon found himself	speaking the mysterious phrases of cairo a language as anarchic	as casey stengel's.	4.7298885416490295
17123. the reports of president nasser's pledges	which hammarskjold was relaying from cairo to washington became	increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats including the israeli	foreign minister mrs golda meir.	2.9154157291869898
17124. finally he reported that	nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for israeli	concessions.	6.92762708764519
17125. the deep water is used by many people but it is always clean for the	washing is done outside.	4.072717963574265
17126. i know now why our japanese friends were	surprised when they walked into our bathroom.	5.820122316881861
17127. of course most	toilets are eastern style- at floor level- but even when they are	raised to chair height they are actually outside toilets- inside.	3.4064372625747756
17128. a few newer homes have western flush toilets but even with running	water they are usually eastern style.	5.484187531595545
17129. the next day i visited	international christian college which has developed since the war	under the leadership of people who were interned and who know japan	well.	3.695920794131285
17130. they are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching	and learning.	6.559209439539327
17131. the library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical	stockroom.	3.811164334345392
17132. spiritual life is cultivated but students do not need	to be christian.	5.634150057208397
17133. they have an enviable record of being able to place	in employment 100% of their graduates.	4.240230139521333
17134. in the afternoon miss	hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young mrs	kodama to see the famous spring dances of the geisha dancers.	5.911796438253575
17135. mrs	hosaka is one of the japanese women one reads about- beautiful	artistically talented an artful manager of her big household-	and yet looking like a pampered gentle japanese	woman.	3.4023638929517
17136. she was a real experience! the dances were as beautiful	as anything i have ever seen- they rival the new york rockettes	for scenery and precision as well as imagination.	6.083837823308917
17137. because	don was leaving the next day i spent the evening with him at asia	center.	4.1772430378039225
17138. the following morning mr morikawa called for me and	we went to visit schools- kindergarten middle-school elementary	school and high school- mr yoshimoto's school.	4.561557030730972
17139. there	is much more freedom in the schools here than i expected- some think	too much.	4.227576113033338
17140. there is a great deal of thought being given to	the question of moral education in the schools.	6.905760848943906
17141. with the loss of the	emperor diety in japan the people are left in confusion with no god	or moral teachings that have strength.	3.862414429506027
17142. the older parents continued	to teach their children traditional principles but the younger people	who have lost all faith and convictions are now parents.	4.582743967632519
17143. there seems	to be no purpose in life that is sure- no certain guiding principles	to give stability.	4.056850560929821
17144. as a result money is spent quickly and freely	with no thought of its value.	6.384401889227717
17145. gambling is everywhere especially among	students.	4.71730069768622
17146. the government	has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education	for the schools- but the teachers often have no firm conviction	and are confused.	4.454142639498675
17147. i was told that it is quite likely that japanese	soldiers would not fight again- for why should they?	4.698109015524306
17148.  it will be	painful but interesting to see what kind of a god these people will	create or what strong convictions they will develop.	5.817672369815924
17149. in the evening	the former oregon state science teachers met for dinner at the	new tokyo restaurant where i had my first raw fish and found it good.	3.364817659184925
17150. they suggested several new foods and usually i found them good	except the sweets which i think i could learn to like.	5.420337406809336
17151. six of the	science teachers were present and we had great fun.	4.258024313552077
17152. after	a day at nikko mrs kodama put me on the train for kyoto.	5.738561088312077
17153. my instructions were that mr nishimo would meet me at the hotel	but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm	welcome.	3.714508664411991
17154. my hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by masu and the japan	travel bureau and were more elegant than i would have chosen	but it was fun for once to be elegant- i did explain to the students	however that this was not my usual style for their salaries are very	small and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well.	4.874066553660196
17155. they	understood and teased me a bit about it.	4.289972293747406
17156. i think i would have	been much disappointed in japan if i had not seen kyoto nara	and hiroshima.	6.250312469386272
17157. kyoto is the ancient capital of japan and still its	cultural center.	3.887516713113147
17158. it along with nara was untouched by the war-	and	is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar japan.	5.61307397063226
17159. here	i was accompanied by mrs okamoto her son	mr washizu	and mr nishima one of the science	teachers.	4.094150124806643
17160. i arrived at 7:00 am and by 9:00 am i had	finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned.	5.825188591208403
17161. we walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens.	4.469716619202126
17162. we visited the	okamoto home- where for the first time i saw the famous tea ceremony.	6.640927099358284
17163. at 6:00 pm we went to the kyoto spring dances at the place	where these beautiful dances originated.	3.8630774508553127
17164. they were even better than	those of tokyo- more spectacular and more imaginative.	5.9349907730859925
17165. after	a supper of unagi	i returned to my beautiful	room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day.	3.713422069889493
17166. we started at 9 am to visit the kyoto university where mr	washizu is attending.	6.184657948698431
17167. i was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities	accompanying the medical school.	4.631252683290374
17168. they apologized for the condition	including dirt and flies and i was a little at a loss to know what	to say.	5.946622940941715
17169. there seemed to be no excuse?	7.196224061995518
17170.  i don't have the answer	yet.	7.958168426453976
17171. we had tea at mr washizu's home where i learned	that he too comes from a very wealthy family.	4.024373993543326
17172. his grandfather is	a buddhist priest; and he being the eldest was supposed to be a priest	but he chose to do differently and one of his brothers is to become	the priest.	5.72028934300294
17173. this is a significant fact in japan for only a few	years ago he would have had no choice.	4.591711125884748
17174. in his big home live four families	and thirty people so it needs to be big.	6.137231646788936
17175. also there are housed	here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old-	paintings lacquer brocade etc.	3.4007533716721126
17176. he had displayed more of them	than usual so that i could enjoy them.	6.74502747790625
17177. about 100 of the most important	items he had already given to the museum.	5.064231412826662
17178. the house itself is 400	years old with all the craftsmanship of older less-hurried times.	5.672093977278241
17179. osaka and hiroshima	mr nishima went with me on the train	to nara.	3.9022327489529793
17180. we passed his house and school on the way.	6.887927807503138
17181. in nara i	stayed at the hotel where the prince and princess had stayed on their	honeymoon.	3.727560184462741
17182. a new red carpet had been laid for their coming but i	walked on it too.	5.670426507747837
17183. here mr yoneda met us after a three-hour train	trip from the town where he teaches.	4.039124463420904
17184. even though we had walked miles	in kyoto that day we started out again to see nara at night.	5.796474447301659
17185. in the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles	to osaka to put me on the train for hiroshima.	3.8108269815263327
17186. again the plan was	for me to go alone but they wouldn't let me.	6.442373474651118
17187. at osaka mr yoneda	had to leave us to get the train to his home but mr nishima	and i had an hour and a half before train time to see osaka at night.	3.8058553952848015
17188. it is the second largest city in japan with about four million people.	6.589333289783371
17189. one spot in osaka i shall always remember- the bridge where	we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the	still waters of the river.	3.4326288354029613
17190. in the midst of a great busy city people	take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light.	5.900011373553777
17191. my train arrived in hiroshima at the awful hour of 4:45	am.	4.1157036160172895
17192. i had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little	after which mr uno would arrive and pilot me around.	5.828089279345593
17193. but there	he was at the train with an oregon state pennant in his hand.	4.137402960110304
17194. i know now why the students insisted that i go to hiroshima even	when i told them i didn't want to.	5.703734922492547
17195. they knew that i was still grieving	over the tragic event and they felt that if i could see the	recovery	and the spirit of the people who hold no grudge but who also	regret pearl harbor i would be happier and would understand better	a new japan.	3.875787918886738
17196. there were no words to say this but there was no need.	8.180225431856773
17197. the teachers of mr uno's school gave me a small gift	to thank me for coming.	3.3660308402955925
17198. hiroshima is a better city than it was before-	in the minds of the people i met was a strong determination for peace	and understanding.	6.154193347021712
17199. i was grateful for their insight into my need	for this experience.	4.267781290470856
17200. a better world may yet come out of hiroshima.	6.577707615947783
17201. on arriving in tokyo later we were met by masu who took	us immediately to her university the japanese women's university.	3.6098208087917154
17202. this day was open house for parents day and the girls were	busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables.	5.12927503550108
17203. everything was in	an exciting turmoil- full of anticipation and fun.	4.106543799961524
17204. it was	thrilling to see the effect of an american-trained teacher on japanese	students in a class in home planning.	6.355134378881478
17205. our masu is one of the very	few architects in japan who is trying to plan homes around family	functions and women's needs.	3.908873338905894
17206. i am told the time will soon come when	women will find it necessary to do most of their own work and even now	it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants.	6.654834255891612
17207. many	of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in american	homes but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using japanese	artfulness in our own western architecture at the same time that the	japanese are adopting western utility patterns.	3.444392533901902
17208. at this women's	university we find a monument to a courageous family who believed	that japanese women also should be educated.	5.844722039731492
17209. even today there are	some doubts about the value of education for japanese women but this	university continues to grow and to send its students out into the	community.	3.861185283902708
17210. active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus	where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they	can have their social gatherings and professional meetings.	5.193129535412898
17211. as far	as i am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the	creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found	by educated women unafraid to break traditions.	3.9605246315645513
17212. masu is also	teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for japanese widows in tokyo.	5.669139521132372
17213. here the women learn to keep house as maids; they become skilled	in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests.	3.7438487248449426
17214. they learn how	to take care of children and sick members of the family.	7.197887298454525
17215. they have model	kitchens a sick room with a model patient in bed and a nursery with	a life-like doll.	3.872483738158323
17216. although the training is only for one month it	is intensive and thorough.	7.105680700022518
17217. graduates of this maid's school are much	in demand and can always find work immediately.	3.5404889915813924
17218. occasionally they return	for additional training.	7.919945636255481
17219. masu's home economics training comes	into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for	the storage of cleaning materials.	3.118403416476794
17220. masu also uses the training she got	in an american home where she learned to polish furniture clean corners	and work effectively in keeping a shiny house.	4.825650768146232
17221. her education in	the united states not just in a classroom but also in an american	house with an american housekeeper stands her in good stead.	3.6402493185426974
17222. of tokyo	after a fine luncheon in the cafeteria the kitchen	of which masu had planned mr washizu and i left to meet representatives	of the usis for a visit to the university of tokyo.	5.4765714848715
17223. here again it was vacation time and there were many things i could	not see but i was able to visit with a professor who is famous	in japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant.	3.873213610455242
17224. the achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only	by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following	consultation between attorney general rogers and the heads	of certain national chain stores should of course be applauded.	4.377420997821974
17225. but	for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of	a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts	contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case.	3.708331528815715
17226. the suppositions	in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing	a connection between general company practice and local practice	in the south and by establishing such direct connection between the	practice and the economic well-being of stores located in new york	and general company policy.	4.428342908696334
17227. then the boycott would not be secondary	but a primary one.	4.993717965311824
17228. it would be directed against the actual location of	the unjust policy which for love's sake and for the sake of justice	must be removed and indivisible from this to the economic injury	of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy.	5.542461757284353
17229. perhaps	this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire	national chain in order by threatening potential injury to its entire	economy to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores	in the matter of segregation.	3.3172915291387937
17230. such a general boycott might still be a	blunt or indiscriminating instrument and therefore of questionable	justification.	5.6250160567412495
17231. action located where the evil is concentrated will prove	most decisive and is most clearly legitimate.	3.6723599186767317
17232. moreover prudence alone	would indicate that unless the local customs are already ready to	fall when pushed the results of direct economic action everywhere upon	national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage	to local and state stores which conform to these customs leading to	greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company or even	to its going out of business in certain sections	of the country	meetings in the pre-civil war south largely went out of business	in that part of the country over the slavery issue never to recover	.	4.618172659987534
17233. in any case anyone who	fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary	applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified	that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years	ago or was skillfully organized by white citizens' councils	in the entire state of mississippi against every local philco dealer	in that state in protest against a philco-sponsored program over a	national tv network on which was presented a drama showing it seemed	a high yellow gal smooching with a white man.	3.048810005389221
17234. it is true	of course that the end or objective of this action was different.	6.183911889534063
17235. but	since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals	and concerning justice and injustice and since in a situation where	direct action and economic pressure are called for the justice of the	matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not	effectively present there has to be a morality of means applied in	every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures	or other forms of force.	3.4360428162085164
17236. the need that we not give unqualified	approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed	against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the	fact that white citizens' councils seem resolved to maintain segregation	mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical	violence.	4.787009968406001
17237. an unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically	opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow	humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously	brutal means.	3.6917381635240365
17238. the end or aim of the action of course is also	important especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community	customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person	from stepping forward to claim his legal rights eg against	negroes who register to vote in fayette county tennessee at the	present moment.	5.389501767942336
17239. here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance	to those being despoiled and to legal remedies.	3.759601608439953
17240. this however	is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and	economic conflict can be war of all	against all no less than if other means are used.	5.373374590357137
17241. it is also sufficient	to show the christian and any other champion of justice that he needs	to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct	is just ie that if economic pressure has to be resorted	to this be applied directly against those persons directly in the	way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices while	if injury fall upon others it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily	and not by deliberate intent and direct	action against them.	3.0871510223794227
17242. it is clear that non-violent resistance is	a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in christian	morality like any other form of resistance.	5.283587721288246
17243. the language used	itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle	for victory.	3.579725959142708
17244. one of the sit-in	leaders has said: nobody from the top of heaven to the bottom	of hell can stop the march to freedom.	5.589769959915871
17245. everybody in the world today	might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom	is going to march over them.	4.005295511906436
17246. the present writer certainly agrees	with that statement and would also affirm this- in the order of justice.	5.489483218145322
17247. however it is also a christian insight to know that unless charity	interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches	forward.	5.023369023602999
17248. and when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice	and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental	good will.	5.5856381761067375
17249. it also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained	above and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent	means.	4.869713684142508
17250. r b gregg has written that non-violence and good will of	the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical	jiu-jitsu to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance.	4.819987643462515
17251. he	suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent	resistance of most victims would render him; and again that	the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object	of war- namely to demoralize the opponent to break his will	to destroy his confidence enthusiasm and hope.	2.8886099757222485
17252. in another respect	it is dissimilar for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent	only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is	based on sounder values.	4.719712278694097
17253. a trial of strength however is made	quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent	resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder	values than those of his opponent; and in warfare with any means	men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause.	3.5112224407631913
17254. this makes necessary	a morality of means and principles governing the conduct of	resistance whenever this is thought to be justified.	5.497407907917333
17255. the question	then is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent	means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes	and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing	him.	3.8234537669799535
17256. here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some	causes as more important than their lives; and to them it will seem	insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently.	5.936302750311426
17257. a technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into	the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem	the more unlimited aggression.	3.6072053939157667
17258. among christian groups the	mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that	the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the	christian use of all forms of pressure.	5.831293534095732
17259. since the will and word of god	are for them concentrated in christlike love it seems clear to them	that non-violent resistance is quite another thing.	3.6973905048359086
17260. the primary	objective of non-violence writes the outstanding mennonite ethicist	is not peace or obedience to the divine will but rather certain	desired social changes for personal or class or national advantage.	4.282714887271321
17261. without agreeing with every phrase in this statement we must	certainly assert the great difference between christian love and any	form of resistance and then go on beyond the mennonite position and	affirm that christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine	the moral principles limiting resistance.	3.1331617860459358
17262. these principles we	have now set forth.	6.897347192205558
17263. economy in the use of power needs not only to	be asserted but clearly specified; and when this is done it will	be found that the principles governing christian resistance cut across	the distinction between violent and non-violent means and apply to	both alike justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action.	3.2637587633874707
17264. economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a	barely	intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed.	5.5756281951252324
17265. that would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly	in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals.	3.7186300227596187
17266. there	must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use	of means of resistance violent or non-violent.	5.65810453196054
17267. the justification	in christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays	down its limitation- in the distinction between the persons against	whom pressure is primarily directed those upon whom it may be permitted	also to fall and those who may never be directly repressed for the	sake even of achieving some great good.	3.2729014562381065
17268. in these terms the economic	withdrawal of the negroes of nashville tennessee from trading	in the center city for example was clearly justified since these	distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be	singled out.	4.90693624723784
17269. we may now take up for consideration a hard case	which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure	or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above.	3.4240026271035022
17270. there may be instances in which if economic pressure is to be undertaken	at all this would have to be applied without discrimination	against a whole people.	6.870024351034036
17271. an excellent article was published recently in	the journal of the church peace union by a south african journalist	on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in south africa	amounting to virtual slavery and the economic complicity of both	the government and the people of the united states in these conditions.	3.7389639252509004
17272. h billions of american dollars not only from capital investors	but also from the pockets of u s taxpayers this author	states are being poured into south africa to support a system	dedicated to the oppression the persecution and the almost diabolical	exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens	not to be white.	4.600889616148173
17273. both the conditions and the complicity are documented	in considerable detail.	4.2852986955898125
17274. this leads to the conclusion that the	fact is inescapable that america does have a say in whether or not	apartheid shall continue.	5.534111679970464
17275. our leadership in a wide economic	boycott of south africa would be not only in accord it seems with	the moral conscience of america not to be denied because we also as	a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our	own country but also in accord with our law us code title	19 section 1307 which forbids the importation of goods made by forced	or convict labor.	3.2681613904188564
17276. not only should this provision be enforced but	other economic and political actions might be taken which this author	believes must surely be supported by every american who values the	freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated	by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly	contribute to the enslavement of another nation.	4.9221654375088395
17277. northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights	and of integration.	3.9734347686691627
17278. they have also led the nation in the direction	of a welfare state.	7.346704734276281
17279. and both in their objectives of non-discrimination	and of social progress they have had ranged against them the southerners	who are called bourbons.	3.6889255347121055
17280. the name presumably derives from the	french royal house which never learned and never forgot; since bourbon	whiskey though of kentucky origin is at least as much favored	by liberals in the north as by conservatives in the south.	4.74548734705313
17281. the	nature of the opposition between liberals and bourbons is too little	understood in the north.	3.711323495467147
17282. the race problem has tended to obscure other	less emotional issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive.	5.035924074695325
17283. it is these other differences between north and south- other	that is than those which concern discrimination or social welfare-	which i chiefly discuss herein.	3.1841120727291825
17284. i write about northern liberals	from considerable personal experience.	6.377357460411967
17285. a southerner married to	a new englander i have lived for many years in a connecticut commuting	town with a high percentage of artists writers publicity men	and business executives of egghead tastes.	3.435310574199167
17286. most of them are democrats	and nearly all consider themselves and are viewed as liberals.	6.946374614249422
17287. this	is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of	liberalism because it is clear that these democrats who are left-of-center	are at opposite poles from the liberal jefferson who held that	the best government was the least government.	3.612186136939616
17288. yet paradoxically my	liberal	friends continue to view jefferson as one of their patron saints.	7.11154646260822
17289. when i question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and	democracy i find that they fall into two categories: the simpler	ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without	analysis; and the intelligent cynical ones who scornfully reply that	these things don't count any more in the world of to-day.	3.5032985135910995
17290. i am naive	they say to make use of such words.	7.901028645692375
17291. i take this to mean	that the intelligent- and therefore necessarily cynical?	3.9503350244453657
17292. - liberal	considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will	assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual	and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield	before it.	5.525072965165742
17293. this seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian	bureaucracy which under a president of the same stamp would try	to coerce an uncooperative congress or supreme court.	3.7546267623679768
17294. as for states'	rights they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends	except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist	now only as anachronisms.	5.217893973736478
17295. the american liberal may in the world	of to-day have a strong case; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed	in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one.	3.8900796879793083
17296. why in the first place	call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors	an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over	everybody?	6.069218330160344
17297.  if he attaches little importance to personal liberty	why not make this known to the world?	4.097040122340186
17298.  and if he is so scornful of	the rights of states why not advocate a different sort of constitution	that he could more sincerely support?	5.911516574890379
17299.    i am concerned here	however with the northern liberal's attitude toward the south.	4.265102324967172
17300. it	appears to be one of intense dislike which he makes little effort	to conceal even in the presence of southern friends.	6.049500531321839
17301. his assumption	seems to be that any such friends being tolerable humans must be more	liberal than most southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy	with his views.	3.354849641719034
17302. time's editor thomas griffith in his book	the waist-high culture wrote: h most of what was	different about it i found myself unsympathetic to	h.	5.149477194678922
17303. this for the liberals i know would be an understatement.	4.56996811629273
17304. theirs is no mere lack of sympathy but something closer to the passionate	hatred that was directed against fascism.	5.519614364910877
17305. i do not think	that my experience would be typical for southerners living in the	north.	3.981781320360555
17306. in business circles usually conservative this sort of atmosphere	would hardly be found.	6.041951101239885
17307. but in our case- and neither my wife nor	i have extreme views on integration nor are we given to emotional	outbursts- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and	come close to wrecking several more.	3.3139351150635337
17308. in fact it has caused us to give	serious thought to moving our residence south because it is not easy	for the most objective southerner to sit calmly by when his host	is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with southerners	who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards	down.	5.297202451257813
17309. accounts have been published of northern liberals in	the south up against segregationist prejudice especially in state-supported	universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority	view.	3.202276540656283
17310. but these accounts do not show that northerners have been subjected	to embarrassment or provocation by yankee-hatred displayed in	social gatherings.	5.296407378205671
17311. from my wife's experience and other sources this	seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles.	3.828041397221164
17312. the strong feeling	is certainly there; but there is a leavening of liberalism among	college graduates throughout the south especially among those who	studied in the north.	4.946184127130066
17313. and social relations arising out of business	ties impose courtesy if not sympathy toward resident and visiting northerners.	3.432940869708623
17314. also among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the	prevalent southern attitude on most social problems.	5.851104902294228
17315. there	are of course many souths; but for this discussion the most important	division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who	haven't.	3.9275137755524727
17316. my definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed	rebel is one who is glad that the north won the war.	6.258070512513345
17317. nobody	knows how many southerners there are in this category.	4.6168419372017935
17318. i suspect	that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the north likes to	believe.	6.160034327438711
17319. i never heard of a poll being taken on the question.	4.428946197974924
17320. no doubt	such a thing would be considered unpatriotic.	7.416960995777286
17321. prior to 1954 i imagine	that a majority of southerners would have voted against the confederacy.	3.9670326467604533
17322. since the supreme court's decision of that year this is	more doubtful; and if a poll had been taken immediately following	the dispatch of troops to little rock i believe the majority would	have been for the old south.	5.5426637486952295
17323. belief in the traditional way of	life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones.	4.973561071458516
17324. probably	a larger percentage of virginians and south carolinians remain	unreconstructed than elsewhere with georgia north carolina and	alabama following along after them.	4.676921276527998
17325. old attitudes are held more tenaciously	in the tidewater than the piedmont; so that a line running	down the length of the south marking the upper limits of tidewater	would roughly divide the old south from the new but with of course	important minority enclaves.	3.480120998500898
17326. the long-settled areas of states	like virginia and south carolina developed the ante-bellum culture	to its richest flowering and there the memory is more precious and	the consciousness of loss the greater.	4.378442678165925
17327. also we should not even to-day	discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering	on charleston had closer ties with england and the west indies	than with the north even after independence.	3.816074876251023
17328. the social and psychological	consequences of this continue to affect the area.	5.870944998847486
17329. in certain	respects defeat increased the persistent anglophilia of the old south.	4.336587881299557
17330. poor where they had once been rich humbled where they had been	arrogant having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the	nation the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from	the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country.	5.211723399215968
17331. and	no doubt many people in states like the carolinas and georgia which	were among the most tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century bitterly	regretted the revolt against the crown.	3.384077441450227
17332. among bourbons	the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed	than other factors.	6.405278596562045
17333. all southerners agree that slavery had to	go; but many historians maintain that except for northern meddling	it would have ended in states like virginia years before it did.	3.3306318066703207
17334. southern	resentment has been over the method of its ending the invasion	and reconstruction; their fears now are of miscegenation and negro	political control in many counties.	4.953156548556693
17335. but apart from racial problems	the old unreconstructed south- to use the moderate words favored by	mr thomas griffith- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what	is different about the civilization of the north.	3.2082316276556186
17336. and this in effect	means most of modern america.	7.480163790043658
17337. it is hard to see how the	situation could be otherwise.	5.139112117283126
17338. and therein i feel many northerners	delude themselves about the south.	5.977922130951302
17339. for one thing this is not a subject	often discussed or analyzed.	5.209608117295727
17340. there seems to be almost a conspiracy	of silence veiling it.	7.292734965780781
17341. i suppose the reason is a kind of wishful	thinking: don't talk about the final stages of reconstruction and	they will take care of themselves.	4.040090651344333
17342. or else the north really believes	that all southerners except a few quaint old characters have come	around to realizing the errors of their past and are now at heart sharers	of the american dream like everybody else.	5.074229583321682
17343. if the circumstances	are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be	true.	4.4886027481864
17344. the situation of the south since 1865 has been unique in the western	world.	6.643285073163195
17345. regardless of rights and wrongs a population and an area	appropriate to a pre-world-war-1 great power have been following	conquest	ruled against their will by a neighboring people and have had	imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike.	3.29032728327201
17346. and the	great majority of these people are of anglo-saxon or celtic descent.	6.13128963925171
17347. this is the only case in modern history of a people of britannic	origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign	domination.	3.9685517867745044
17348. the fact is due mainly to international wars both hot	and cold.	5.665093439678942
17349. in every war of the united states since the civil war	the south was more belligerent than the rest of the country.	4.804147944035572
17350. so instead	of being tests of the south's loyalty the spanish war the	two world wars and the korean war all served to overcome old grievances	and cement reunion.	4.988670685186233
17351. and there is no section of the nation more	ardent than the south in the cold war against communism.	5.528528251424825
17352. had the	situation been reversed had for instance england been the enemy in	1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to new england there is	little doubt that large numbers of southerners would have happily put	on their old confederate uniforms to fight as allies of britain.	4.722181579233643
17353. it	is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as southerners	should have been as docile as they have.	3.6480400458851427
17354. the north should thank its	stars that such has been the case; but at the same time it should not	draw false inferences therefrom.	5.730015470222045
17355. the two main charges levelled	against the bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social	reactionaries.	3.881977520237071
17356. there is much truth in both these charges and not	many bourbons deny them.	6.248782582272756
17357. whatever their faults they are not hypocrites.	5.519127485746325
17358. most of them sincerely believe that the anglo-saxon is the best	race in the world and that it should remain pure.	8.31508287436488
17359. many northeners	believe this too but few of them will say so publicly.	4.457463238702516
17360. the bourbon	economic philosophy moreover is not very different from that of northern	conservatives.	5.407031410762597
17361. but those among the bourbons who remain unreconstructed	go much further than this.	3.9828372752610997
17362. they believe that if the south	had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that	of modern america.	5.983449782356791
17363. as it is they consider that the north is now	reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism that in spite of its high	standard of living the american way has been proved inferior	to the english and scandinavian ways although they disapprove of the	socialistic features of the latter.	3.6963005470284327
17364. the south's antipathy	to northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners harsh	accents lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy	and the use of leisure.	4.8701503241398205
17365. their own easier slower tempo is especially	dear to southerners; and i have heard many say that they are content	to earn a half or a third as much as they could up north because	they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town.	3.576143006418192
17366. in the past the duties of the state as sir henry maine noted	long ago were only two in number: internal order and external security.	6.110150373263157
17367. by prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men	the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order	within its territorial borders.	3.3000780055005263
17368. outside those limits it asserted as	against other states a position of sovereign equality and as against	the inferior peoples of the non-western world a position of	dominance.	5.10547037388512
17369. it became the sole subject of international law		a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what western	nations could do in the world arena.	4.28909923217658
17370. reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and	nineteenth centuries.	6.618433614294976
17371. speaking generally it furthered- and still	tends to further- the interests of the western powers.	3.9599032591547068
17372. the enormous	changes in world politics have however thrown it into confusion so	much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in	need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions	beyond the two basic tasks mentioned	above no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state	responsibility either internally or externally.	4.891912733337628
17373. this was particularly	true in the world arena which was an anarchical battleground characterized	by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires.	3.84777732521699
17374. that any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have	astonished a nineteenth-century statesman.	5.444283781373598
17375. his duty was to his sovereign	and to his nation and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial	boundaries was not to be contemplated.	3.8778019888854627
17376. thus to cite but one	example the pax britannica of the nineteenth century whether with	the british navy ruling the seas or with the city of london ruling	world finance was strictly national in motivation however much other	nations may have incidentally benefited.	4.996172614692335
17377. at the same time all suggestions that some sort of societal	responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial	state was strongly resisted.	4.22029786828386
17378. social darwinism was able to stave	off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century.	5.978950659447244
17379. however in recent decades for what doubtless are multiple	reasons an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has	occurred in both facets of national activity.	3.464396707083179
17380. a concept of responsibility	is in process of articulation and establishment.	5.8060341396737805
17381. already firmly	implanted internally it is a growing factor in external matters.	4.744696903223991
17382. a little more than twenty years ago the american people turned	an important corner.	7.488865915005864
17383. in what has aptly been called a constitutional	revolution the basic nature of government was transformed from	one essentially negative in nature to	one with affirmative duties to perform.	3.3378439340500927
17384. the positive state came	into existence.	6.4025490497488295
17385. for lawyers reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences	there has been a special fascination since then in the role	played by the supreme court in that transformation- the manner in	which its decisions altered in the switch in time that saved nine	president roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious court-packing	plan the imprimatur of judicial approval that was	finally placed upon social legislation.	3.0856895119210583
17386. of greater importance however	is the content of those programs which have had and are having enormous	consequences for the american people.	5.838231258118497
17387. labor relations have been	transformed income security has become a standardized feature of political	platforms and all the many facets of the american version of	the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom.	3.91104052171419
17388. a national	consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts	are desirable as well as necessary.	5.612325918859975
17389. ratified in the republican party	victory in 1952 the positive state is now evidenced by political	campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much social	legislation there should be.	3.393496488175681
17390. the general acceptance of the idea	of governmental responsibility for the economic	well-being of the american people is surely one of the two most significant	watersheds in american constitutional history.	6.189251525114625
17391. the other of	course was the civil war the conflict which a century ago insured	national unity over fragmentation.	3.820496581643808
17392. a third one of at least equal and	perhaps even greater importance is now being traversed: american	immersion and involvement in world affairs.	5.28911615129733
17393. internal national	responsibility now a truism need not be documented.	4.297650944854278
17394. nevertheless	it may be helpful to cite one example- that of employment- for as	will be shown below it cuts across both facets of the new concept.	5.2764187366993385
17395. thirty	years ago while the nation was wallowing in economic depression	the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow	natural forces to operate and cure the distress.	3.3822803052078867
17396. that guiding	principle of the hoover administration fell to the siege guns of the	new deal; less than a score of years later congress enacted the	employment act of 1946 by which the national government assumed the	responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment.	5.03333488306882
17397. hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through	planning- the economic side of the constitutional revolution.	3.90467355570693
17398. in	1961 the first important legislative victory of the kennedy administration	came when the principle of national responsibility for local	economic distress won out over a state's-responsibility	proposal- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief	by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted	with manpower surplus.	4.941996217472675
17399. the american people have indeed come	a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961.	3.807235481178492
17400. internal	national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the	industrial revolution.	6.075758395869405
17401. reduced to its simplest terms it is an assumption	of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals	to cope with the rigors of the era.	3.6793428702155158
17402. national responsibility for	individual welfare is a concept not limited to the united states or	even to the western nations.	6.504505019235902
17403. a measure of its widespread acceptance	may be derived from a statement of the international congress of jurists	in 1959.	4.113483489353386
17404. meeting in new delhi under the auspices of the international	commission of jurists a body of lawyers from the free world	the congress redefined and expanded the traditional rule of law	to include affirmative governmental duties.	4.8790998488301875
17405. it is noteworthy that	the majority of the delegates to the congress were from the less developed	former colonial nations.	4.0146969309145035
17406. the rule of law historically a principle	according everyone his day in court before an impartial tribunal	was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of	government to promote individual welfare.	4.651376511975993
17407. recognizing that the rule	of law is a dynamic concept h which should be employed not only	to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free	society the congress asserted that it also included the responsibility	to establish social economic educational and cultural conditions	under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized.	3.222714640164158
17408. the idea of national responsibility thus has become a common	feature of the nations of the non-soviet world.	6.4937432227144365
17409. for better or for worse	we all now live in welfare states the organizing principle of which	is collective responsibility for individual well-being.	3.6853848925379227
17410. whether	a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility	operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more	difficult to establish.	5.068231808551735
17411. the hypothesis ventured here is that it does	and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition.	3.540594548954762
17412. the content	is not the same however: rather than individual security it	is the security and continuing existence of an ideological group-	those in the free world- that is basic.	4.622105715881927
17413. external national	responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of	the western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability	of other friendly nations.	3.217888419600229
17414. if internal responsibility suggests acceptance	of the socialist ideal of equality then external responsibility	implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism.	5.161431282000894
17415. reference to two other concepts- nationalism and sovereignty-	may help to reveal the contours of the new principle.	3.883124897471269
17416. in its beginnings	the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself- internally	against feudal groups and externally against the power and influence	of such other claimants for loyalty as the church.	4.979187579893193
17417. the breakup of	the holy roman empire and the downfall of feudalism led not more	than two centuries ago to the surge of nationalism.	3.213968880122953
17418. of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence	of the united states as an independent entity it is perhaps natural	for americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest	the concept of	nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies	the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure.	5.460617588605283
17419. but	it is more than that.	6.271798007364417
17420. for it includes the emotional ties that bind	men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large	group of people together as a unit.	5.199492910941442
17421. today as new nations rise from	the former colonial empires nationalism is one of the hurricane forces	loose in the world.	4.058835883427613
17422. almost febrile in intensity the principle has	become worldwide in application- unfortunately at the very time that	nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm.	5.21765576323059
17423. historically however	the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the	western civilizational group.	4.629304060660198
17424. by subduing disparate lesser groups	the nation has to some degree at least broadened the capacity for individual	liberty.	5.920131299245924
17425. within their confines moreover technological and	industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace thus increasing	the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied.	3.2775748416910853
17426. while the	pattern is uneven some having gained more than others nationalism	has in fact served the western peoples well.	5.4453496606707334
17427. helped the peoples of the remainder of the world and whether	today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial	it is one of the ironic quirks	of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the	territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that	the nation-state attained its highest number.	3.421587903210742
17428. but	it is more than irony: one of the main reasons why nationalism is	no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the	planet.	6.1829963770641365
17429. in other words nationalism worked well enough when it had	limited application both as to geography and as to population; it	becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis.	3.36610398569744
17430. complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal	principle of sovereignty.	5.989392029408129
17431. the former receives its legitimacy from the	latter.	3.8871950008856997
17432. operating side by side together they helped shore up the nation-state.	6.5832878445361995
17433. while sovereignty has roots in antiquity in its present	usage it is essentially modern.	3.8739413273272065
17434. jean bodin writing in the sixteenth	century may have been the seminal thinker but it was the vastly influential	john austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now	understood.	6.061302959566759
17435. austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty	still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking.	3.741668946031527
17436. to	him law is the command of the sovereign who	personifies the power of the nation while sovereignty is the power to	make law- ie to prevail over internal groups and to be free	from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations.	5.430799888626977
17437. these fundamental	ideas- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual	aspects- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate	political power.	3.614910204871718
17438. the nation-state then exemplifies the principle	of nationalism and exercises sovereignty: supreme power over	domestic affairs and independence from outside control.	4.354626768263743
17439. in fact however	both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined.	4.319965414350225
17440. high-level	abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision.	5.91104492761453
17441. that is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic	societies in which popular sovereignty is said to exist	and in federal nations in which the jobs of government are split.	4.054446788514951
17442. nevertheless	nationalism and sovereignty are reputed in the accepted	wisdom to describe the modern world.	5.54054652942337
17443. is there a different reality behind	the facade?	5.332204119222106
17444.  does the surface hide a quite different picture?	7.424384575610066
17445. 	the short answer to those questions is yes.	4.097475925154126
17446. both concepts	are undergoing alteration; to some degree they are being supplanted	by a concept of national responsibility.	6.133969024613201
17447. as evidence to support	that view consider the following illustrative instances.	4.192525693189824
17448. can thermonuclear war be set off by accident?	7.242630139717669
17449.  what steps have been	taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the	destruction of continents?	3.6025069005299186
17450.  are we as safe as we should be from such	a disaster?	7.261243567892158
17451.  is anything being done to increase our margin of safety?	4.577656512604009
17452. 	will the danger increase or decrease?	6.1517311794317955
17453.    i have just asked	these questions in the pentagon in the white house in offices of	key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl	for months underwater with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain	polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as sherwood	forest.	3.4389234466785523
17454. i asked the same questions inside the launch-control	rooms of an atlas missile base in wyoming where officers who wear	sidearms are manning the commit buttons that could start a war-	accidentally or by design- and in the command centers where other	pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons.	4.827212376027165
17455. to	the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits submarine compartments	and the antiseptic windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of	tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars the questions seem farfetched.	3.379183301900336
17456. there is unceasing pressure but its sources are immediate.	6.823452472563424
17457. readiness exercises are almost continuous.	4.741443162537189
17458. each could be the real	thing.	8.525575885365981
17459. in the command centers there are special clocks ready	to tick off the minutes elapsed since e hour.	3.5134783019125875
17460. e	stands for execution- the moment a go order would unleash	an american nuclear strike.	5.516409257251272
17461. there is little time for the men in the	command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks.	4.455895009262935
17462. they are preoccupied riding herd on control panels switches flashing	colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business	machines.	5.037162437446246
17463. they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical	details.	4.7042707214146136
17464. accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people	who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so	they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks.	5.007987332139285
17465. among	the policy makers generals physicists psychologists and others	charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their	hardware the answers to my questions varied partly according to	a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call scenarios.	3.3036563716625853
17466. as an air force psychiatrist put it: you can't have	dry runs on this one.	5.823763266971576
17467. the experts are thus forced to hypothesize	sequences of events that have never occurred probably never will-	but possibly might.	3.2926426165051823
17468. only one rule prevailed in my conversations with	these men: the more highly placed they are- that is the more they	know- the more concerned they have become.	5.406350715142241
17469. already accidental	war is a silent guest at the discussions within the kennedy administration	about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions	of national security.	3.3383771494902144
17470. only recently new holes were	discovered in our safety measures and a search is now on for more.	5.6174451861940415
17471. work	is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed	on all nuclear weapons.	3.727334138670717
17472. meanwhile the experts speak of	wars triggered by false pre-emption escalation unauthorized	behavior and other terms that will be discussed in this report.	5.498814494536007
17473. they inhabit a secret world centered on go codes and gold	phones.	3.921627792029864
17474. their conversations were almost invariably accompanied	by the same gestures- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward	each other in arclike semicircular motions.	4.965934536235445
17475. one arm represented our bombers	and missiles the other arm theirs.	4.0601941996591195
17476. yet implicit in each	movement was the death of millions perhaps hundreds of millions perhaps	you and me- and the experts.	5.796128177063497
17477. these men are not callous.	6.1146427327137625
17478. it is their job to think about the unthinkable.	6.898382406846716
17479. unanimously they believe	that the world would become a safer place if more of us- and more	russians and communist chinese too- thought about accidental	war.	3.2764102683896206
17480. the first systematic thinking about this pandora's box	within pandora's boxes was done four years ago by fred ikle a	frail meek-mannered swiss-born sociologist.	4.874202331231591
17481. he was and is with the	rand corporation a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the	u s air force.	3.6351629890383506
17482. his investigations made him the paul revere	of accidental war and safety procedures were enormously increased.	5.233049370588526
17483. in recent weeks as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal	by the kennedy administration basic united states strategy	has been modified- and large new sums allocated- to meet the accidental-war	danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible.	3.6584180974676794
17484. the	chain starts at bmews	in thule greenland.	6.3122183038668345
17485. its radar screens would register soviet	missiles shortly after they are launched against the united states.	3.9286631816847994
17486. bmews intelligence is simultaneously flashed to norad	in colorado springs	colorado for interpretation; to the sac command and control	post forty-five feet below the ground at offutt air force base near	omaha nebraska; to the joint war room of the joint chiefs	of staff in the pentagon and to the president.	4.696790085341974
17487. telephones	teletypes several kinds of radio systems and in some cases television	link all vital points.	3.8793715493908443
17488. alternate locations exist for all key command	centers.	6.369813526406495
17489. for last-ditch emergencies sac has alternate command	posts on kc-135 jet tankers.	3.6530443621729107
17490. multiple circuits routings and	frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible.	5.338423149073377
17491. the	same principle of redundancy applies to all communications on these	special networks.	3.7592352117662156
17492. and no messages can be transmitted on these circuits	until senders and receivers authenticate in advance by special	codes	that the messages actually come from their purported sources.	4.809837554569715
17493. additional	codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications.	4.516651275477423
17494. only the president is permitted to authorize the	use of nuclear weapons.	7.23750960021665
17495. but what if somebody decides	to break it?	5.089728515625536
17496.  the president cannot personally remove the safety	devices from every nuclear trigger.	5.676850661785348
17497. he makes the momentous decision.	5.065355285940697
17498. hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers	and to push the buttons.	6.484430671621643
17499. what if one or more of them turn irrational	or suddenly coolly decide to clobber the russians?	4.266055600442039
17500.  what if the president	himself in the language of the military goes ape?	7.099410581381695
17501. 	or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the soviets	without provocation?	3.626991457841105
17502.    nobody can be absolutely certain of	the answers.	7.084771979950038
17503. however the system is designed ingeniously and hopefully	so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war.	4.154341631712152
17504. even	the president cannot pick up his telephone and give a go order.	5.934799770189077
17505. even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike- the	go code.	4.876779332516552
17506. in an emergency he would receive available intelligence	on the gold-phone circuit.	6.324188071535498
17507. a system of gold- actually	yellow- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of	the secretary of defense the joint chiefs of staff the sac	commander and other key men.	3.3356539950396633
17508. all can be connected with the gold circuit	from their homes.	6.491377834340768
17509. all could help the president make his decision.	5.025019212763248
17510. the talk would not be in code but neither would it ramble.	5.741241096937546
17511. vital	questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda.	4.242921240985502
17512. officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured	me that the president's decision could be made and announced on the	gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from bmews.	5.099819319129285
17513. if communications work his decision would be instantly known	in all command posts that would originate the actual go order.	3.5105168281712076
17514. for	these centers too are on the gold circuit.	6.991068290022207
17515. they include the navy's	atlantic command at norfolk virginia which is in contact with	the polaris subs; nato headquarters in europe; air force	forward headquarters in europe and in the pacific which control	tactical fighters on ships and land bases; and sac which controls	long-range bombers and atlas missiles.	3.219784478053457
17516. let us look in on	one of these nerve centers- sac at omaha- and see what must	still happen before a wing of b-52 bombers could drop their h-bombs.	5.041484774452062
17517. the key man almost certainly would	be col william w wisman sac's senior controller.	3.30186431702504
17518. he	or his deputy or one of their seven assistants all full colonels	mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day.	5.411016973725325
17519. it is a quiet	but impressive room- 140 feet long thirty-nine feet wide twenty-one	feet high.	3.6346320482696752
17520. movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts	are crammed with intelligence information.	5.216935289485808
17521. and bill wisman forty-three	a farmer's son from beallsville ohio is a quiet but impressive	man.	3.654734029045798
17522. his eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown.	6.201108272778233
17523. his movements	and speech are precise clear and quick.	4.131094860343436
17524. no question ruffles him	or causes him to hesitate.	7.1468014262316535
17525. wisman who has had the chief controller's	job for four years calls the signals for a team operating	three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights switches and buttons.	3.3194260520800456
17526. at least a dozen men some armed are never far away from him.	7.1687553070967605
17527. in front of him is a gold phone.	5.568255239689397
17528. in emergencies the sac commander	gen thomas power or his deputies and their staff would occupy	a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above wisman	and his staff.	5.0712240015365735
17529. at general power's seat in the balcony there is	also a gold phone.	4.032881695549505
17530. general power would participate in the decision	making.	7.057212599405712
17531. wisman below would listen in and act.	4.508633661917878
17532. his consoles can give	him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and	with every sac aircraft.	5.654868849627047
17533. he need only pick up one of	the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left right next to the	big red button marked alert.	3.3186171366846233
17534. but wisman too does not	know the go code.	6.375731309115428
17535. he must take it from the red box.	5.580431777989877
17536. in point	of fact this is a beige box with a bright red door about one and a half	feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to	wisman's right.	5.2795452057245935
17537. the box is internally wired so the door can never	be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon.	3.0909432750038603
17538. now we must become vague for we are approaching	one of the nation's most guarded secrets.	5.963356210798135
17539. the codes in the red box-	there are several of them covering various contingencies- are contained	in a sealed x-ray-proof unique device.	3.0911253334862625
17540. they are supplied	a batch at a time by a secret source and are continually changed	by wisman or his staff at random intervals.	5.6923864919578655
17541. but even the contents	of wisman's box cannot start a war.	4.297408819808709
17542. they are mere fragments	just one portion of preprepared messages.	6.337233242111476
17543. what these fragments are	and how they activate the go order may not be revealed.	4.242617550985226
17544. the pieces must	be placed in the context of the prepared messages by wisman's staff.	5.297973756741009
17545. in addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures	which precede and follow the sending of the go messages again in special	codes each message also contains an internal authenticator	another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting	the real thing.	3.298459693221508
17546. i asked wisman what would happen if he broke	out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one.	5.910898333571968
17547. i'd wind	up full of .	4.649549656008843
17548. 38 bullet holes he said and there was no question that	he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers.	6.342808379078544
17549. now let	us imagine a wing of b-52's on alert near their positive control	points the spots on the map many miles from	soviet territory beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific	orders to proceed to their targets.	3.1908382265291317
17550. they too have fragments of	the go code with them.	6.201008102672774
17551. as wisman put it they have separate pieces	of the pie and we have the whole pie.	4.408007639124848
17552. once we send out the whole	pie they can put their pieces into it.	6.216926747440636
17553. unless we send out the whole	pie their pieces mean nothing.	4.249315603617959
17554. why does wisman's ever-changing	code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers?	5.943963933398768
17555. 	the answer is a cryptographic secret.	4.47842532936661
17556. at any rate three	men out of a six-man b-52 crew are required to copy down wisman's	go-to-war message.	6.1391117509495405
17557. each must match wisman's pie with the	fragment that he carries with him.	3.823631971603193
17558. all three must compare notes and agree	to go.	6.912127208697539
17559. after that it requires several minutes of concentrated	work including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum	of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber each	with another man beside him to help for an armed bomb to be released.	3.166242753837539
17560. unless all gadgets are properly operated- and the wires and seals	from the handles removed first- no damage can be done.	4.926559411012906
17561. suddenly however their posture changed and the game ended.	4.3861343889609286
17562. they	went as rigid as black statuary h six figures lean and tall and	angular went still.	4.871591657578671
17563. their heads were in the air sniffing.	6.426767919330333
17564. they all	swung at the same instant in the same direction.	8.339681236892272
17565. they saw it before	i did even with my binoculars.	4.453364381976466
17566. it was nothing more than a tiny distant	rain squall a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds	to the earth.	5.565604284117705
17567. in the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree	no more.	3.707635784189651
17568. a white man would not have seen it.	7.734964094069008
17569. the aborigines fastened	upon it with a concentration beyond pathos.	3.899281813523437
17570. watching they waited	until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant	across the dry burning land.	5.521556540546124
17571. at once the whole band set off at a lope.	5.0675439120763555
17572. they were chasing a rain cloud.	7.593531462597322
17573. they went after the squall	as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow.	3.8088766486036154
17574. i followed them	in the jeep and now they did not care.	6.889457282894906
17575. the games were over this	was life.	3.887374095468421
17576. occasionally for no reason that i could see they would suddenly	alter the angle of their trot.	6.403143003131067
17577. sometimes i guessed it was because	the rain squall had changed direction.	4.1849101924187515
17578. sometimes it was to skirt	a gulley.	9.374199176778056
17579. their gait is impossible to convey in words.	4.514011076362837
17580. it has nothing	of the proud stride of the trained runner about it it is not a lope	it is not done with style or verve.	6.091745915360637
17581. it is the gait of the human who	must run to live: arms dangling legs barely swinging over the ground	head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target	a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully	graceful.	3.3836368680733613
17582. it is a barely controlled skimming of the ground.	6.523693034844565
17583. they ran for three hours.	5.6397346258675976
17584. finally avoiding hummocks and seeking low	ground they intercepted the rain squall.	5.753775678142534
17585. for ten minutes they ran	beneath the squall raising their arms and for the first time shouting	and capering.	4.570030592411596
17586. then the wind died and the rain squall held steady.	7.042744929581146
17587. they were studying the ground.	5.662118486807852
17588. suddenly one of them shouted ran a	few feet bent forward and put his mouth to the ground.	5.986785918459753
17589. he had found	a depression with rain water in it.	4.379913430597563
17590. he bent down a black cranelike figure	and put his mouth to the ground.	5.578160265393424
17591. with a lordly and generous	gesture	the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows.	3.979681695971316
17592. the	other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle.	6.184477267104468
17593. in an instant	he had sucked it dry.	4.7498097446536836
17594. the aborigine lives on the cruelest land	i have ever seen.	5.309681324310268
17595. which does not mean that it is ugly.	6.688031860343265
17596. part of it	is of course.	8.419758338715397
17597. there are thousands of square miles of salt pan which	are hideous.	4.368157465814964
17598. they are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so	many centuries that there is no soil left but only deep bare ridges	fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty	feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand.	4.942954445141957
17599. such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality.	4.774485805644036
17600. but much of the land	which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable.	7.29683848138283
17601. it is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush has a peaceful quality	the hills roll softly.	3.5155846355513023
17602. the malignancy of such a landscape	has been beautifully described by the australian charles bean.	5.2547741577542215
17603. he	tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock	a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer.	3.574107973442417
17604. they went well-equipped	with everything except knowledge of the outback country.	6.827602628450269
17605. the countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle	slopes and soft gray tree-clumps.	3.280642558972836
17606. nothing appalling or horrible rushed	upon these men.	6.682168526917988
17607. there might have	been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps: only-	there was not.	4.096219425494524
17608. it might have rained any time; only- it did not.	6.640850165356299
17609. there might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise;	only- there was not.	4.863564141734169
17610. they lay with the birds hopping from branch	to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them.	5.589164664284876
17611. the white men died.	4.908862656749025
17612. and countless others like them have	died.	7.681167461472069
17613. even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of	men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly	lost direction were tortured by the heat driven mad by the constant	and unfulfilled promise of the landscape and who finally died.	3.0976443002870533
17614. the aborigine is not deceived; he knows that the land is hard	and pitiless.	5.693907233216783
17615. he knows that the economy of life in the outback	is awful.	5.120627171139454
17616. there is no room for error or waste.	7.174256590082279
17617. any organism that falters	or misperceives the signals or weakens is done.	3.8085304607721917
17618. i do not know	if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge but	i suspect that it can.	7.080973785899065
17619. perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his	odd air of dignity.	4.843506360871028
17620. seeing an aborigine	today is a difficult thing.	6.740818703562909
17621. many of them have drifted into the	cities and towns and seaports.	4.653295406700463
17622. others are confined to vast reservations	and not only does the australian government justifiably not wish	them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo but on their reservations they	are extremely fugitive shunning camps coming together only for corroborees	at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch-	which is very low indeed.	4.4974325982461645
17623. i persuaded an australian friend	who had lived outback for years to take me to see some aborigines	living in the bush.	3.6599196855227007
17624. it was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation	even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge	of the aborigines and their language.	5.689285252681928
17625. finally however the arrangements	were made and we drove out into the bush in a land rover.	4.199829973812374
17626. we	followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a	smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth.	5.589873250686484
17627. the rancher went a mile down this road and then when he reached a big	red boulder swung off the road.	3.275200496331783
17628. at once he started to glance toward	the instrument panel.	7.274519289812723
17629. it took me a moment to realize what was odd	about that panel: there was a gimbaled compass welded to it which rocked	gently back and forth as the land rover bounced about.	3.7156290106019707
17630. the rancher	was navigating his way across the flatland.	5.24272114589974
17631. do you always	navigate like this?	5.7721507737950954
17632.  i asked.	11.036555719764213
17633. once i get out on the flat i do.	5.561562431293234
17634. some chaps that know an	area well can make their way by landmarks h a tree here a wash here	a boulder there.	5.097046095784423
17635. but if you don't know the place like the palm of	your hand you'd better use a compass and the speedometer.	3.7982126164147645
17636. two miles	northeast then five miles southwest h that sort of thing.	6.533051192723947
17637. the landscape kept repeating itself.	3.869600779307555
17638. i would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was	hopeless.	6.246408414419399
17639. finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines.	4.78070156167181
17640. they	were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder: a man his lubra	and two children.	5.263590293802852
17641. the sun was not yet high and all of them were in	the small area	of shade cast by the boulder.	3.8543733904424187
17642. there was also a dog	a dingo dog.	7.945616714837764
17643. its ribs showed it was a yellow nondescript color	it suffered from a variety of sores hair had scabbed off its body in	patches.	3.8200099045404627
17644. it lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving	watching us carefully.	5.7356663703659025
17645. it struck me as a very bright and very malnourished	dog.	5.008682434608341
17646. no one patted the dog.	8.596036547280502
17647. it was not a pet.	6.826922624754739
17648. the buggers love shade the rancher said.	5.272328866367414
17649. i suppose	because it saves them some loss of body water.	4.170420535529062
17650. they'll move around	that rock all day following the shade.	5.780951794324562
17651. during the hottest part of	the day of course the sun comes straight down and there isn't any	shade.	4.185893115645127
17652. we drove close to the boulder stopped the land rover	and walked over toward the family.	6.119100115052099
17653. the man was leaning against	the rock.	4.563694334983064
17654. he gazed away from us as we approached.	6.84891996464034
17655. he was over	six feet tall and very thin.	4.763420327497549
17656. his legs were narrow and very long.	7.2161923960311904
17657. every	bone and muscle in his body showed but he did not give the appearance	of starving.	4.047937675036572
17658. he had long black hair and a wispy beard.	7.404707652979314
17659. the ridges	over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut.	3.2845878019058685
17660. there was something	about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds	to realize what.	6.098973440584365
17661. it was not merely that flies were crawling over his	face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into	his eye sockets.	3.572432985386324
17662. a fly would crawl down the bulging forehead into	the socket of the eye walk along the man's lashes and across the wet	surface of the eyeball and the eye did not blink.	4.773948249746514
17663. the australian	and i both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered	by insects but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine.	2.998535035835688
17664. i turned to look at the lubra.	9.132472310796826
17665. she remained squatting on her heels	all the time we were there; like the man she was entirely naked.	3.8735378496817234
17666. her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family	possessions which were placed in front of her.	5.906155581387394
17667. there were two rubbing	sticks for making fire two stones shaped roughly like knives a woven-root	container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead	body of some rodent.	3.3240949030376514
17668. there was also a long wooden spear and a woomera	a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity	and high accuracy.	5.363436501687072
17669. there was also a boomerang elaborately carved.	5.391566044667663
17670. everything	was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects	seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless.	6.623602715748426
17671. the two children both boys wandered around the australian	and me for a few moments and then returned to their work.	3.92004630848066
17672. they squatted	on their heels with their heads bent far forward their eyes only	a few inches from the ground.	5.101227823719561
17673. they had located the runway of a colony	of ants and as the ants came out of the ground the boys picked them	up one at a time and pinched them dead.	4.106715230066834
17674. the tiny bodies dropped onto	a dry leaf made a pile as big as a small apple.	4.676000649960773
17675. the odor	here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines.	3.4869063866422065
17676. the smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant.	5.626060595077448
17677. it was also	subtly familiar for it was the odor of the human body but multiplied	innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed.	4.725967836872174
17678. one's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant.	6.489527213719333
17679. but that is a cliche and a dishonest one.	5.375052270944227
17680. the smell is sexual but	so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it.	5.197150022458628
17681. their	skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost	the consistency of a second skin.	3.640574289506773
17682. they roll at night in ashes to keep	warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it.	5.171524496783464
17683. in spots	such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and i realized	the aborigines were much darker than they appeared; as if the coating	of sweat dirt and ashes were a cosmetic.	3.2047162606874235
17684. the boys had beautiful	dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies	and blinked their eyes.	4.733293316155086
17685. that smell is something eh mate?	5.197757073723371
17686. 	the australian asked.	7.9068494396104985
17687. they swear that every person smells	different and every family smells different from every other.	3.6774396619241685
17688. at the	corroborees when they get to dancing and sweating you'll see	them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good	smell.	5.744125818512859
17689. idje here and he nodded at the man is said to have	great odor.	4.239395470804093
17690. the stink is all the same to me but i really think they	can make one another out blindfolded.	5.2698253700883315
17691. here idje you	fella like tabac?	5.522783333390015
17692.  he said sharply.	11.270990447425797
17693. idje still stared over our shoulders	at the horizon.	4.02031540508551
17694. the australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin	i could understand and spoke strange words from deep in his chest.	4.7156473475025065
17695. it was a fortunate time in which to build for the seventeenth	century was a great period in persian art.	4.233636427325751
17696. the architects the tile	and carpet makers the potters painters calligraphers and metalsmiths	worked through abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich	the city.	4.520928829883112
17697. travelers entering from the desert were confounded by	what must have seemed an illusion: a great garden filled with nightingales	and roses cut by canals and terraced promenades studded with	water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening	blue curves of a hundred domes.	3.011757869368589
17698. at the heart of all of this was the square	which one such traveler declared to be as spacious as pleasant	and aromatick a market as any in the universe.	6.072832426856454
17699. in time isfahan	came to be known as half the world isfahan nisf-i-jahan.	4.216072851596487
17700. in the early eighteenth century this fantastic city then the	size of london started to decline.	5.939101067904997
17701. the afghans invaded; the safavids	fell from power; the capital went elsewhere; the desert encroached.	3.0160613661044877
17702. isfahan became more of a legend than a place and now it is	for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of	old persia and sometimes of the east.	5.2163163595915165
17703. they think of it as a kind of	spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor.	4.717370621512506
17704. those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky	at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight.	5.515569471562011
17705. but even for them it	remains a museum or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb	a tomb in which persia lies well preserved but indeed dead.	3.7370993488538358
17706. everyone	is ready to grant the persians their history but almost no one is	willing to acknowledge their present.	5.211631257296764
17707. it seems that for persia and	especially for this city there are only two times: the glorious past	and the corrupt depressing sterile present.	3.776833399365157
17708. the one apparent connection	between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other	have survived and which naturally enough are called historical monuments.	4.939400561462151
17709. however just as all the buildings have not fallen and	flowed back to their original mud so the values which wanted them	and saw that they were built have not all disappeared.	3.596822702024677
17710. the values and	talents which made the tile and the dome the rug the poem and the miniature	continue in certain social institutions which rise above the	ordinary life of this city as the great buildings rise above blank walls	and dirty lanes.	4.468805410658002
17711. often too the social institutions are housed	in these pavilions and palaces and bridges for these great structures	are not simply historical monuments; they are the places where	persians live.	3.332536038880778
17712. the promenade for example continues to take	place on the chahar bagh a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees	that now serves as the city's principal street.	4.318673177628573
17713. ?	7.781497302878112
17714. t takes place	as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the khaju bridge	and also in the gardens of the square.	5.506409547238332
17715. on fridays the day when	many persians relax with poetry talk and a samovar people do not	it is true stream into chehel sotun- a pavilion and garden built	by shah abbas 2 in the seventeenth century- but they do retire	into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley	which are smaller more humble copies of the former.	3.0575546688530095
17716. and of course	religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques and commercial	life- very much a social institution- in the bazaar.	5.463556182068789
17717. those	three other great activities of the persians the bath the teahouse	and the zur khaneh	and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics	do not take place in buildings	to which entrance tickets are sold but some of them occupy splendid	examples of persian domestic architecture: long domed chalk-white	rooms with daises of turquoise tile their end walls cut through	to the orchards and the sky by open arches.	3.01043539261335
17718. but more important	and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often	do not see is that these places and activities are often the settings	in which persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities.	4.856753048012795
17719. water air fruit poetry music the human form- these things	are important to persians and they experience them with an intense	and discriminating awareness.	3.418742737150975
17720. i should like by the way to make	it clear that i am not using the word persians carelessly.	7.010800649305763
17721. i don't mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations like	a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool.	3.3098764854590037
17722. these things	are important to almost all persians and perhaps most important to	the most ordinary.	5.824350015567547
17723. the men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's	night are as often as not the lutihaw mustachioed toughs	who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons brothels	and teahouses.	3.5459404531091723
17724. a few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord	who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring	famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor.	5.567572886622838
17725. not long	ago an acquaintance a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw	of the city stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks.	3.4123161776427215
17726. the air he said was just right; a cigarette would taste particularly	good.	5.583367855416973
17727. i really didn't know what he meant.	4.8346322950885625
17728. it was a nice day	granted.	9.331960903209053
17729. but he knew; he sniffed the air and licked it on his	lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage.	3.5214415630733567
17730. the natural world	then plus poetry and some kinds of art receives from the most ordinary	of persians a great deal of attention.	5.260184630868891
17731. the line of an eyebrow	the color of the skin a ghazal from hafiz the purity of spring water	the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of	a pavilion- these things are noticed judged and valued.	2.954661348551324
17732. nowhere	in isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the persians shown so	well as during the promenade at the khaju bridge.	5.3840819663997
17733. there has probably	always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the	city.	4.246465024800554
17734. for one thing there is a natural belt of rock across the river	bed; for another it was here that one of the old caravan routes came	in.	6.556651431717557
17735. it was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans	and also to make a pleasance for the city that shah abbas 2	in about 1657 built of sun-baked brick tile and stone the present	bridge.	3.624087067081916
17736. it is a splendid structure.	8.427887141952354
17737. from upstream it looks like a	long arcaded box laid across the river; from downstream where the	water level is much lower it is a high elaborately facaded pavilion.	3.557517774544661
17738. the top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from	each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile.	4.720808513415344
17739. at either end and	in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed	and capacious as church apses.	3.4394957478224124
17740. here in the old days- when they	had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks- sat the king and	his court while priests soldiers and other members of the party lounged	in the smaller alcoves between.	5.808257428482971
17741. below twenty vaults tunnel	through the understructure of the bridge.	4.165828482005489
17742. these are traversed by	another line of vaults and thus rooms arched on all four sides are	formed.	5.525271863184004
17743. down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing	vista like a visual echo of piers and arches while the vaults fronting	upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise the mountains and	river pools.	3.475043375156244
17744. here on the hottest day it is cool beneath the stone	and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the	vaults.	5.874896333873895
17745. on the downstream or pavilion side these vaults	give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself.	3.613683194455269
17746. from the	terraces- eighteen in all- broad flights of steps descend into the	water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river.	5.139724008318954
17747. out of water brick and tile they have made far more than just a	bridge.	4.7478260907453755
17748. on spring and summer evenings people leave their shops	and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge.	6.031697713592031
17749. it	is a great spectacle.	6.356668405180652
17750. the bridge itself rises up from the river light-flared	and enormous like the outdoor set for an epic opera.	5.1521874239919265
17751. crowds	press along the terraces down the steps in and out of the arcades	massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege.	3.996423049846627
17752. all kinds	come to walk in the promenade: merchants from the bazaar bickering	over a deal; a bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket; dervishes	who stand with the stillness of the blind their eyes filmed with	rheum and visions; the old kajar princes arriving in their ancient	limousines; students civil servants beggars musicians hawkers	and clowns.	4.219389928432838
17753. families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on	carpets around a samovar.	4.438135561766446
17754. below people line the steps as though on	bleachers to watch the sky and river.	6.181720029961731
17755. above in the tiled prosceniums	of the alcoves boys sing the ghazals of hafiz and saadi while at	the very bottom in the vaults the toughs and blades of the city hoot	and bang their drums drink arak play dice and dance.	3.06155617062324
17756. here	in an evening persians enjoy many of the things which are important	to them: poetry water the moon a beautiful face.	5.766475945511947
17757. to a stranger	their delight in these things may seem paradoxical for persians chase	the golden calf as much as any people.	3.9281774719113605
17758. many of them moreover are	beginning to complain about the scarcity of western amusements and to	ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant the mullah and the peasant.	5.38510661059242
17759. nonetheless they take time out- much time- from the game of	grab and these new western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks.	3.739067469125201
17760. above all they will stop in the middle of anything anywhere	to hear or quote some poetry.	6.3157720770262396
17761. poetry in persian life is far	more than a common ground on which- in a society deeply fissured by	antagonisms- all may stand.	3.41890474933065
17762. it contains in fact their whole outlook	on life.	7.178815510712886
17763. and it is expressed at least to their taste in a perfect	form.	4.725433747987657
17764. poetry for a persian is nothing less than truth and beauty.	6.289578636959449
17765. in most western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the	libraries and museums.	3.7113029276736
17766. in persia where practically speaking there	are no museums or libraries or for that matter hardly any books the	twins run free.	5.087208051737677
17767. it is perhaps difficult to conceive but imagine	that tonight on london bridge the teddy boys of the east end	will gather to sing marlowe herrick shakespeare and perhaps some	lyrics of their own.	3.307149683047723
17768. that at any rate is what happens at the khaju	bridge.	7.46613128492463
17769. boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the	top arcade.	4.010705740027897
17770. here in these little rooms- or stages arched open to	the sky and river- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they	may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which persian	music is divided.	5.541299391248489
17771. each mode is believed to have a specific attribute-	one inducing pleasure another generosity another love and so	on to include all of the emotions.	4.014948138414266
17772. the singer simply matches the poem	to a mode; for example the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk	poem: they brought me news that spring is in the plains and	ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains; go tell his aged mother	that her son fought with a thousand foes and he was one.	4.641570047456677
17773. or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet: know	ye fair folk who dwell on earth or shall hereafter come to birth that	here with dust upon his eyes iraj the sweet-tongued singer lies.	3.2468455955306257
17774. in this true lover's tomb interred a world of love lies sepulchred	h.	6.5468021890534525
17775. these songs	are limited to a range of two octaves.	4.650769479657534
17776. yet within this	limitation there is an astonishing variety: design as intricate as	that in the carpet or miniature with the melodic line like the painted	or woven line often flowing into an arabesque.	4.7662111514424765
17777. die frist ist um und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben jahr the	maestro quoted the flying dutchman as he told of his career	and wanderings explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred	in his life several times.	2.914853309744413
17778. the music director of the pittsburgh	symphony orchestra william steinberg has molded his group	into a prominent musical organization which is his life.	5.123363407141761
17779. when he	added to his pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the london	philharmonic orchestra in 1958 he conducted one hundred fifty concerts	within nine months commuting between the two cities.	3.425214000778854
17780. this	schedule became too strenuous even for the energetic and conscientious	mr steinberg.	5.831813625442928
17781. his london contract was rescinded and now he	explains cheerfully as a bright smile lightens his intense mobile face	i conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts!   our	meeting took place in may 1961 during one of the maestro's stop-overs	in new york before he left for europe.	3.304858499071574
17782. as we began to converse	in the lounge of his fifth avenue hotel his restlessness and	sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent.	5.336086200880212
17783. seeking	an obscure dark relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise	suffused with afternoon sunshine he asked if the soft background music	could be turned off.	3.0726804921325033
17784. unfortunately it was muzak which automatically	is piped into the public rooms and which nolens volens had to	be endured.	5.242670554014709
17785. as he talked about himself time and again stuffing and	dragging on his pipe steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried	feeling grew faint and was dispelled.	3.5981482081802705
17786. did he come from a musical	family?	8.426485105852471
17787.  yes: though not professional musicians they were a	music-loving family.	3.8894424161447403
17788. in his native cologne where his mother taught	him to play the piano he was able to read notes before he learned the	alphabet.	5.987553428162929
17789. she even devised a system of colors whereby the boy could	easily distinguish the different note values.	3.9017022532319907
17790. when he started school	at the age of five-and-a-half he could not understand why the alphabet	begins with the letter a instead of c as in the scale.	5.99384195903074
17791. because	like many other children he intensely disliked practicing czerny	etudes he composed his own studies.	3.46937112909744
17792. when he was eight he began	violin lessons.	8.303341243180164
17793. soon he was playing in the cologne municipal orchestra	and during world war 1 when musicians were scarce he	joined the opera orchestra as well.	3.8747254323232236
17794. steinberg claims that these early	years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career.	5.480607342785099
17795. by observing the conductor he says with a twinkle in his	eyes i learned how not to conduct.	3.82415271483278
17796. the musician ran away	from school when he was fifteen but this escapade did not save him	from the gymnasium.	5.1713749740917985
17797. simultaneously he pursued his musical studies	at the conservatory receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony	as well in the violin and piano.	3.288383349762745
17798. his professional career began when	he was twenty; he became otto klemperer's personal assistant	at the cologne opera and a year later was promoted to the position	of regular conductor.	4.756953888110166
17799. wasn't this an unusually young age to	fill such a responsible post?	3.646603414288556
17800.  yes the maestro assented.	9.519092826307862
17801. had	he always wished to be a conductor?	5.26950798679506
17802.  no originally he had hoped	to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such.	5.635720496169551
17803. however	when he assumed the duties of a conductor he relinquished his career	as a pianist.	3.625758708409861
17804. five years were spent with the cologne opera	after which he was called to prague by alexander von zemlinsky teacher	of arnold scho^nberg and erich korngold.	5.320511422241972
17805. in 1927 he succeeded	zemlinsky as opera director of the german theater at prague.	4.297257452182777
17806. during his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the berlin	state opera.	6.310956814902432
17807. two years later he became director of the frankfurt opera	where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the	rise of the hitler regime.	3.9220507331901295
17808. during these years the youthful conductor	had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in germany.	6.481137852981171
17809. he had presented the first german performances of puccini's	manon lescaut and de falla's	la vida breve.	3.6947948808806848
17810. the frankfurt	years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of berg's	wozzek soon after the berlin premiere under erich kleiber	and the world premiere of scho^nberg's von heute auf morgen.	4.437621445446055
17811. at the outset of his career steinberg had dedicated himself to the	advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a scho^nberg work	every year.	3.815993530613026
17812. in frankfurt too he directed the museum and opera	house concerts which in addition to the standard repertoire featured	novelties like erdmann's piano concerto and mahler's sixth	symphony.	4.990645984244312
17813. because of the political upheaval in germany in the	1930's	steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the jewish	community.	4.1818299061000666
17814. through the frankfurt jewish kulturbund he began	to give sonata recitals in synagogues with cellist emanuel feuermann.	5.089976427041358
17815. as more and more jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional	organizations steinberg united them into the frankfurt kulturbund	orchestra which also gave guest performances in other german	cities.	3.4292538825371293
17816. in 1936 he accepted the leadership of the berlin kulturbund.	6.986758370959049
17817. in the fall of that year the best musicians of the berlin	and frankfurt kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts	of bronislaw hubermann and steinberg to become the palestine	orchestra- now known as the israel philharmonic orchestra- with	steinberg as founder-conductor.	3.4307592406016685
17818. in 1938 at the insistence	of arturo toscanini steinberg left germany for the united states	by way of switzerland.	5.545410886774003
17819. after he had spent the first three years	in new york as associate conductor at toscanini's invitation of	the nbc orchestra he made numerous guest appearances throughout	the united states and latin america.	3.699521542074801
17820. in 1945 he became conductor	of the buffalo philharmonic.	6.312450354598124
17821. seven years later he was asked to become	director of the pittsburgh symphony.	4.642367917630513
17822. since 1944 he has also conducted	regularly at the san francisco opera where he made his debut	with a memorable performance of verdi's falstaff.	5.622355514081561
17823. in recent	years he has traveled widely in europe conducting in italy france	austria and switzerland.	3.729959793697474
17824. he returned to germany for the first	time in 1953 where he has since conducted in cologne frankfurt	and berlin.	5.906583889156999
17825. where in europe was he going now?	5.076335966895729
17826.    first	of all to italy for a short vacation- forte dei marmi a place	he loves.	5.182385889850644
17827. since it is not far from viareggio he will visit puccini's	house as he never fails to do to pay his respects to the memory	of the composer of la boheme which he considers one of puccini's	masterpieces.	3.9396097581822302
17828. steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about	italy: rome is my second home.	5.7743999326153
17829. i consider it the center of the	world and make it a point to be there once a year.	5.015238617869344
17830. he will conduct	two concerts at the accademia di santa cecilia as well as concerts	in munich and cologne.	5.952065762891682
17831. then i return to the united states	for engagements at the hollywood bowl and in philadelphia he	added.	4.624123230472923
17832. the forthcoming season in pittsburgh also promises to	be of unusual interest.	5.002805638127031
17833. there will be premieres of new works made possible	through ford foundation commissions: carlisle floyd's mystery	with phyllis curtin as soprano soloist.	3.44996924956842
17834. other world premieres	will be gardner read's third symphony and burle marx's	samba concertante.	5.4121243248357525
17835. and next year we will do- also	a ford commission- a piano concerto by elliott carter with jacob	lateiner as soloist.	3.3143561457397896
17836. of course i shall conduct mahler and bruckner	works in the coming season as usual.	6.341868691590482
17837. we'll play bruckner's	fifth symphony in the original version and mahler's seventh-	the least accessible known and played of mahler's works.	3.227542545481271
17838. my pittsburghers	have become real addicts to mahler and bruckner.	6.159154811501912
17839. he added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters	on tour especially mahler's first and fourth symphonies and	das lied von der erde and bruckner's sixth- which is rarely	played- and seventh.	3.2885196720098024
17840. bruckner's eighth he refers to as my	travel symphony.	5.965224929005225
17841. he recalled that in california after a critic	had attacked him for still trying to sell bruckner to the americans	the public's response at the next concert was a standing ovation.	3.403945902945061
17842. now that bruno walter is virtually in retirement and	my dear friend dimitri mitropoulos is no longer with us i am probably	the only one- with the possible exception of leonard bernstein-	who has this special affinity for and champions the works of bruckner	and mahler.	4.701186091043787
17843. since he introduces so much modern music	i could not resist asking how he felt about it.	4.016180673012134
17844. there was	always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era	in which it was created.	6.31582952944426
17845. but i usually stick to the old phrase:	'ich habe ein amt aber keine meinung	.	3.953107741614892
17846. i consider it to be my	job to expose the public to what is being written today.	7.469393349791872
17847. with	all his musical activities did he have the time and inclination to	do anything else?	4.019190589125473
17848.  he had just paid a brief visit to the frick collection	to admire his favorite paintings by rembrandt and franz hals.	5.517778273300073
17849. he was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired claude lorrain	but reminisced with pleasure over a poussin exhibit he had been able	to see in paris a year ago.	3.7176443861266004
17850. and how did he feel about modern	art?	7.622456517815956
17851.  again steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he	was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments.	3.565291888345755
17852. as my wife puts	it he said again with a twinkle in his eyes all you know is	your music.	5.852414877137501
17853. but after all you never learned anything else!	what did he do for relaxation?	4.144197367565386
17854.  like his late colleague mitropoulos	he reads mystery stories in particular sir arthur conan doyle.	5.5462114439876995
17855. he cited heine and stendhal as favorites in literature.	4.113310622105111
17856. but his prime interest apart from music he insisted seriously was	his family- his wife daughter and son.	5.503663819610937
17857. at the moment he was excited	about his son's having received the prix de rome in archaeology	and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation	of an etruscan tomb.	3.2867007509980057
17858. both children are musical and my wife is	a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgment.	5.575525287269849
17859. is the attitude of german youth comparable to that of the	angry	young men' of england?	4.691997871730854
17860.  was the topic for a round-table discussion	at the bayerische rundfunk in munich.	5.733227171768668
17861. i was chairman	the only not youthful participant.	4.827210107549373
17862. since attack serves to stimulate	interest in broadcasts i added to my opening statement a sentence in	which i claimed that german youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which	is a necessary ingredient of anger and might be classified as uninterested	and bored rather than angry.	4.58102542420952
17863. i was far from convinced of the	truth of my statement but could not think of anything that might evoke	responses more quickly.	3.79648301650617
17864. it is easy for you to talk;	countered a twenty year old law student you travel around the world.	5.932647523241367
17865. we would like to do that too.	6.697776951450349
17866. but you want a job guaranteed	when you return i continued my attack.	6.195973149620775
17867. you must have	some security said a young clerk.	5.0989064643942426
17868. when i mentioned that	for my first long voyage i did not even have the money for the return	fare but had trusted to luck that i would earn a sufficient amount	the young people looked at me doubtingly.	5.377290894406266
17869. one girl expressed what was	obviously in their minds.	4.619849452985549
17870. would you advise us to act the	same way?	7.301687074811471
17871.  you might have failed.	7.624566208634332
17872. i think it is rather foolhardy to	trust to luck.	7.897849826754585
17873. others mentioned that i might have had to	ask	friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign	country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international	understanding.	3.4074529657048527
17874. the debate needed no additional controversy	and soon i could ask each individually what he expected from life what	his hopes were and what his fears.	4.661167909288669
17875. though the four boys and	two girls the youngest nineteen years of age the oldest twenty-four	came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal	interests there was surprising agreement among them.	3.527709314606096
17876. what they	wished for most was security; what they feared most was war or political	instability in their own country.	5.634872367055062
17877. the ideal home they	agreed would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to	five rooms just enough for a family consisting of husband wife and	two children.	3.3955350006797462
17878. no one wanted a larger family or no children and none	hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would	be satisfactory.	5.189174842372033
17879. all expressed interest in world affairs	but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest.	3.9179397108117398
17880. once again as in the days of the founding fathers america	faces a stern test.	7.61501829040925
17881. that test as president kennedy forthrightly	depicted it in his state of the union message will determine whether	a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure.	3.947092576399469
17882. it is well then that in this hour both of national peril	and of national opportunity we can take counsel with the men who	made the nation.	5.5008256247507905
17883. incapable of self-delusion the founding fathers	found the crisis of their time to be equally grave and yet they had	confidence that america would surmount it and that a republic of free	peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty.	3.463277821617383
17884. seven founders- george washington benjamin franklin	john adams thomas jefferson alexander hamilton james	madison and john jay- determined the destinies of the new nation.	5.244623302836298
17885. in certain respects their task was incomparably greater than ours today	for there was nobody before them to show them the way.	3.4795735528269276
17886. as madison	commented to jefferson in 1789 we are in a wilderness without	a single footstep to guide us.	5.7810244763171275
17887. our successors will have an easier task.	5.257012942947555
17888. they thought of themselves to use jefferson's words	as the argonauts who had lived in the heroic age.	6.085827477534481
17889. accordingly	they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential	sources for posterity.	3.5340395383475185
17890. their writings assume more than dramatic or	patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in	which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but rather	as washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen	that with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved.	4.598081415784498
17891. strong men with strong opinions frank to the point	of being refreshingly indiscreet the founding seven were essentially	congenial minds and their agreements with each other were more consequential	than their differences.	3.186880486242348
17892. even though in most cases the completion	of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off	enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing	a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual	feats of winning american independence and founding a new nation.	4.867601675273093
17893. before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember	that their separate careers were extraordinary.	4.13328889762389
17894. certainly no other	seven american statesmen from any later period achieved so much in	so concentrated a span of years.	5.311451598821007
17895. eldest of the seven benjamin	franklin a new englander transplanted to philadelphia wrote the	most dazzling success story in our history.	3.390115587621849
17896. the young printer's apprentice	achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields as editor	and publisher scientist inventor philanthropist and statesman.	4.532119589925027
17897. author of the albany plan of union which had it been adopted might	have avoided the revolution he fought the colonists' front-line	battles in london negotiated the treaty of alliance with france and	the peace that ended the war headed the state government of pennsylvania	and exercised an important moderating influence at the federal	convention.	3.125002531701014
17898. on a military mission for his native virginia	the youthful george washington touched off the french and indian	war then guarded his colony's frontier as head of its militia.	5.317588631477721
17899. commanding the continental army for six long years of the revolution	he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory.	3.9947626043509343
17900. retiring	to his beloved mount vernon he returned to preside over the federal	convention and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected	president.	5.655073897567829
17901. during his two terms the constitution was tested and	found workable strong national policies were inaugurated and the	traditions and powers of the presidential office firmly fixed.	3.372401758623003
17902. john adams fashioned much of pre-revolutionary radical ideology wrote	the constitution of his home state of massachusetts negotiated	with franklin and jay the peace with britain and served as our first	vice president and our second president.	5.024578333004842
17903. his political	opponent and lifetime friend thomas jefferson achieved immortality	through his authorship of the declaration of independence but	equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted	in his native virginia his role as father of our territorial system	and his acquisition of the louisiana territory during his first	term as president.	3.009310927520935
17904. during the greater part of jefferson's	career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow virginian james	madison eight years his junior.	5.464734135086155
17905. the active sponsor of jefferson's	measure for religious liberty in virginia madison played the most	influential single role in the drafting of the constitution and in	securing its ratification in virginia founded the first political	party in american history and as jefferson's secretary of state	and his successor in the presidency guided the nation through the	troubled years of our second war with britain.	3.0248965705185085
17906. if franklin was	an authentic genius then alexander hamilton with his exceptional	precocity consuming energy and high ambition was a political prodigy.	5.095317153602979
17907. his revolutionary pamphlets published when he was only 19 quickly	brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders.	4.303091993758388
17908. principal author	of the federalist he swung new york over from opposition	to the constitution to ratification almost single-handedly.	5.0583894724141345
17909. his	collaboration with washington begun when he was the general's aide	during the revolution was resumed when he entered the first cabinet	as secretary of the treasury.	4.012562303920694
17910. his bold fiscal program and his broad	interpretation of the constitution stand as durable contributions.	5.580951589192894
17911. less dazzling than hamilton less eloquent than jefferson	john jay commands an equally high rank among the founding fathers.	3.475232627168484
17912. he served as president of the continental congress.	8.227869559921654
17913. he played	the leading role in negotiating the treaty with great britain that	ended the revolution and directed america's foreign affairs throughout	the confederation period.	3.2808275386171233
17914. as first chief justice his strong	nationalist opinions anticipated john marshall.	5.974865507297065
17915. he ended his public	career as a two-term governor of new york.	4.002711724223259
17916. these seven founders	constituted an intellectual and social elite the most respectable	and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed.	5.0774155543106465
17917. their	social status was achieved in some cases by birth as with washington	jefferson and jay; in others by business and professional acumen	as with franklin and adams or in hamilton's case by an influential	marriage.	3.1515467585178145
17918. unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals	in underdeveloped nations of our own day they commanded both prestige	and influence before the revolution started.	5.857272050443957
17919. as different	physically as the tall angular jefferson was from the chubby rotund	adams the seven were striking individualists.	3.656764522732751
17920. ardent opinionated	even obstinate they were amazingly articulate wrote their own copy	and were masters of phrasemaking.	4.873721392280788
17921. capable of enduring friendships	they were also stout controversialists who could write with	a drop of vitriol on their pens.	3.396879576159142
17922. john adams dismissed john dickinson	who voted against the declaration of independence as a certain	great fortune and piddling genius.	5.599329043447668
17923. washington castigated his	critic general conway as being capable of all the meanness of intrigue	to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity.	3.4799772264830735
17924. and	hamilton who felt it a religious duty to oppose aaron burr's	political ambitions would have been a better actuarial risk had	he shown more literary restraint.	5.353105121032629
17925. the seven founders were	completely dedicated to the public service.	4.34701969378952
17926. madison once remarked:	my life has been so much a public one a comment which fits the	careers of the other six.	5.550899922169987
17927. franklin retired from editing and publishing	at the age of 42 and for the next forty-two years devoted himself	to public scientific and philanthropic interests.	3.7762292840872917
17928. washington never	had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved	best plantation management.	6.092796477962231
17929. he served as commander in chief during	the revolution without compensation.	4.233588470675774
17930. john adams took	to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor jeremiah gridley	to pursue the study of the law rather than the gain of it.	6.104563224491383
17931. in	taking account of seventeen years of law practice adams concluded	that no lawyer in america ever did so much business as i did	and for so little profit.	3.2876310136342393
17932. when the revolution broke out he along	with jefferson and jay abandoned his career at the bar with considerable	financial sacrifice.	5.61229328804085
17933. hamilton poorest of the seven	gave up a brilliant law practice to enter washington's cabinet.	3.714789615911265
17934. while he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of	the government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends.	5.7722814283993555
17935. if you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars he wrote	one friend in 1791 when he was secretary of the treasury.	4.4018352968838546
17936. to	support his large family hamilton went back to the law after each spell	of public service.	5.659682483934444
17937. talleyrand passed his new york law office one	night on the way to a party.	4.453344748139984
17938. hamilton was bent over his desk drafting	a legal paper by the light of a candle.	6.118525771346414
17939. i have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune	of his country but now is working all night in order to support his	family he reflected.	4.121672217661977
17940. all seven combined ardent devotion	to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality.	6.040681691309072
17941. john	adams asserted in the continental congress' declaration of	rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their	charters the british constitution and the common law and jefferson	appealed in the declaration of independence to the tribunal of	the world for support of a revolution justified by the laws of	nature and of nature's god.	3.299741791138972
17942. they fought hard but they were	forgiving to former foes and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures	from confiscating tory property in violation of the treaty of	1783.	5.031946159967265
17943. this sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified	in an exchange of letters between john jay and a tory refugee	peter van schaack.	3.1663105009637706
17944. jay had participated in the decision that exiled	his old friend van schaack.	6.148771153655344
17945. yet when at war's end the ex-tory	made the first move to resume correspondence jay wrote him from	paris where he was negotiating the peace settlement:	as	an independent american i considered all who were not for us and you	amongst the rest as against us yet be assured that john jay never	ceased to be the friend of peter van schaack.	3.2250605821435228
17946. the latter	in turn assured him that were i arraigned at the bar and you my	judge i should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause.	4.918146145703684
17947. all seven recognized that independence was but the first	step toward building a nation.	4.0168029725919485
17948. we have now a national character	to establish washington wrote in 1783.	6.504596681319851
17949. think continentally	hamilton counseled the young nation.	4.681189766488489
17950. this new force love of country	super-imposed upon- if not displacing- affectionate ties to one's	own state was epitomized by washington.	4.878713751769829
17951. his first inaugural	address speaks of my country whose voice i can never hear but with	veneration and love.	3.592794210536533
17952. all sought the fruition of that nationalism	in a federal government with substantial powers.	5.806867184037983
17953. save jefferson	all participated in the framing or ratification of the federal	constitution.	4.149280970557208
17954. they supported it not as a perfect instrument but as	the best obtainable.	6.167649809429243
17955. historians have traditionally regarded the great	debates of the seventeen nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized	vs limited government with hamilton and the nationalists	supporting the former and jefferson and madison upholding the latter	position.	3.0413513321351213
17956. the state's rights position was formulated by	jefferson and madison in the kentucky and virginia resolves but	in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better	hamiltonians than jeffersonians.	4.2546910261196915
17957. in purchasing louisiana jefferson	had to adopt hamilton's broad construction of the constitution	and so did madison in advocating the rechartering of hamilton's	bank which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception and in	adopting a hamiltonian protective tariff.	3.0979683285003135
17958. indeed the old jeffersonians	were far more atune to the hamilton-oriented whigs than they	were to the jacksonian democrats.	5.382086577172632
17959. when in 1832 the south	carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition	which madison had advanced in his old virginia resolve they elicited	no encouragement from that senior statesman.	3.4494352479241175
17960. in his political testament	advice to my country penned just before his death madison	expressed the wish that the union of the states be cherished	and perpetuated.	5.829690481099243
17961. let the open enemy to it be regarded as a pandora	with her box opened; and the disguised one as the serpent creeping	with his deadly wiles into paradise.	3.5116786802553843
17962. nostalgic yankee	readers of erskine caldwell are today informed by proud georgians	that tobacco road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway over	which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the	dow-jones average than with the cotton crop.	4.2725587507936025
17963. thus we are compelled	to face the urbanization of the south- an urbanization which despite	its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the southern culture	has been utterly ignored by the bulk of southern writers.	3.2134091502074233
17964. indeed it	seems that only in today's southern fiction does tobacco road	with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint	juleps continue to live- but only as a weary overexploited phantom.	4.714747793346483
17965. those writers known collectively as the southern school	have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize;	according to many critics in fact the south has led the north	in literature since the civil war both quantitatively and qualitatively.	3.4655588297003046
17966. such writers as william faulkner and robert penn warren	have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum	renaissance.	5.8593057950568275
17967. it is interesting however that despite this	strong upsurge in southern writing almost none of the writers has	forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel	sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the	season's cotton and tobacco crops; of the stereotyped negro servants	chanting hymns as they plow the fields; of these and a host of	other antiquated legends that deny the south its progressive leaps	of the past century.	2.973075132147946
17968. this is not to say that the south is no longer	agrarian; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification.	7.304213177665829
17969. but the south is and has been for the past century engaged	in a wide-sweeping urbanization which oddly enough is not reflected	in its literature.	4.148156222674543
17970. in 1900 the south was only 15% urban;	in 1950 it had become 47.	5.718333866115187
17971. in a mere half-century the south	has more than tripled its urban status.	3.981017774166998
17972. there is a new south emerging	a south losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with	the rapidity of an avalanche- especially within recent decades.	5.424301370687521
17973. as	the new south snowballs toward further urbanization it becomes more	and more homogeneous with the north- a tendency which willard	thorp terms yankeefication as evidenced in such cities as charlotte	birmingham and houston.	3.0289667428556335
17974. it is said that even at the present	stage of southern urbanization such a city as atlanta is not distinctly	unlike columbus or trenton.	5.43815600635797
17975. undoubtedly even the old southern	stalwart richmond has felt the new wind: william styron mentions	in his latest novel an avenue named for bankhead mcgruder a civil	war general now renamed in typical california fashion buena	vista terrace.	3.003408622463321
17976. the effects of television and other mass media	are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force.	4.821730958734537
17977. as for progress the backward south can boast of baton rouge	which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred	and sixty-two percent to 126000 the second largest growth of the period	for all cities over 25000.	3.2413110859556884
17978. the field then is ripe for	new southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century	phenomenon the southern yankeefication: the new urban economy	the city-dweller the pains of transition the labor problems; the	list is obviously endless.	4.320270058975883
17979. but these sources have not been tapped.	5.664130856325598
17980. truman capote is still reveling in southern gothicism exaggerating	the old southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque but	as unreal as- or even more unreal than- yesterday.	4.569200245007846
17981. william	styron while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance	insists he is not to be classified as a southern writer and	yet includes traditional southern concepts in everything he publishes.	3.707209099063298
17982. even the great god faulkner the south's one probable contender	for literary immortality has little concerned himself with these matters;	such are simply not within his bounded province.	4.982513276091697
17983. where	are the writers to treat these changes?	4.2937047264910095
17984.  has the agrarian tradition	become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded	or unwanted?	5.396854101944647
17985.  perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the	older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated	testings over the decades.	3.4978706404436566
17986. lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to	write of a new economy these writers seem to be contenting themselves	with an old one that is now as defunct as confederate money.	5.458657260511296
17987. an example of the changes which have crept over the southern region	may be seen in the southern negro's quest for a position in	the white-dominated society a problem that has been reflected in regional	fiction especially since 1865.	3.71646674347898
17988. today the negro must discover his	role in an industrialized south which indicates that the racial	aspect of the southern dilemma hasn't changed radically but rather	has gradually come to be reflected in this new context this new coat	of paint.	4.916562145613601
17989. the negro faces as much if not more difficulty in fitting	himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one.	3.251476102371028
17990. this	represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem.	5.884491284828207
17991. but there	have been abrupt changes as well: the sit-ins the picket lines	the bus strikes- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago.	3.4014176767575073
17992. today's evidence such as the fact that only three southern states	still openly defy integration	would have astounded many of yesterday's southerners into speechlessness.	5.500203121518617
17993. other examples of gradual changes that have	affected the negro have been his moving up row by row in the busses;	his requesting and often getting higher wages better working conditions	better schools- changes that were slowly emerging even before	the supreme court decision of 1954.	3.044465089117617
17994. then came this decision which	sped the process of gaining equality	: an abrupt change.	6.374404105746723
17995. since 1954 the negro's desire for social justice has led	to an ironically anarchical rebellion.	3.7180863013117986
17996. he has frequently refused to move	from white lunch counters refused to obey local laws which he	considers unjust while in other cases he has appealed to federal	laws.	5.277625652286394
17997. this bold self-assertion after decades of humble subservience	is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon an abrupt change in the southern	way of existence.	3.3856410415489493
17998. a new order is thrusting itself into being.	6.531832464526677
17999. a new south is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation	uncertainty and lack of action from the negro in defining his new role	in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white	man.	3.307646048463987
18000. the modern negro has not made a decisive debut into southern	fiction.	5.559996161997886
18001. it is clear that while most writers enjoy picturing	the negro as a woolly-headed humble old agrarian who mutters yassuhs	and sho' nufs with blissful deference to his white employer	this stereotype is doomed	to become in reality as obsolete as caldwell's lester.	2.9615827939446646
18002. while	there may still be many faulknerian lucas beauchamps scattered through	the rural south such men appear to be a vanishing breed.	5.492515457380759
18003. writers	openly admit that the negro is easier to write than the white man;	but they obviously mean by this not a negro personality but a negro	type.	3.715098628287339
18004. presenting an individualized negro character it would	seem is one of the most difficult assignments a southern writer could	tackle; and the success of such an endeavor is as suggested above	glaringly rare.	5.660719231552081
18005. just as the negro situation points up the	gradual and abrupt changes affecting southern life it also points up	the non-representation of urbanism in southern literature.	3.522553494862204
18006. the book	concerned with the negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed;	recently only keith wheeler's novel peaceable lane has	openly faced the problem.	4.304945064643029
18007. all but the most rabid of confederate	flag wavers admit that the old southern tradition is defunct in	actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance	of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid	ante-bellum way of life.	3.2371748200501136
18008. many earlier writers mourning the demise	of the old order tended to romanticize and exaggerate this gracious	old south imagery creating such lasting impressions as margaret	mitchell's	tara plantation.	4.592578780452214
18009. modern writers who are supposed	to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects insist	upon drawing out this legend prolonging its burial when it well deserves	a rest after the overexploitation of the past century.	3.2784118771303135
18010. perhaps	these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing; but	they can hardly deny that exaggerated or not the old panorama is dead.	4.991881332157965
18011. as john t westbrook says in his article twilight of southern	regionalism: h	the miasmal mausoleum where an old south already too minutely	autopsied in prose and poetry should be left to rest in peace forever	dead and forever done with.	3.087453269540853
18012. westbrook	further bemoans the southern writers' creation of an unreal image	of their homeland which is too readily assimilated by both foreign	readers and visiting yankees: our northerner is suspicious of	all this crass evidence of urbanization presented to his senses.	4.376008647514368
18013. it bewilders and befuddles him.	5.244718543038473
18014. he is too deeply steeped in william	faulkner and robert penn warren.	6.673170607686248
18015. the fumes of progress are in his	nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes but his	heart is away in yoknapatawpha county with razorback hogs and night	riders.	2.929395800787686
18016. on this trip to the south he wants above all else to sniff	the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at	least one barn burn at midnight.	5.83438298562292
18017. obviously such a northern tourist's	purpose is somewhat akin to a child's experience with disneyland:	he wants to see a world of make-believe.	3.8143410349520637
18018. in the	meantime while the south has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization	that is so disappointing to the curious yankee southern writers	have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's	progress.	4.761764490028814
18019. willard thorp in his new book american writing in	the twentieth century observes quite validly it seems: h	certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched.	3.1219369407667084
18020. no southern novelist has done for atlanta or birmingham what	herrick dreiser and farrell did for chicago or dos passos did	for new york h there are almost no fictional treatments of the	industrialized south.	4.6282748361806485
18021. not a single southern author major or minor	has made the urban problems of an urban south his primary source material.	3.8377271567769524
18022. faulkner for one appears to be safe from the accusing	fingers of all assailants in this regard.	5.883578973689178
18023. faulkner culminates the	southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been or could	ever be done.	3.7391918700211266
18024. he has made it his and his it remains irrevocably.	7.700850271056314
18025. he treats it with a mythological universal application.	4.720759724214975
18026. as	his disciples boast even though his emphasis is elsewhere faulkner	does show his awareness of the changing order of the south quite keenly	as can be proven by a quick recalling of his sartoris and snopes	families.	5.1850803433614505
18027. even two decades ago in go down moses faulkner	was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through	its youth and its new way of life the south might be reborn and the	curse of slavery erased from its soil.	3.3936924066012955
18028. yet his concern even here is	with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general and he never	deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial	impact.	4.863862455206386
18029. faulkner traces in his vast and overpowering saga	of yoknapatawpha county the gradual changes which seep into the	south building layer upon layer of minute subtle innovation which eventually	tend largely to hide the old way.	2.9938145686277564
18030. thus faulkner reminds	us and wisely that the new south has gradually evolved out of	the old south and consequently its agrarian roots persist.	5.584372074685805
18031. yet he	presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers	if not himself: the problems with which a new south must grapple	in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization.	3.3157987908256885
18032. with new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of	six men: a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil.	5.243049195141047
18033. the	thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with	even greater stress and tension: the sacred wilderness is gradually	surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas.	2.96827978274734
18034. another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual	devices of the theatre.	6.57636660463383
18035. most avant-garde creators true to their	interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement have tended to dress	their dancers in simple lines and solid colors and to	give them a bare cyclorama for a setting.	3.1191170813234486
18036. but robert rauschenberg	the neo-dadaist artist has collaborated with several of them.	5.742622837426004
18037. he has	designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white	for mr cunningham's summerspace so that dancers and background	merge into a shimmering unity.	3.124756671235126
18038. for mr taylor's images	and reflections he made some diaphanous tents that alternately	hide and reveal the performer and a girl's cape lined with grass.	4.9609153294634165
18039. mr	nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume	and decor.	4.395447826772604
18040. in fact he calls his productions dance-theatre works	of motion shape light and sound.	6.081571510359513
18041. to raise the dancer out of his personal	pedestrian self mr nikolais has experimented with relating	him to a larger environmental orbit.	3.6082915212559845
18042. he began with masks to make	the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be.	5.737471735058515
18043. he	went on to use objects- hoops poles capes- which he employed as	extensions of the body of the dancer who moved with them.	3.8925617350496657
18044. the depersonalization	continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play	of lights upon his figure.	4.837015914406814
18045. in each case the object the color even	the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become	part of the theatrical being of the performer.	3.560662164240464
18046. the dancer who never	loosens her hold on a parasol begins to feel that it is part of herself.	6.1724858322683644
18047. or clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of	hoops the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a finial.	3.711071434939194
18048. as the dancer is depersonalized his accouterments are animized	and the combined elements give birth to a new being.	6.002172114269094
18049. from this being	come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single	unit.	3.9620519171791377
18050. thus the avant-garde choreographers have extended the	scope of materials available for dance composition.	6.072511121954195
18051. but since they	have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity how are they	to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal?	3.384130126359925
18052.  some	look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply	corresponding methods to their own work.	5.664304977322563
18053. others less consciously	but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times experiment	with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet painter	and musician.	3.864266725998415
18054. an approach that has appealed to some choreographers	is reminiscent of charles olson's statement of the process	of projective verse: one perception must immediately and directly	lead to a further perception.	4.933554743427254
18055. the creator trusts his intuition to	lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors	the reality of his experience.	3.0475296678512453
18056. he disdains external restrictions- conventional	syntax traditional metre.	5.9843476783859115
18057. the unit of form is determined	subjectively: the heart by the way of the breath to the line.	4.414113169838249
18058. the test of form is fidelity to the experience a gauge also accepted	by the abstract expressionist painters.	5.1764633928438
18059. an earlier but	still influential school of painting surrealism had suggested the way	of dealing with the dream experience that event in which seemingly	incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations	of the subconscious.	3.2230930567053573
18060. the resulting picture might appear a maze of	restless confusions and contradictions but it is more true to life than	a portrait of an artificially contrived order.	5.093357467375308
18061. the contemporary painter	tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but	their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines colors masses	and energies.	3.048433453990497
18062. he is still concerned however with a personal event.	7.2803503941551435
18063. he accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence	of the vitality of the experience of creation.	3.879812477930932
18064. the work must	be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience.	6.533704714131928
18065. some painters have less interest in the experience of the	moment with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities than in looking	beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher more serene level	of truth.	3.3952625454352443
18066. rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations	they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design which symbolize	an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world.	4.877054576005413
18067. but in this approach it is the artist's	ultimate insight rather than his immediate impressions that gives	form to the work.	4.308630765096667
18068. others look to more objective devices of	order.	7.353464791198507
18069. the musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes	a mathematical system of rotations that once set in motion	determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities.	3.0730425193708464
18070. the composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of	intervals.	5.421253143580973
18071. he may even alter the pattern	by applying a scheme of random numbers.	4.0215768173623
18072. but he cannot order his	elements by will either rational or inspired.	6.222274338985384
18073. the system works as an	impersonal mechanism.	4.247355045553717
18074. musicians who use the chance method also exclude	subjective control of formal development.	5.8019537079221
18075. again the composer must	select his own materials.	5.105564098027301
18076. but a tossing of coins with perhaps the added	safeguard of reference to the oracles of the i ching the chinese	book of changes dictates the handling of the chosen materials.	4.987688348559453
18077. avant-garde choreographers seeking new forms of continuity	for their new vocabulary of movements have turned to similar approaches.	3.3374555734496782
18078. some let dances take their form from the experience of creation.	6.558599366365531
18079. according to katherine litz the becoming the process of realization	is the dance.	4.344682761960317
18080. the process stipulates that the choreographer	sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that	he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it.	5.417202427747859
18081. the sequence	may involve a sharp contrast: for example a quiet meditative sway	of the body succeeded by a violent leap; or it may involve more subtle	distinctions: the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged	its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified or it may be transferred	to become a movement of only the arms or the head.	3.040211124511265
18082. even the least	alteration will change the quality.	7.659419516780714
18083. an exploration of these possible	relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form	to the dance.	3.933958859793495
18084. the approach to the depiction of the experience	of creation may be analytic as it is for miss litz or spontaneous	as it is for merle marsicano.	5.616811547174385
18085. she too is concerned with the	becoming the process of realization but she does not think in	terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns.	3.7475994770750902
18086. the design	is determined emotionally: i must reach into myself for the spring	that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event	with which the dance confronts me.	4.311851396560763
18087. looking back miss marsicano	feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of jackson pollock.	4.024641440044582
18088. at one time she felt impelled to make dances that moved all	over the stage much as pollock's paintings move violently over	the full extent of the canvas.	5.319572273925295
18089. but her conscious need was to break away	from constricting patterns of form a need to let the experience shape	itself.	3.955214903518018
18090. midi garth also believes in subjective continuity	that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement.	5.269866200370428
18091. it	may be a free front-back swing of the leg leading to a sideways swing	of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off	from the ground.	3.3875887496565578
18092. this became a dance called prelude to flight.	6.458720108752571
18093. a pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close	to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus.	3.2980272214343653
18094. alwin nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal	emotion.	5.721876044480785
18095. he seeks to make his dancers more godlike by relating	them to the impersonal elements of shape light color and sound.	3.468222775765815
18096. if	his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures	from mars this is consistent with his intention of placing them in	the orbit of another world a world in which they are freed of their	pedestrian identities.	5.330406192372643
18097. it is through the metamorphosed dancer that the	germ of form is discovered.	4.222923914762407
18098. in his recognition of his impersonal self	the dancer moves and this self in the first revealed stroke of	its existence states the theme from which all else must follow.	5.420464608520059
18099. the	theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve.	4.191055831068344
18100. it may be a reaction to a percussive sound the following movements	constituting further reactions.	6.534103093667801
18101. it may establish the relation of the	figure of the dancer to light and color in which case changes in the	light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs.	3.5939760464471564
18102. unconcerned	with the practical function of his actions the dancer is engrossed	exclusively in their motional content.	5.432396821995714
18103. movements unfold freely	because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive.	3.4186739228990994
18104. but the metamorphosis must come first.	7.294623270062883
18105. though he is also concerned	with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity merce	cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim.	3.494873693079797
18106. he rejects all subjectively motivated continuity any line of action	related to the concept of cause and effect.	5.477098114354536
18107. he bases his approach	on the belief that anything can follow anything.	4.020396597987772
18108. an order can be chanced	rather than chosen and this approach produces an experience that	is free and discovered rather than bound and remembered.	5.010539673691994
18109. thus	there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance	but in the shape of their continuity as well.	4.169806463175751
18110. chance he finds enables	him to create a world beyond imagination.	6.393473302113919
18111. he cites with pleasure	the comment of a lady who exclaimed after a concert: why	it's extremely interesting.	3.3698007692595113
18112. but i would never have thought of it myself.	8.212311289756453
18113. the sequence of movements in a cunningham dance is	unlike any sequence to be seen in life.	3.870736931090866
18114. at one side of the stage a dancer	jumps excitedly; nearby another sits motionless while still another	is twirling an umbrella.	6.108223005751381
18115. a man and a girl happen to meet; they	look straight at the audience not at each other.	4.220321310771576
18116. he lifts her puts	her down and walks off neither pleased nor disturbed as if nothing	had happened.	4.994277918409196
18117. if one dancer slaps another the victim may do a pirouette	sit down or offer his assailant a fork and spoon.	3.5391848634819243
18118. events occur	without apparent reason.	7.300891943240865
18119. their consequences are irrelevant- or there	are no consequences at all.	3.9455729793469816
18120. the sequence is determined by	chance and mr cunningham makes use of any one of several chance	devices.	5.835895465200747
18121. he may toss coins; he may take slips of paper from a grab	bag.	4.035451179124852
18122. the answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal	organization of the dance but also its spatial design special	slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be	performed.	5.05208865009737
18123. the other variables include the dancer who is to perform	the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance.	4.504044898769819
18124. the only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the	movements themselves the number of the dancers and the approximate	total duration of the dance.	5.571002079433002
18125. the approximate is important because	even after the order of the work has been established by the chance	method the result is not inviolable.	3.946458468631103
18126. each performance may be different.	8.311514176279342
18127. if a work is divided into several large segments a last-minute	drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for	any particular performance.	3.798384506563834
18128. and any sequence can not only change its	positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether.	5.849476947556571
18129. mr cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method; he	adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can.	3.564697131298088
18130. however there is always	the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible	to execute.	5.766520894730374
18131. then the choreographer must arbitrate.	5.926192936605399
18132. he must	rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other.	5.51806139423491
18133. he must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone	one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation	for the leap.	3.611575109551835
18134. the north and the south were in greater agreement on sovereignty	through all their dispute about it than were the founding fathers.	5.539274738919639
18135. the truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen	of the calibre of webster and calhoun and defended in the end	by leaders of the nobility of lincoln and lee.	3.05922689927841
18136. the people everywhere	had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles in	understanding of and belief in the federal balance and in love of their	union.	5.266653701289339
18137. repeated efforts- beginning with the missouri compromise	of 1821- were made by such master moderates as clay and douglas	to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise rather than clear	thought and timely action.	3.135700387505124
18138. even so confusion in this period gained	such strength that it led to the	bloodiest war of the nineteenth century.	6.3844994491695815
18139. nothing can show more than	this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in	even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty.	3.351162769512348
18140. the present issue in atlantica- whether to transform an	alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens-	resembles the american one of 1787-89 rather than the one that	was resolved by civil war.	4.902917619835226
18141. and so i would only touch upon it now	.	5.099146322340697
18142. i think it is	essential however to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts	of sovereignty that went to war in 1861- if only to see better	how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse	confusion on this subject.	5.2503273922439035
18143. the difference came down to this:	the southern states insisted that the united states was in last	analysis what its name implied- a union of states.	3.865735171016854
18144. to their leaders	the constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign	states who therefore retained the right to secede from it.	6.572045194731406
18145. this right	of the state its upholders contended was essential to maintain	the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger	of centralizing power in the union government.	3.675710896160517
18146. the champions of	the union maintained that the constitution had formed fundamentally	the united people of america that it was a compact among sovereign	citizens rather than states and that therefore the states had no right	to secede though the citizens could.	5.084803960333084
18147. writing to speed on august	24 1855 lincoln made the latter point clear.	3.9105002416996015
18148. in homely terms whose	timeliness is startling today he thus declared his own right to secede.	5.5337728991629636
18149. we began by declaring that all men are created equal.	4.597478760182077
18150. we now practically read it all men are created equal except negroes.	6.662306150635221
18151. when the know-nothings get control it will read all	men	are created equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics.	3.6403395674218118
18152. when	it comes to this i shall prefer emigrating to some country where	they make no pretence of loving liberty- to russia for instance where	despotism can be taken pure without the base alloy of hypocrisy.	4.814565214271243
18153. his emphasis   when the southern states exercised	their right to secede they formed what they officially styled the	confederate states of america.	3.6978939817885768
18154. dictionaries as we have	seen still cite this government along with the articles of confederation	of 1781 as an example of a confederacy.	5.626227942847841
18155. the fact is that the	southern confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as	the federal constitution did.	3.839071536046881
18156. the confederate constitution copied	much of the federal constitution verbatim and most of the rest in	substance.	6.167710935542469
18157. it operated on by and for the people individually just as	did the federal constitution.	4.597076900001569
18158. it made substantially the same division	of power between the central and state governments and among the	executive legislative and judicial branches.	5.448224054239432
18159. confederacy and federal union in 1861	many believe- and understandably-	that the great difference between the constitution of	the southern confederacy and the federal constitution was that the	former recognized the right of each state to secede.	3.6114844111243563
18160. but though each	of its members had asserted this right against the union the final	constitution which the confederacy signed on march 11- nearly a month	before hostilities began- included no explicit provision authorizing	a state to secede.	4.661926303639716
18161. its drafters discussed this vital point but	left it out of their constitution.	4.368585021216489
18162. their president jefferson davis	interpreted their constitution to mean that it admits of no coerced	association but this reremained so doubtful that there were	frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the constitution.	5.261661547706664
18163. the constitution of the southern confederation	differed from that of the federal union only in two important respects:	it openly defiantly recognized slavery- an institution	which the southerners of 1787 even though they continued it found so	impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning	the word in the federal constitution.	3.3220653997497784
18164. they recognized that	slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest and that	to recognize it explicitly in their constitution would be in explosive	contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in	the declaration of 1776 that all men are created equal that they	are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among	them are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness h.	4.848731027237906
18165. the	other important difference between the two constitutions was that the	president of the confederacy held office for six	years and was limited to one term.	3.8461583257529908
18166. these are not however differences	in federal structure.	7.64836391534457
18167. the only important differences from that	standpoint between the two constitutions lies in their preambles.	3.967922585588109
18168. the one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people	were acting through their states whereas the preamble of 1787-89	expressed as clearly as language can the opposite concept that they	federal	constitution 1789	in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure	domestic tranquility provide for the common defence promote the general	welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and	our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united	states of america.	4.450639852066601
18169. we	the people of the confederate states each state acting in its	sovereign and independent character in order to form a permanent federal	government establish justice insure domestic tranquility and secure	the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity- invoking	the favor and the guidance of almighty god- do ordain and establish	this constitution for the confederate states of america.	3.2530607643980893
18170. one is tempted to say that on the difference between the concepts	of sovereignty in these two preambles the worst war of the nineteenth	century was fought.	6.371903596058135
18171. but though the southern states when drafting	a constitution to unite themselves narrowed the difference to this	fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede the fact remained	that by seceding from the union they had already acted on the concept	that it was composed primarily of sovereign states.	3.3615803296824915
18172. if the union	conceded this to them the same right must be conceded to each remaining	state whenever it saw fit to secede: this would destroy the federal	balance between it and the states and in the end sacrifice to	the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained	by their union.	5.3763239550307995
18173. lincoln saw that the act of secession made the	issue for the union a vital one: whether it was a union of sovereign	citizens that should continue to live or an association of sovereign	states that must fall prey either to anarchy or despotism.	3.4882920114698996
18174. much as he abhorred slavery lincoln was always willing to	concede to each slave state the right to decide independently whether	to continue or end it.	5.556742453942483
18175. though his election was interpreted by	many southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal	balance in favor of the union lincoln himself proposed no such change	in the rights the constitution gave the states.	3.5286042742682047
18176. after the war began	he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by union action	even in the border states that stayed with the union.	5.762361555011181
18177. he issued	his emancipation proclamation only when he felt that necessity left	him no other way to save the union.	3.775790255973594
18178. in his message of december	2 1862 he put his purpose and his policy in these words- which i	would call the lincoln law of liberty-and-union: in giving	freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free.	4.832067383848718
18179. what	lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people	were sovereign in the union.	3.929374957981665
18180. he fought to the end to preserve it	as a government of the people by the people for the people.	7.401039590163425
18181. truth on each side won in the civil war	the fact that the americans	who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to	keep many of their people more securely in slavery- the antithesis	of individual liberty- made the conflict grimmer and the greater.	3.4977878388092134
18182. out of this ordeal the citizen emerged in the south as in the north	as america's true sovereign in a new birth of freedom as	lincoln promised.	6.163114688450393
18183. but before this came about 214938 americans had	given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights	of men and of states.	3.691712781784806
18184. on their decisive battlefield lincoln	did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the brave	men living and dead who fought here.	5.501104270055603
18185. he understood that both	sides were at fault and he reached the height of saying so explicitly	in his second inaugural.	3.6062353343225113
18186. to my knowledge lincoln remains	the only head of state and commander-in-chief who while fighting	a fearful war whose issue was in doubt proved man enough to say this	publicly- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human	truth there is some error and in all our error some truth.	5.107339455978895
18187. so great	a man could not but understand too that the thing that moves men to	sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought which their	opponents see and attack but the truth which the latter do not see-	any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves	defend.	3.511707459407341
18188. it is much less difficult now than in lincoln's day	to see that on both sides sovereign americans had given their lives	in the civil war to maintain the balance between the powers they had	delegated to the states and to their union.	5.417597356707731
18189. they differed in the	balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen-	but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental	truth: that individual life liberty and happiness depend	on a right balance between the two- and on the limitation of sovereignty	in all its aspects which this involves.	3.3530557568000052
18190. the 140414 americans	who gave the last full measure of devotion to prevent disunion	preserved individual freedom in the united states from the dangers	of anarchy inherent in confederations which throughout history have	proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign	states and to the liberties of their people.	5.071197047636621
18191. but the fact that	70524 other americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing	concept served liberty-and-union in other essential ways.	3.7411311582775713
18192. its appeal from ballots to bullets at fort sumter ended by costing	the southerners their right to have slaves- a right that was even	less compatible with the sovereignty of man.	4.96556065406471
18193. the very fact that they	came so near to winning by the wrong method war led directly to their	losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for since it forced	lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure.	3.240008461201459
18194. there was	a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another.	6.5923506642462115
18195. there was also a	lesson one that has served ever since to keep americans in their conflicts	with one another from turning from the ballot to the bullet.	3.72223990647478
18196. yet though the southern states lost the worst errors in their case	they did not lose the truth they fought for.	5.930232599204268
18197. the lives so many of them	gave to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment	by the union on the powers reserved to their states have continued	ever since to safeguard all americans against freedom's other foe.	3.1965718667119094
18198. as cells coalesced into organisms they built new unnatural and	internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with	the entropy-increasing properties of the external world.	4.884396705140762
18199. the useful	suggestion of professor david hawkins which considers culture as a	third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with	our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique	for building protective artificial environments.	2.825979634850126
18200. one wonders	about its applicability to people.	7.065224107827207
18201. will advances in human sciences help	us build social structures and governments which will enable us to	cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein	and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to	adapt to a sea of molecular interaction?	3.09787649565321
18202.  the answer is of course yes.	7.882768110365441
18203. for the family is the simplest example of just such a unit composed	of people which gives us both some immunity from and a way of dealing	with other people.	3.8417124851515894
18204. social invention did not have to await social	theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await lavoisier	or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of archimedes.	5.837803377834094
18205. but it has been during the last two centuries during the scientific	revolution that our independence from the physical environment has	made the most rapid strides.	4.124310298678302
18206. we have ample light when the sun sets;	the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons; we fly	through the air although gravity pulls us down; the range of our	voice ignores distance.	4.783391514387492
18207. at what stage are social sciences then?	4.887689276039885
18208.  is	the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time	of newton?	5.822604984526572
18209.  there is a haunting resemblance between the notion	of cause in copernicus and in freud.	4.0015042414352955
18210. and it is certainly no slight	to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact.	6.605753438872429
18211. political theoretical understanding although almost at a standstill	during this century did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth	centuries and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased	the possibility for man to coexist with man.	3.1973871495293626
18212. consitutional government	popular vote trial by jury public education labor unions cooperatives	communes socialized ownership world courts and the veto	power in world councils are but a few examples.	4.635575899081221
18213. most of these with	horrible exceptions were conceived as is a ship not as an attempt to	quell the ocean of mankind nor to deny its force but as a means to	survive and enjoy it.	3.710115966083626
18214. the most effective political inventions seem to	make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters	can play only a minor part in the whole scheme.	5.433531719191077
18215. just as present	technology had to await the explanations of physics so one might	expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding.	3.5876193918320305
18216. we are desperately in the need of such invention for man is	still very much at the mercy of man.	6.088046004927883
18217. in fact the accumulation of the	hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other.	3.8228093988735874
18218. i want therefore to discuss a second and quite different	fruit of science the connection between scientific understanding	and fear.	5.564674817842313
18219. there are certainly large areas of understanding in the human	sciences which in themselves and even without political invention	can help to dispel our present fears.	3.4646679122240487
18220. lucretius has remarked: the	reason why all mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all	sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause	and these they attribute to the will of god.	5.088873610432421
18221. perhaps things	were even worse then.	5.472578634900257
18222. it is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears	of man.	6.610581532269285
18223. we get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and	from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people	now than man ever was.	3.5974864888625318
18224. we are not now afraid of atomic bombs in	the same way that people once feared comets.	6.3971054522022195
18225. the bombs are as harmless	as an automobile in a garage.	3.7035893036419174
18226. we are worried about what people may	do with them- that some crazy fool may push the button.	5.553692742115306
18227. i am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human	fears but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific	explanations that stand out quite clearly.	3.6003519834256386
18228. they are in general	those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual.	6.7794064968690515
18229. they include both individual fears and collective ones.	4.477959089603438
18230. they arise	in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not	only on the external world but also on the precise pattern of behavior	of the individual or group.	5.296955912817293
18231. often it is recognized that all the details	of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but because	the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical	understanding one is never quite certain which behavior elements	are effective and the whole pattern becomes ritualized.	3.553277410432529
18232. yet often	fear persists because even with the most rigid ritual one is never	quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or	that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive	act.	5.177297008257076
18233. to say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates	the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much	of magic and superstition.	3.626570305317017
18234. but a somewhat more detailed analysis	of this process may be illuminating.	6.574933648530781
18235. the frequently postulated	antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness	apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize.	3.1324339160258896
18236. it is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly	cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people	to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice.	5.068277147213103
18237. this and other	fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually first with the	ptolemaic	system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then more	firmly with the newtonian innovation of an universal force that could	account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions.	2.9716365817317807
18238. this understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one	can eliminate fear without instituting any controls.	5.992305274871968
18239. in fact although	we have dispelled the fear we have not necessarily assured ourselves	that there are no dangers.	4.190755507344755
18240. there is still the remote possibility	of planetoid collision.	7.765227605993978
18241. a meteor could fall on san francisco.	4.040033753895837
18242. solar	activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought.	5.58066721482832
18243. our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our	former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which in this case	amounts to doing nothing.	3.6519838771320265
18244. yet we no longer feel uneasy.	8.403930160433967
18245. this almost	trivial example is nevertheless suggestive for there are some elements	in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter	and shorter and our present fear of war.	3.353992889240185
18246. we in our country think	of war as an external threat which if it occurs will not be primarily	of our own doing.	5.844867556253277
18247. and yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance	of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way	on the details of how we behave.	3.818021874319756
18248. what elements of our behavior are decisive?	7.500905907602768
18249. 	our weapons production our world prestige our ideas of democracy	our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage?	3.1332812496379625
18250. 	we have staved off a war and since our behavior has involved all	these elements we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring	to abandon any part of it since we have not the slightest notion which	parts are effective.	4.93329781507333
18251. i think that we are here also talking of	the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching	at night along the streets of a large city.	4.222772073609608
18252. if an automobile	were approaching him he would know what was required of him even though	he might not be able to act quickly enough.	6.274348702527937
18253. with the group of boys	it is different.	5.415924642982862
18254. he does not know whether to look up or look aside	to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side to cross	the street or to continue on the same side.	5.406166115697876
18255. when confronted with	a drunk or an insane person i have no notion of what any one of them	might do to me or to himself or to others.	3.7550919645748677
18256. i believe that what i do	has some effect on his actions and i have learned in a way to commune	with drunks but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly	the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment	in physics.	5.366877074627078
18257. i am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some	unwitting slip all hell may break loose.	3.753405172433667
18258. our inability to explain	why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of	ritual and malaise.	5.191798954170842
18259. we are forced in our behavior towards others to	adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a	minimal understanding of their essential elements.	3.638275047471607
18260. our collective	policies group and national are similarly based on voodoo but	here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still	engaged in determing them.	4.688821099158025
18261. we use terms from our personal experience	with individuals such as trust cheat and get tough.	3.7697527623319433
18262. we talk about national character in the same way that copernicus	talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles.	5.9627773826176975
18263. we	perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually	no understanding of social cause and effect.	3.462111329721934
18264. small wonder then	that we fear.	7.51956380456269
18265. the achievements which dispelled our fears of	the cosmos took place three centuries ago.	3.187956530797143
18266. what additional roles has	the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played?	6.191537319212232
18267. 	in the physical sciences these achievements concern electricity chemistry	and atomic physics.	3.404302767652644
18268. in the life sciences there has been an	enormous increase in our understanding of disease in the mechanisms of	heredity and in bio- and physiological chemistry.	5.529814013634547
18269. the major effect	of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the	industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding	has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment.	3.3524836289703317
18270. in	addition our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also	changed.	5.920964748768236
18271. even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding	is still lacking but where some explanations are possible as with	lightning and weather and earthquakes the appropriate kind of human action	has been more adequately indicated.	3.235174764025385
18272. apparently the population	as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations	of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears.	5.1713771870697345
18273. how and	why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject	for study.	3.9900639425123985
18274. in some areas the progress is slower than in others.	7.235267788731546
18275. in	agriculture for example despite the advances in biology elaborate	rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence	of some natural disaster.	3.559695052740184
18276. in child care the opposite extreme prevails;	procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds	anything warranted by established psychological theory.	4.731084055746535
18277. there are	many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite	appropriate reduction in ritual and fear.	3.845797249255756
18278. much of the former extreme	uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death	has disappeared.	6.150084203966235
18279. the persistent horror of having a malformed child	has i believe been reduced not because we have gained any control	over this misfortune but precisely because we have learned that we	have so little control over it.	3.3292913188694007
18280. in fact the recent warnings about the	use of x-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which	now require more detailed understanding and thus in this instance	science has momentarily aggravated our fears.	4.8373885776392385
18281. in fact insofar as	science generates any fear it stems not so much from scientific prowess	and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise	which until they are understood create uncertainty.	3.5202615908976127
18282. perhaps	the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding	is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease.	6.202259814188433
18283. the situation with regard to our attitude and control of disease	contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect	to people.	3.2946339100525113
18284. the fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear	i have tried to describe.	5.880344297261311
18285. nothing like godot he arrived before the hour.	4.523313921268275
18286. his letter had	suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on sunday and i came into	the lobby as the clock struck twelve.	5.081930222211705
18287. my wish	to meet samuel beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest	in his work.	3.5609609917006217
18288. american newspaper reviewers like to call his plays	nihilistic.	6.761179224413981
18289. they find deep pessimism in them.	4.62716052581734
18290. even so astute a commentator	as harold clurman of the nation has said that waiting	for godot is the concentrate h of the contemporary european	h mood of despair.	5.814421825536446
18291. but to me beckett's writing had seemed	permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that	i could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism.	3.676439613008978
18292. could it	be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me?	5.964489749523107
18293.  is his a literature of	defeat irrelevant to the social crises we face?	4.436875151695189
18294.  or is it relevant	because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves?	6.244599367585864
18295. 	i knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such	questions because a man is not the same as his writing: in the last	analysis the questions had to be settled by the work itself.	3.995786011633086
18296. my curiosity was sharpened a day or two	before the interview by a conversation i had with a well-informed teacher	of literature a jesuit father at a conference on religious	drama near paris.	4.83992036355797
18297. when beckett's name came into the discussion	the priest	grew loud and told me that beckett hates life.	3.8094759825151674
18298. that	i thought is at least one thing i can find out when we meet.	7.509139761112527
18299. beckett's appearance is rough-hewn irish.	4.5656778164139595
18300. the features of his face	are distinct but not fine.	5.666502665035175
18301. they look as if they had been sculptured	with an unsharpened chisel.	4.883431494881817
18302. unruly hair goes straight up from his	forehead standing so high that the top falls gently over as if to show	that it really is hair and not bristle.	4.9628452019912785
18303. one might say it combines	the man; own pride and humility.	4.499855301208666
18304. for he has the pride that comes of	self-acceptance and the humility perhaps of the same genesis not to	impose himself upon another.	5.763227693363743
18305. his light blue eyes set deep within the	face are actively and continually looking.	3.548226701079134
18306. he seems by some unconscious	division of labor to have given them that one function and no	other leaving communication to the rest of the face.	5.590432369263228
18307. the mouth frequently	breaks into a disarming smile.	3.6706985437064077
18308. the voice is light in timbre with	a rough edge that corresponds to his visage.	4.877470127424153
18309. the irish accent is	as one would expect combined with slight inflections from the french.	3.2343815428739533
18310. his tweed suit was a baggy gray and green.	5.884439938674049
18311. he wore a brown knit	sports shirt with no tie.	4.193737965341452
18312. we walked down the rue de l'arcade	thence along beside the madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe	opposite that church.	5.526381750482557
18313. the conversation that ensued may have been engrossing	but it could hardly be called world-shattering.	3.932093391515897
18314. for one thing	the world that beckett sees is already shattered.	6.607423744676836
18315. his talk turns to	what he calls the mess or sometimes this buzzing confusion.	3.7895182181760885
18316. i reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our	conversation.	5.882927296681344
18317. what appears here is shorter than what he actually said	but very close to his own words.	4.31344590467972
18318. the confusion is not my	invention.	6.0948928393804955
18319. we cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without	being acutely aware of the confusion.	4.2692644291998265
18320. it is all around us and our	only chance now is to let it in.	6.886583995062713
18321. the only chance of renovation is to	open our eyes and see the mess.	3.9742351512173646
18322. it is not a mess you can make sense of.	8.322115400268032
18323. i suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth	but beckett did not take to the word truth.	5.056567376166208
18324. what is more	true than anything else?	8.010160560691395
18325.  to swim is true and to sink is true.	4.5813191053260764
18326. one is not more true than the other.	8.273506224874856
18327. one cannot speak anymore of being	one must speak only of the mess.	4.131080052767656
18328. when heidegger and sartre speak	of a contrast between being and existence they may be right i don't	know but their language is too philosophical for me.	5.228116608385105
18329. i am not a	philosopher.	6.925342232704151
18330. one can only speak of what is in front of him and that	now is simply the mess.	7.713726994452685
18331. then he began to speak about the tension	in art between the mess and form.	4.410566896002321
18332. until recently art has withstood	the pressure of chaotic things.	6.523452817398568
18333. it has held them at bay.	5.694962656242415
18334. it realized	that to admit them was to jeopardize form.	6.676954055029296
18335. how could the mess	be admitted because it appears to be the very opposite of form and	therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be?	4.2616004973274855
18336. 	but now we can keep it out no longer because we have come into a	time when it invades our experience at every moment.	5.311484392012122
18337. it is there	and it must be allowed in.	5.159753641841285
18338. i granted this might be so but	found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously.	6.459497612989347
18339. and why not?	6.282007883436996
18340.  how i asked could chaos be admitted to	chaos?	7.106592898362634
18341.  would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art?	5.984971353418965
18342. 	if we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form.	5.47416729358117
18343. beckett's	own work is an example.	4.945450966730433
18344. plays more highly formalized than waiting	for godot endgame and krapp's last tape would	be hard to find.	4.839985722833706
18345. what i am saying does not mean that there	will henceforth be no form in art.	4.359004973458356
18346. it only means that there will	be new form and that this form will be of such a type that it admits	the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something	else.	6.131707195522932
18347. the form and the chaos remain separate.	4.527303927372578
18348. the latter is not reduced	to the former.	6.739700481566026
18349. that is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation	because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates.	3.862318935859105
18350. to find a form that accommodates the mess that is the task of	the artist now.	7.332211679415972
18351. yet i responded could not similar things	be said about the art of the past?	4.51878678017526
18352.  is it not characteristic of the	greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify	demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable	way?	5.791654961311266
18353.  what is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting	to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow	themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic	theory?	4.248859769863834
18354.  isn't all art ambiguous?	7.606020969019321
18355.    not this he said	and gestured toward the madeleine.	4.816654496971734
18356. the classical lines of the church	which napoleon thought of as a temple of glory dominated all	the scene where we sat.	4.9865602571734104
18357. the boulevard de la madeleine the boulevard	malesherbes and the rue royale ran to it with graceful flattery	bearing tidings of the age of reason.	3.2195329508937625
18358. this does not allow the mystery to invade us.	7.190591254751852
18359. with classical art	all is settled.	5.328855567274043
18360. but it is different at chartres.	9.339108663681037
18361. there is the unexplainable	and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to	answer.	4.721106726483913
18362. i asked about the battle between life and death in	his plays.	7.280284102114303
18363. didi and gogo hover on the edge of suicide; hamm's	world is death and clov may or may not get out of it to join the living	child outside.	3.7339111691208795
18364. is this life-death question a part of the chaos?	8.58525610498794
18365. 	yes.	7.781497302878112
18366. if life and death did not both present themselves to	us there would be no inscrutability.	6.483308533828708
18367. if there were only darkness all	would be clear.	5.180539356882088
18368. it is because there is not only darkness but also	light that our situation becomes inexplicable.	7.21069496878139
18369. take augustine's doctrine	of grace given and grace withheld: have you pondered the dramatic	qualities in this theology?	3.5285541852872666
18370.  two thieves are crucified with christ	one saved and the other damned.	6.586942549390538
18371. how can we make sense of this	division?	5.873323101558075
18372.  in classical drama such problems do not arise.	6.501308995111612
18373. the destiny	of racine's phedre is sealed from the beginning: she will proceed	into the dark.	3.0324679866035176
18374. as she goes she herself will be illuminated.	7.613248711384725
18375. at	the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end	she has complete illumination but there has been no question but that	she moves toward the dark.	3.9496123899608944
18376. within this notion clarity	is possible but for us who are neither greek nor jansenist there	is not such clarity.	5.531086898892147
18377. the question would also be removed if we believed	in the contrary- total salvation.	3.7250703259241567
18378. but where we have both dark	and light we have also the inexplicable.	6.729278596449859
18379. the key word in my plays is	'perhaps'.	4.248653509369888
18380. given a theological lead i asked what he	thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays.	5.454811628191909
18381. well really there is none at all.	5.345243946500804
18382. i have no religious feeling.	9.584860568913232
18383. once i had a religious emotion.	6.182122030006277
18384. it was at my first communion.	7.939473463400296
18385. my mother was deeply religious.	5.637805404091747
18386. he knelt	down at his bed as long as he could kneel.	6.824612925159643
18387. the	family was protestant but for me it was only irksome and i let it	go.	4.072943566801645
18388. my brother and mother got no value from their religion when they	died.	5.943156217934264
18389. at the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old-school	tie.	4.858987434113681
18390. irish catholicism is not attractive but it is deeper.	7.338494372208521
18391. when	you pass a church on an irish bus all the hands flurry in the sign of	the cross.	3.812426091161405
18392. one day the dogs of ireland will do that too and perhaps	also the pigs.	6.381522699627194
18393. but do the plays deal with the same facets	of experience religion must also deal with?	4.242711188131809
18394.    yes for they	deal with distress.	8.04046322438848
18395. some people object to this in my writing.	5.155012058528316
18396. at a	party an english intellectual- so-called- asked me why i write	always about distress.	5.6562792736394725
18397. as if it were perverse to do so! he wanted	to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home	to give me an unhappy childhood.	3.490859499086106
18398. i told him no that i had had a very	happy childhood.	7.44484243187222
18399. then he thought me more perverse than ever.	4.836702271915814
18400. i left	the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi.	6.968204772872218
18401. on the glass partition	between me and the driver were three signs: one asked for help	for the blind another help for orphans and the third for relief for	the war refugees.	3.3358472168335283
18402. one does not have to look for distress.	9.154374337916506
18403. it is screaming	at you even in the taxis of london.	4.5285539882686
18404. lunch was over	and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris screaming	at us.	6.215365139057517
18405. the personal quality of samuel beckett is similar	to qualities i had found in the plays.	3.5766408885751395
18406. he says nothing that compresses	experience within a closed pattern.	6.724633710909518
18407. perhaps stands in	place of commitment.	5.633210624734254
18408. at the same time he is plainly sympathetic clearly	friendly.	8.115910870074556
18409. if there were only the mess all would be clear; but	there is also compassion.	4.318625534633308
18410. as a christian i know i do not	stand where beckett stands but i do see much of what he sees.	6.2818343269208965
18411. as a	writer on the theater i have paid close attention to the plays.	4.263628880412174
18412. harold	clurman is right to say that waiting for godot is a reflection	of the impasse and disarray	of europe's present politics ethic and common way of life.	5.088365759808067
18413. yet it is not only europe the play refers to.	6.139373888602462
18414. waiting for godot	sells even better in america than in france.	6.266608417101995
18415. the consciousness	it mirrors may have come earlier to europe than to america but it	is the consciousness that most mature societies arrive at when	their successes in technological and economic systematization propel	them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture.	2.9672964697417594
18416. america is now joining europe in this mature phase of development.	6.270440324586021
18417. whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens	as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going	on in the countries of asia and africa and also of course on how long	the cold war remains cold.	3.8423920326257806
18418. even hemingway for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality	in the sun also rises and a farewell to arms never	maintained that sex was all.	5.271967283950505
18419. hemingway's fiction is supported by a	moral backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at	a religious dimension.	3.3514093778013136
18420. and d h lawrence in fantasia of the	unconscious protested vehemently against the overestimation of	the sexual motive.	4.892529120733276
18421. though sex in some form or other enters into all human	activity and it was a good thing that freud emphasized this aspect	of human nature it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of	sex.	3.872468591178594
18422. all is not sex declared lawrence.	7.797433177370005
18423. man is not confined	to one outlet for his vital energy.	4.532459886319364
18424. the creative urge for example	transcends the body and the self.	5.404257383563239
18425. but for the beat generation	all is sex.	5.292865006590844
18426. nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary	aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex.	7.472338466158896
18427. for	the beatnik like the hipster is in opposition to a society that is based	on the repression of the sex instinct.	3.7191699310572774
18428. he has elevated sex- not	eros or libido but pure spontaneous uninhibited sex- to the rank	of the godhead; it is astarte ishtar venus yahwe dionysus	christ the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the	body of the universe.	4.307805032497405
18429. jazz is sex marijuana is a stimulus to sex the	beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse.	3.7207641252430674
18430. lawrence lipton in the holy barbarians stresses that for	the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure; it is a	mystique and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities	of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe	of discourse.	5.258457377970185
18431. the singular uncompromising force of their revolt against	the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in	a public place.	3.0408692713651386
18432. the dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression	of ungratified sexual desire.	5.03704182317253
18433. for this reason too their language	is more forthright and earthy.	4.301167480441768
18434. the beatniks crave a sexual experience	in which their whole being participates.	4.8706113553494275
18435. it is therefore not	surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity	for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy.	3.311334725576259
18436. they withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy	the precepts of legalized propriety.	5.350829171247242
18437. unlike the heroes and flappers	of the lost generation they disdain the art of necking and petting.	3.673263895657717
18438. that is reserved for the squares.	9.07863208403995
18439. if they avoid the use	of the pungent outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo;	it is sacred.	4.451971565678861
18440. as lipton the prophet of the beat generation declares:	in the sexual act the beat are filled with mana the divine	power.	5.559220565921619
18441. this is far from the vulgar leering sexuality of the middle-class	square in heat.	4.423121278236209
18442. this is the holy grail these knights of	the orgasm pursue this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they	respond.	6.022512909783638
18443. if wilhelm reich is the moses who has led them out	of the egypt of sexual slavery dylan thomas is the poet who offers	them the dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence	in liquor marijuana sex and jazz.	3.1025204900058236
18444. in addition they have been converted	to zen buddhism with its glorification of all that is natural	and mysteriously alive the sense that everything in the world	is flowing.	5.949257715173819
18445. thus paradoxically the beat writers resort to religious	metaphors: they are in search of mana the spiritual the numinous	but not anything connected with formal religion.	3.6291019808035054
18446. what they are	after is the beatific vision.	7.475927323924024
18447. and zen buddhism though it is extremely	difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled	helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through	sexual release.	3.5675378592858302
18448. the style of life chosen by the beat generation	the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own	is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience.	5.1601786059002785
18449. jazz is	good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided	sexual effect.	4.181560372004733
18450. jazz is the musical language of sex the vocabulary of	the orgasm; indeed it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz	by freeing the listener of his inhibitions can have therapeutic	value.	5.055199902668098
18451. that is why the argument runs the squares are so fearful of	jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it.	3.733845630418404
18452. instead of giving themselves	spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them they	undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes	for satisfaction.	4.9850667032065585
18453. thus jazz is transmuted into something holy the	sacred road to integration of being.	3.825988986331559
18454. jazz like sex is a mystique.	7.628371414099487
18455. it	is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative	impulse in unfettered man.	4.115022041802796
18456. the mystique of sex combined with	marijuana and jazz is intended to provide a design for living.	5.195682251867733
18457. those	who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free their	instincts put at the service of the imagination.	3.6448889907933313
18458. righteous in their	denunciation of all that makes for death the beat prophets bid all	men become cool cats; let them learn to swing freely to let	go to become authentically themselves and then perhaps civilization	will be saved.	4.617835618478229
18459. the beatnik seceding from a society that is fatally	afflicted with a deathward drive is concerned with his personal salvation	in the living present.	3.3988603668385378
18460. if he is the child of nothingness if he	is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars then he will consult	only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil.	5.570380105381933
18461. he will not	curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that	makes him feel truly and fully alive even if it is only for this brief	moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth.	3.4910711552454026
18462. that is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the	title of the holy barbarians; they will destroy the shrines temples	museums and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the	life they believe in.	6.00128741855542
18463. apart from the categorical imperative they derive	from the metaphysics of the orgasm the only affirmation they are	capable of making is that art is their only refuge.	3.3454369803867836
18464. their writing	born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality reflects	the extremity of their existential alienation.	5.236839181784953
18465. the mind has betrayed	them reason is the foe of life; they will trust only their physical	sensations the wisdom of the body the holy promptings of the unconscious.	3.2905571800174123
18466. with lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate but their	faith in love inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz culminates	in the climax of the orgasm.	5.17137374921709
18467. their work mirrors the mentality	of the psychopath rootless and irresponsible.	3.9087126375478327
18468. their rebellion against	authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt	characteristic of the juvenile delinquent.	5.809752111617797
18469. and the life they	lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive even though	they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit-	writing painting music.	3.745933598780132
18470. they are non-conformists on principle.	8.039764239143608
18471. when	they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth	the rage of repudiation the ecstasy of negation.	3.256027243885432
18472. it is sex that obsesses	them sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed.	6.696163502548966
18473. what	they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can	inspire the muse.	3.6439123323624436
18474. monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful	middle class continue to suffer whereas the beatnik has the courage	to break out of that prison of respectability.	5.065304531288131
18475. one girl describes	her past her succession of broken marriages the abortions she has	had	and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she	must justify her passion.	3.2454842318489683
18476. if it is an honest feeling then why should	she not yield to it?	7.22282334047394
18477.  most often she says it's the	monogamous relationship that is dishonest.	4.258553969886223
18478. there is nothing	holy in wedlock.	8.564204739154986
18479. this girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist	who disapproves of her life.	3.6725211330944956
18480. she finds married life stifling and every	prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous.	5.670866227950346
18481. this confession	serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution:	the craving for sensation for its own sake the need for change	for new experiences.	3.4162271462835654
18482. in the realm of physical sensations	sex reigns supreme.	6.920351655549186
18483. hence the beatniks sustain themselves on	marijuana jazz free swinging poetry exhausting themselves in orgies	of sex; some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and	lose contact with reality.	3.3299282470853733
18484. one beat poet composes a poem lines on	a tijuana john which contains a few happy hints for survival.	5.049355805964215
18485. the new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must	move toward simplicity.	3.9319015626057765
18486. the professed mission of this disaffiliated	generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry	and fiction but what they produce is unfortunately disordered nourished	solely on the hysteria of negation.	5.073890756541231
18487. who are the creative	representatives of this movement?	5.286085691378843
18488.  nymphomaniacs junkies homosexuals	drug addicts lesbians alcoholics the weak the frustrated	the irresolute the despairing the derelicts and outcasts of society.	4.367490696446406
18489. they embrace independent poverty usually with a shack-up partner	who will help support them.	3.6589843278328145
18490. they are full of contempt for the institution	of matrimony.	6.598589480404138
18491. their previous legalized marriages do not count	for they hold the laws of the state null and void.	4.058665820890091
18492. they feel they	are leagued against a hostile persecutory world faced with the concerted	malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings the police.	5.175100290930548
18493. this is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending	their way of life their search for wholeness though their actual existence	fails to reach these religious heights.	3.606642326094286
18494. one beatnik got	the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and	all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up.	5.338389424886417
18495. what	obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk?	3.73451773017261
18496.  sex	as the creative principle of the universe the secret of primitive religion	the life of myth.	6.076678133588175
18497. everything in the final analysis reduced itself	to sexual symbolism.	5.081268372428426
18498. in his chapter on the loveways of the	beat generation lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details.	5.636823130171634
18499. no one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in west	venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the	group.	4.001130509523492
18500. the women who come to west venice having forsaken radicalism	are interested in living only for the moment in being constantly	on the move.	5.151397751331983
18501. others who are attracted to this mecca of the beat	generation are homosexuals heroin addicts and smalltime hoodlums.	3.556239820423923
18502. those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks.	6.98905916162298
18503. since the homosexuals widely use marijuana they do not have to be	initiated.	5.367328146736974
18504. part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana.	8.289375612588296
18505. as lipton	puts it: the eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana	with far greater force as a unifying principle in human relationships	than at any other time except perhaps in the mutual metaphysical	orgasms.	3.2398001712551214
18506. the magic circle is in fact a symbol of and preparation for	the metaphysical orgasm.	5.847154474803475
18507. under the influence of marijuana the beatnik	comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense	of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being.	3.727025625644202
18508. carried high on this charge he composes magical poetry	that captures the organic rhythms of life in words.	5.355965270915848
18509. if he thus achieves	a lyrical dreamlike drugged intensity he pays the price for his	indulgence by producing work- allen ginsberg's howl is	a striking example of this tendency- that is disoriented dionysian	but without depth and without apollonian control.	3.1314104780635863
18510. for drugs are in	themselves no royal road to creativity.	6.072942665909574
18511. how is the beat poet to achieve	unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic	derangement of senses.	4.584533568137523
18512. if love reflects the nature of man as	ortega y gasset believes if the person in love betrays decisively what	he is by his behavior in love then the writers of the beat generation	are creating a new literary genre.	5.1768957030498886
18513. there were fences in the old days when we were children.	5.2646694529024725
18514. across	the front of a yard and down the side they were iron either spiked	along the top or arched in half circles.	5.568548274237441
18515. alley fences were made	of solid boards higher than one's head but not so high as the golden	glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them.	3.409621786467688
18516. side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses; front	fences were covered with virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle.	4.496598136137555
18517. square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of	cast-iron foliage; they were topped by steeples complete in every detail:	high-pitched roof pinnacle and narrow gable.	2.9792677688100033
18518. on these posts	the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang.	5.873199310979992
18519. the only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences	was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree.	3.3047037253055787
18520. the primary	quality of that view seems now to have been its quietness but that	cannot at the time have impressed us.	5.440404542287896
18521. what one actually remembers	is its greenness.	5.03175321162846
18522. from high in the tree the whole block lay within	range of the eye but the ground was almost nowhere visible.	5.797983015898611
18523. one looked	down on a sea of leaves a breaking wave of flower.	4.252168212619056
18524. every path from	back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor and every yard had its	fruit trees.	5.243649450199899
18525. in the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers	had planted syringa and sweet-shrub snowball rose-of-sharon and	balm-of-gilead.	3.674052957622176
18526. from above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse	of life on the floor of this green sea: a neighbor's gingham	skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor	or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter	of garments hung there half-way down the block.	4.675250419739923
18527. that was one	epoch: the apple-tree epoch.	5.342254962087768
18528. another had ended before it began.	7.4722569155948
18529. time	is a queer thing and memory a queerer; the tricks that time plays	with memory and memory with time are queerest of all.	3.1205790513379466
18530. from maturity	one looks back at the succession of years counts them and makes them	many yet cannot feel length in the number however large.	5.41130709352695
18531. in a	stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water; the mill-pond	is quiet its surface dark and shadowed and there does not seem to	be much water in it.	3.5463164180945395
18532. time in the sum is nothing.	9.819492602926507
18533. and yet- a year to	a child is an eternity and in the memory that phase of one's being-	a certain mental landscape- will seem to have endured without beginning	and without end.	3.610514196452275
18534. the part of the mind that preserves dates and	events may remonstrate it could have been like that for only a	little while; but true memory does not count nor add: it holds	fast to things that were and they are outside of time.	5.147724597327411
18535. once	then- for how many years or how few does not matter- my world was	bound round by fences when i was too small to reach the apple tree bough	to twist my knee over it and pull myself up.	3.2398613463863994
18536. that world was in	scale with my own smallness.	7.027770864196731
18537. i have no picture in my mind of the garden	as a whole- that i could not see- but certain aspects of certain	corners linger in the memory: wind-blown frost-bitten white chrysanthemums	beneath a window with their brittle brown leaves and their	sharp scent of november; ripe pears lying in long grass to be turned	over by a dusty-slippered foot cautiously lest bees still worked	in the ragged brown-edged holes; hot-colored verbenas in the corner	between the dining-room wall and the side porch where we passed on	our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother	for our childish pleasure in drinking from it.	2.967302228618547
18538. it was	mother who planted the verbenas.	7.425154838193828
18539. i think that my grandmother was not	an impassioned gardener: she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and	grandchildren.	3.8512298580421795
18540. my great-grandmother i have been told made her garden	her great pride; she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders	in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to	be wintered in the cellar; she filled the waste spots of the yard with	common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed	and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house.	4.602971258763583
18541. these my	grandmother left in their places	and planted others like	them that flourished without careful tending.	3.518543656221003
18542. three of these only	were protected from us by stern commandment: the roses whose petals	might not be collected until they had fallen to be made into perfume	or rose-tea to drink; the peonies whose tight sticky buds would	be blighted by the laying on of a finger although they were not apparently	harmed by the ants that crawled over them; and the poppies.	4.591847685418613
18543. i	have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer	morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than	my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap unfolded and shook out	like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals.	2.9047125826123144
18544. other flowers	we might gather as we pleased: myrtle and white violets from beneath	the lilacs; the lilacs themselves that bloomed so prodigally but	for the most part beyond our reach; snowballs; hollyhock blossoms	that	turned upside down make pink-petticoated ladies; and the little	dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere.	4.230680222455225
18545. more	potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a	few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae	which are of the very stuff of the mind intrinsic because they	were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that	held them.	3.6584434086631967
18546. flowers stones and small creatures living and dead.	6.117182625690627
18547. pale	yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite; seed-pods	of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch; red-and-yellow	columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and	eaten	for the honey in them; morning-glory buds which could be so grasped	and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag; bright flowers	from the trumpet vine that made gloves on the ends of ten	waggling fingers.	2.821827823707868
18548. fuzzy caterpillars snails with their sensitive horns	struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded	to spit tobacco spit.	4.6605801105613605
18549. dead fledgling birds their squashed-looking	nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they	had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags.	3.477368858021025
18550. and	the	cast shell of a locust straw-colored and transparent weighing nothing	fragile but entire with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down	its back.	4.626022405706249
18551. every morning early in the summer we searched the trunks	of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells carefully	detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung and stabled	them a weird faery herd in an angle between the high roots of the	tulip tree where no grass grew in the dense shade h.	3.132842399066707
18552. we collected	lucky stones- all the creamy translucent pebbles worn smooth	and round that we could find in the driveway.	5.208118145116785
18553. when these had been	pocketed we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles	for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their	dull exteriors indicated.	3.2174403490529166
18554. we showed them to each other and said would	you have guessed h?	6.857730457582792
18555.  squatting on our haunches beside the	flat stone we broke them on we were safe behind the high closed gates	at the end of the drive: safe from interruption and the observation	and possible amusement of the passers-by.	3.1974766805208334
18556. thus shielded we played	many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness; even when the	fences became a part of the game- when a vine-embowered gate-post	was the sleeping beauty's enchanted castle or when rapunzel let	down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire even then we paid	little heed to those who went by on the path outside.	4.660769599810496
18557. we enjoyed	a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school.	4.173211050415284
18558. in	the heat of the summer the garden solitudes were ours alone; our	elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch.	5.711678519498091
18559. they	never troubled themselves about us while we were playing because	the fence formed such a definite boundary and don't go outside	the gate was a command so impossible of misinterpretation.	3.108592319019096
18560. we were	not however entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street.	5.993736134852404
18561. we were forbidden to swing on the gates lest they sag on their	hinges in a poor-white-trash way but we could stand on them when they	were latched rest our chins on the top and stare and stare committing	to memory quite unintentionally all the details that lay before	our eyes.	3.1267067396891766
18562. the street that is full now of traffic and parked	cars then and for many years drowsed on an august afternoon in the shade	of the curbside trees and silence was a weight almost palpable	in the air.	4.689851503155139
18563. every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell	away again crushed beneath it.	3.6434483758627145
18564. a hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter	the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees and loose	straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves.	4.655775965263587
18565. a wheel squeaked	on a hub was still and squeaked again.	3.6105940773939293
18566. if a child watched its progress	he whispered hay hay load of hay- make a wish and turn	away and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the	sound of the horses' feet returned no more.	4.7582670168253065
18567. when the hay wagon had	gone and an interval passed a huckster's cart might turn the corner.	3.6902969294727845
18568. the horse walked the reins were slack the huckster rode with bowed	shoulders his forearms across his knees.	4.506875006841803
18569. sleepily as if half-reluctant	to break the silence he lifted his voice: rhu-beb-ni-ice	fresh rhu-beb today! the lazy sing-song was spaced in time	like the drone of a bumble-bee.	2.979541013499746
18570. no one seemed to hear him no one heeded.	7.425428615598744
18571. the horse plodded on and he repeated his call.	3.832012304610769
18572. it became so monotonous	as to seem a part of the quietness.	7.829151812529835
18573. after his passage the street	was empty again.	4.8658357612918595
18574. the sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down;	the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk from sidewalk	to lawn.	4.587715559905771
18575. at four-o'clock or four-thirty the coming of the newsboy	marked the end of the day; he tossed a paper toward every front	door and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read	what their neighbors had been doing.	3.4078826870351144
18576. the streets of any county	town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer; they were	like this fifty-odd years ago and yesterday.	4.775111930248899
18577. but the fences were still	in place fifty-odd years ago and when we stood on the gate to look	over the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving	stones with grass between and on both sides.	3.3370228818714596
18578. the curb was a line	of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost	in the ground or the roots of trees.	4.879434572064532
18579. opposite every gate was a hitching	post or a stone carriage-step set with a rusty iron ring for tying	a horse.	3.415592819546255
18580. the street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center;	it was mud in wet weather and dust ankle-deep in dry and could	be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones.	4.492350099124331
18581. it had	a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since.	4.883923532509512
18582. the hoofmarks of	cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as	numerous as the traces of shod horses.	4.937785395405491
18583. cows were kept in backyard barns	boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge	of town and familiar to the ear morning and evening were the boys'	coaxing voices the thud of hooves and the thwack of a stick on cowhide.	3.193641927352854
18584. it is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story	because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and	makes of them a curious riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant	for mann's work.	4.968060877828429
18585. the wife amra and her lover are	both savagely portrayed she as incarnate sensuality voluptuous	and indolent possibly a mischief maker with a kind	of luxurious cunning to set against her apparent simplicity her birdlike	brain.	2.8545068072216093
18586. la^utner for his part belonged to the present-day	race of small artists who do not demand the utmost of themselves	and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets	as wretched little poseurs the devastating indictment they	do not know how to be wretched decently and in order and the somewhat	extreme prophecy so far not fulfilled: they will be destroyed.	4.765224795473522
18587. the trick these two play upon jacoby reveals their want	not simply of decency but of imagination as well.	3.0310705120882218
18588. his appearance as	lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience; it is a spectacle	absolutely painful an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed	by spirit untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation.	4.667033399230575
18589. at the same time the multiple transvestitism involved- the fat	man as girl and as baby as coquette pretending to be a baby- touches	for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like jacoby's	upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human	life.	3.4115661123700836
18590. the music which la^utner has composed for this episode	is for the most part rather pretty and perfectly banal.	5.4254353651816905
18591. but	it is characteristic of him we are told his little artifice	to be able to introduce into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of	hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art.	3.4090549947372013
18592. and this occurs	now at the refrain of jacoby's song- at the point in fact of	the name lizzy-; a modulation described as almost a stroke	of genius.	5.169096138785965
18593. a miracle a revelation it was like a curtain suddenly	torn away to reveal something nude.	3.520058745199458
18594. it is this modulation	which reveals to jacoby his own frightful abjection and simultaneously	his wife's infidelity.	5.317010153252048
18595. by the same means he perceives this fact	as having communicated itself to the audience; he collapses and dies.	3.709390291492675
18596. in the work of every artist i suppose there may be found	one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive	ultimately emblematic of what it is all about; not less strikingly	so for being mysterious as though some deeply hidden constatation of	thoughts were enciphered in a single image a single moment.	5.165867757378307
18597. the horrifying humor the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke	gone wrong the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore	dressing up as a baby; the epiphany of that quivering flesh; the	bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent	mindless sensuality and sharp shrewd talent cleverness with an occasional	touch of genius	; the miraculous way in which music revelation	and death are associated in a single instant- all this seems	a triumph of art a rather desperate art in itself; beyond itself	also	it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of mann's	work.	2.873676016695781
18598. when i try to work out my reasons for feeling that	this passage is of critical significance i come up with the following	ideas which i shall express very briefly here and revert to in	a later essay.	5.394910099828135
18599. love is the crucial dilemma of experience for mann's	heroes.	4.451861805226794
18600. the dramatic construction of his stories characteristically	turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled	and forbidden to love.	4.759605950480407
18601. the release the freedom involved in loving	another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible;	and the motion toward it brings disaster.	3.079594525301653
18602. this prohibition	on love has an especially poignant relation to art; it is particularly	the artist who suffers	from it.	4.932879381207775
18603. the specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem	of the breakthrough in the realm of art.	3.526820585898258
18604. again the sufferings	and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment	not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another	with childhood with the figure of a child.	5.244115927438094
18605. finally the	theatrical notions of dressing up cosmetics	disguise and especially change of costume	are characteristically associated with the catastrophes	of mann's stories.	3.483808647435271
18606. we shall return to these statements	and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates.	5.973148127118192
18607. for the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of	jacoby at the moment of his collapse all these elements come together	in prophetic parody.	4.03272654096038
18608. professionally a lawyer that is to say associated	with dignity reserve discipline with much that is essentially	middle-class he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself	dressed up disguised- that is paradoxically revealed- as a	child and worse as a whore masquerading as a child.	4.667717962933567
18609. that this abandonment	takes place on a stage during an 'artistic' performance	is enough to associate jacoby with art and to bring down upon him the	punishment for art; that is he is suspect guilty punishable as	is anyone in mann's stories who produces illusion and this is	true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature technique	magic guilt and suffering are divided in this story between jacoby	and la^utner.	3.108957875724961
18610. it appears that the dominant tendency of	mann's early tales however pictorial or even picturesque the surface	is already toward the symbolic the emblematic the expressionistic.	4.818960518698629
18611. in a certain perfectly definite way the method and the theme of his	stories are one and the same.	4.170357164269584
18612. something of this can be learned	from the way to the churchyard an anecdote about	an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die	of a stroke or seizure.	5.308041422864533
18613. there is no more plot than that; only	slightly more perhaps than a newspaper account of such an incident	would give.	3.9188884781660813
18614. the artistic interest then lies in what the encounter	may be made to represent in the power of some central significance	to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness.	4.987285498183385
18615. the first	sentence with its platitudinous irony announces an emblematic intent:	the way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad ran	beside it all the way to the end; that is to say to the churchyard.	3.708133211782333
18616. and the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction.	7.014285061233633
18617. the highroad one might say at first belongs to life while	the way to the churchyard belongs to death.	3.8511242361858957
18618. but that is too simple	and won't hold up.	7.40918309850492
18619. as the first sentence suggests both roads belong	to death in the end.	4.562451444359857
18620. but the highroad according to the description	of its traffic belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death	while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life:	a suffering form an existence wholly comprised in the awareness	of death.	5.463181507532914
18621. thus on the highroad a troop of soldiers marched in their	own dust and sang while on the footpath one man walks alone.	3.5068200579952564
18622. this man's isolation is not merely momentary it is permanent.	6.103903986367326
18623. he is a widower his three children are dead he has no one left on	earth; also he is a drunk and has lost his job on that account.	3.925599360812249
18624. his	name is praisegod piepsam and he is rather fully described as to	his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister	type in the author's repertory- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic	strangers in death in venice for example who represent	some combination of cadaver exotic and psychopomp.	4.780596909294257
18625. this strange	person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path	rather than the highroad.	3.8511310692362235
18626. the cyclist a sufficiently commonplace	young fellow is not named but identified simply as life- that	and a license number which piepsam uses in addressing him.	4.398578392251495
18627. life	points out that everybody uses this path and starts to ride	on.	3.743123511235477
18628. piepsam tries to stop him by force receives a push in the chest	from life and is left standing in impotent and growing rage	while a crowd begins to gather.	5.032781683558093
18629. his rage assumes a religious form;	that is on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness	piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of god	imprecates doom on life- not only the cyclist now but the audience	the world as well: all you light-headed breed.	3.575687894632118
18630. this passion	brings on a fit which proves fatal.	6.13512748562702
18631. then an ambulance comes along	and they drive praisegod piepsam away.	3.953774883734568
18632. this is simple enough	but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant.	6.129756678588884
18633. the	season between spring and summer belongs to life in its carefree	aspect.	4.3868476616318635
18634. piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because he cannot	stop the cyclist but also because god will not stop him; as piepsam	says to the crowd in his last moments: his justice is not of	this world.	4.913620548592222
18635. life is further characterized in antithesis to	piepsam as animal: the image of a dog which appears at several	places is first given as the criterion of amiable irrelevant interest	aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle: a dog in a wagon	is admirable a pleasure to contemplate; another wagon	has no dog and therefore is devoid of interest.	3.0259231235914474
18636. piepsam calls	the cyclist cur and puppy among other things and at the crisis	of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into	his face.	5.213544324715201
18637. the ambulance is drawn by two charming little horses.	3.460369349486289
18638. piepsam is not certainly religious in any conventional sense.	6.556550289436493
18639. his religiousness is intimately or dialectically connected with	his sinfulness; the two may in fact be identical.	3.41145471910332
18640. his unsuccessful	strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings;	he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home and before this wardrobe praisegod	piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees and in	his wrestlings had bitten his tongue- and still in the end capitulated.	4.9499740134039225
18641. the cyclist by contrast blond and blue-eyed is simply	unreflective unproblematic life blithe and carefree.	3.0980059395197
18642. he	made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth.	6.312743341198674
18643. piepsam is grotesque a disturbing parody; his end is ridiculous	and trivial.	3.8356416467806045
18644. he is a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard.	8.29305664555896
18645. but he is more interesting than the others the ones who come from	the highroad to watch him more interesting than life considered	as a cyclist.	3.827348785449433
18646. and if i have gone into so much detail about so small	a work that is because it is also so typical a work representing the	germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in mann's writing:	the crude sketch of piepsam contains in its critical destructive	and self-destructive tendencies much that is enlarged and illuminated	in the figures of for instance naphta and leverku^hn.	4.986741040698484
18647. in method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details	selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for realism	anticipates a kind of musical composition as well as a kind of fictional	composition in which as leverku^hn says there shall be	nothing unthematic.	3.7886228283882444
18648. it resembles too pictures such as du^rer	and bruegel did in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial	proves on inspection to be also literary the representation of a	proverb for example or a deadly sin.	4.885244588286568
18649. gladius dei	resembles the way to the churchyard in its representation	of a conflict between light and dark between life and a spirit	of criticism negation melancholy but it goes considerably further	in characterizing the elements of this conflict.	3.4938589713764308
18650. the monk savonarola	brought over from the renaissance and placed against the background	of munich at the turn of the century protests against the luxurious	works displayed in the art-shop of m bluthenzweig; in	particular against a madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled	according to gossip upon the painter's mistress.	4.389347989404208
18651. hieronymus	like piepsam makes his protest quite in vain and his rejection though	not fatal is ridiculous and humiliating; he is simply thrown out	of the shop by the porter.	3.0847460756917937
18652. on the street outside hieronymus envisions	a holocaust of the vanities of this world such a burning of artistic	and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in	florence and prophetically he issues his curse: gladius dei	super terram cito et velociter.	4.4350766199746685
18653. the reality to which they respond is rationally empty and their	art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and	empty world.	3.2081224312612595
18654. their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason.	6.72352060597446
18655. these polar concerns reflect	a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing	over a long period of time.	3.986379701674713
18656. the breakdown of classical structures of	meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations	of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes.	4.7033943677619074
18657. thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal	and spiritual qualities and complete objectification in sub-human and	quasi-mechanistic powers.	3.642055295775078
18658. the image of the world tends to reflect the	hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces	and overwhelming mystery.	5.636663178700594
18659. the image of god has simply disappeared.	4.771011601880828
18660. all such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory	response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism:	if man can neither know nor love reality as it is he can at	least invent an artistic reality which is its own world and which	can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable	of being known and worthy of being loved.	4.907949883451558
18661. the person of the artist	becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by	the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical	systems.	3.2769958915809694
18662. whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and	whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding	the artistic imagination it will be readily seen that they are not mutually	exclusive that they belong together.	5.45446556508078
18663. without the decay of a	sense of objective reference the	stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into	being.	3.634416387416098
18664. and although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves	insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art their peculiar	authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously	and gives promise that from their very substance new and valid	chapters in the philosophy of art may be written.	5.159417389822263
18665. for better or worse	we cannot regard imitation in the arts in the simple mode of	classical rationalism or detached realism.	3.6172364831108643
18666. a broader concept of imitation	is needed one which acknowledges that true invention is important	that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic	causal factors out of which it arises.	4.62715309027267
18667. on the other hand we cannot regard	artistic invention as pure uncaused and unrelated to the times	in which it occurs.	3.7141928489386604
18668. we need a doctrine of imitation to save us from	the solipsism and futility of pure formalism.	6.009739708989989
18669. accordingly it is the	aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation	call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of	and a new theory of invention	.	3.5743293091013837
18670. the arts	the word mimesis is usually associated	with plato and aristotle.	4.985361578836881
18671. for plato imitation is twice	removed from reality being a poor copy of physical appearance which	in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence.	3.663038549596215
18672. all artistic and mythological	representations therefore are imitations of imitations and	are completely superseded by the truth value of dialectic the	proper use of the inquiring intellect.	5.216666388096817
18673. in plato's judgment the	arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young	prior to the full development of their intellectual powers.	3.731932490036408
18674. presupposed	in plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight in which	a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating	to the most sublime wisdom.	4.759882635553747
18675. aristotle also tended to stratify all	aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and	like plato he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level.	3.257450115660097
18676. the poetics in affirming that all human arts are modes	of imitation gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than	did plato.	4.539397568489035
18677. but aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented	it by describing in the poetics what kinds of character and	action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and	important human truths.	3.7908380098663694
18678. for both plato and aristotle artistic mimesis	in contrast to the power of dialectic is relatively incapable of	expressing the character of fundamental reality.	5.779915409069291
18679. the central	concern of erich auerbach's impressive volume called mimesis	is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation	to a christian theory of imitation	in which the levels are dissolved.	2.930944109390738
18680. following the theme of incarnation	in the gospels the christian artist and critic sees in the most	commonplace and ordinary events figures of divine power and reality.	5.016632326788623
18681. here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation	in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent.	3.7372947530088023
18682. artistic mimesis under christian influence records the involvement	of all persons however humble in a divine drama.	4.946540683325256
18683. the artist unlike	the philosopher is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified	high levels of abstraction.	3.4982065435643
18684. he is the conveyor of a sacred reality	by which he has been grasped.	7.371967856780534
18685. i have chosen to use the word mimesis	in its christian rather than its classic implications and	to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological	expression which as in the christian mind are the direct consequence	of involvement in historical experience which are not reserved	as in the greek mind only to moments of theoretical reflection.	3.3853799646850145
18686. in the first instance mimesis is here used to mean the	recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms	of abstract ideas or conventional designations.	5.92152891945113
18687. by image is meant	not only a visual presentation but also remembered sensations of any	of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined	therewith.	3.3292242947184176
18688. this is the primary function of the imagination operating	in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images	were first appropriated.	6.353887874932947
18689. mimesis is the nearest possible thing to	the actual re-living of experience in which the imagining person recovers	through images something of the force and depth characteristic	of experience itself.	3.7250275376823803
18690. the images themselves like their counterparts	in experience are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately;	they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities	and a unique relatedness to one another.	4.3050032859246405
18691. they bring an inextricable	component of value within themselves with attractions and repulsions	native to their own quality.	3.8736877386750277
18692. as in experience one is seized by	given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in	value feelings to them so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation	of images.	5.039995935861949
18693. mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism	or realism in the conventional sense.	4.390834516967047
18694. a word taken in its dictionary	meaning a photographic image of a recognizable object the mere picturing	of a scene tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote	such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without	the incitement of value feelings.	4.515964854326748
18695. similarly experience itself can	be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues	for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential	field.	3.586590279523843
18696. a truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection	to a sense of immediacy.	5.8646498434733445
18697. the mimetic character of the	imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation	of artistic forms and materials.	3.168650939557141
18698. when words can be used in a more fresh	and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and	sounds when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape	all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of	themselves compelling the observer into an attitude of attention all	this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes	upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance.	4.802433735453558
18699. these	are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self	and thrusts the self into decision and choice.	3.9294976212904023
18700. the presence of genuine	mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work	demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely	understood.	5.49394403412422
18701. underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain	presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which	require some exposition before the main argument can proceed.	3.3418491348556536
18702. experience	is not seen as it is in classical rationalism as presenting	us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space	and	registering their character movements and changes on the tabula	rasa of an uninvolved intellect.	4.908336837717875
18703. neither is primary experience understood	according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing	is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing	their responses in the appropriate sense organs.	3.557206721252447
18704. primary feelings	of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects	nor a collection of isolated and	neutral sensory qualities.	5.3993646783546625
18705. in contrast to all this primary data are	data of a self involved in environing processes and powers.	3.6910853327000175
18706. the	most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings both positive	and negative: a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment	into oneself; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other	part.	5.319610815051028
18707. these desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers	in which one is involved some working for one's good others threatening	ill.	3.6656230892409445
18708. gone is the tabula rasa of the mind.	6.105888876451725
18709. in its place	is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive	or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined	by constellations of process in which one is caught.	3.3279042541282897
18710. the principal	defender of this view of primary experience as causal efficacy	is alfred north whitehead.	5.022307935955788
18711. our most elemental and unavoidable	impressions he says are those of being involved in a large arena of	powers which have a longer past than our own which are interrelated	in a vast movement through the present toward the future.	3.543053962546631
18712. we feel the	quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening.	6.231065264134466
18713. later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors	of judgment in these apprehensions of value but the apprehensions themselves	are the primary stuff of experience.	3.3759970752441304
18714. it takes a great deal	of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger	unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a	collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern	devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far	as they present themselves for inspection.	4.850392891448725
18715. whitehead is here questioning	david hume's understanding of the nature of experience; he	is questioning also every epistemology which stems from hume's	presupposition	that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from	causal efficacy and that causal efficacy is something intellectually	imputed to the world not directly perceived.	3.3189062988453464
18716. what hume calls sensation	is what whitehead calls perception in the mode of presentational	immediacy which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception	in the mode of causal efficacy.	5.280521654960541
18717. as long as perception is seen as	composed only of isolated sense data most of the quality and interconnectedness	of existence loses its objectivity becomes an invention	of consciousness and the result is a philosophical scepticism.	3.8290058501151174
18718. whitehead	contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity	of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other	and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because	the basic form of such an understanding for all its vagueness and	tendency to mistake the detail is initially given in the way man	feels the world.	5.149783969918688
18719. in this respect experience is broader and full of	a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of	his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct.	3.5221346960664572
18720. a chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is	one of derivation from the past.	5.606751952688956
18721. both i and my feelings come up out	of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are	ultimately very unlike the entity which i now am.	3.5271990287452426
18722. after only eighteen years of non-interference there were already indications	of melioration though in a slight degree to be sure.	5.507120831534622
18723. there were more indications by the mid-twentieth century.	4.900243531054662
18724. i leave	it to the statisticians to say what they were but i noticed several	a few years ago during an automobile ride from memphis to hattiesburg.	5.6384805093554045
18725. in town after town my companion pointed out the negro school	and the white school and in every instance the former made a better	appearance.	3.5211278526145358
18726. it really looked as if a	change of the sort predicted by booker t washington had been going	on.	5.792366059226839
18727. but with the renewal of interference in 1954	the improvement was impaired.	4.201045499198756
18728. for over a hundred	years southerners have felt that the north was picking on them.	6.570004089151466
18729. it's infuriating this feeling that one is being picked on continually	constantly.	4.1632954000165014
18730. by what right of superior virtue southerners ask	do the people of the north do this?	6.962039310471889
18731.  the traditional strategy of the	south has been to expose the vices of the north to demonstrate that	the north possessed no superior virtue to show the world that	however	bad i may be you're not quite the people to say it.	3.421261068392323
18732. in the pre-civil war years the south argued that the slave was	not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the north.	5.283759409410611
18733. at	the present time the counter-attack takes the line that there's no	more of the true spirit of integration in the north than	in the south.	3.853885085315195
18734. the line is a pretty good one.	6.617610104319872
18735. people talk about	the law of the land.	5.381421861851971
18736. the expression has become quite a cliche.	5.600645518428826
18737. but people can't be made to integrate socialize	by law.	4.549420813498384
18738. i was having lunch not	long ago with three distinguished	historians	and i asked them if they	could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed	with deliberate speed majestic instancy	by judicial fiat.	4.689859898096263
18739. they didn't seem to be able to think of any.	6.024412300110659
18740. a virginia	judge a while back cited a roman jurist to the effect that ten years	might be a reasonable length of time for such a change.	5.386387543862919
18741. but i suspect	that the old roman was referring to change made under military occupation-	the sort of change which tacitus was talking about when he	said they make a desert and call it peace	.	3.3122406211746367
18742. moreover the law of the land is not	irrevocable; it can be changed; it has been many times.	7.442193788039062
18743. mr	justice taney's dred scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the	north and soon became a dead letter.	3.324822066988436
18744. prohibition was the law of the	land but it was unpopular	in prohibition days drinking was so gay so fashionable especially	and was repealed.	5.338775771712962
18745. the cliche loses	its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history.	3.8978488251063443
18746. the	declaration of independence says that governments derive their	just powers from the consent of the governed.	5.564089305846292
18747. the phrase consent	of the governed needs a hard look.	3.8220772097400117
18748. how do we define it?	9.306751920124869
18749.  is the	consent of the governed a numerical majority?	5.003659881117649
18750.  calhoun dealt with	this question in his disquisition on government.	5.760264500069021
18751. to guard	against the tyranny of a numerical majority calhoun developed his	theory of concurrent majority which he said by giving to	each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the	action of government a negative on the others prevents all partial	or local legislation.	3.425543283286917
18752. who will say that our country is even now a	homogeneous community?	7.0268357215599035
18753.  that regional peculiarities do not still exist?	4.7716089972431694
18754. 	that the court order does not unequally affect the southern region?	5.707686842918412
18755. 	who will deny that in a vast portion of the south the federal	action is incompatible with the jeffersonian concept of the consent	of the governed?	3.9400699922795437
18756.    circumstances alter cases.	8.916031984299796
18757. a friend	of mine in new mexico said the court order had caused no particular	trouble out there that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell.	3.5099417784240616
18758. he	seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular	trouble anywhere.	6.1540986411326495
18759. i murmured something about a possible difference between	new mexico's history and mississippi's.	4.1393017332655155
18760. one can meet	with aloofness almost anywhere: the thank-heaven-we're-not-involved	viewpoint it doesn't affect us! southern liberals	- especially if they're rich- often exhibit	blithe insouciance.	4.733029516720514
18761. the trouble here is that it's almost too easy	to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything.	3.366626405048508
18762. you've already sent your daughter to miss x's select academy	for girls and your son to mr y's select academy for boys and	you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity.	4.530433050316118
18763. if there's	no suitable academy in your own neighborhood there's always new	england.	4.326449950993005
18764. new england academies welcome fugitives from the provinces	south as well as west.	6.977874499649772
18765. they may even enroll a colored student	or two for show though he usually turns out to be from thailand or	any place other than the american south.	3.6989732428794047
18766. it would be interesting to	know how much integration there is in the famous fashionable colleges	and prep schools of new england.	6.300469959200005
18767. a recent newspaper report	said there were five negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one	thousand at yale; that is about one-half of one per cent which	looks pretty tokenish to me especially in an institution which	professes to be national.	3.3174559143809286
18768. i must confess that i prefer	the liberal who is personally affected who is willing to send his own	children to a mixed school as proof of his faith.	5.014143784402108
18769. i leave out of account	the question of the best interests of the children the question	of what their best interests really are.	4.510066315078392
18770. i'm talking about the grand	manner of the liberal- north and south- who is not affected	personally.	5.789621554825615
18771. if these people were denied a voice	what voices would be left?	4.318138989626752
18772.  who is involved	willy nilly?	9.51226724470794
18773.  well after everybody has followed the new england	pattern of segregating one's children into private schools	only the poor folks are left.	3.514393307546411
18774. and it is precisely in this poorer economic	class that one finds and has always found the most racial friction.	6.005741724273586
18775. a dear respected friend of mine who like myself grew up	in the south and has spent many years in new england said to me	not long ago: i can't forgive new england for rejecting	all complicity.	3.2814069436507114
18776. being a teacher of american literature i remembered	whittier's massachusetts to virginia where he said:	but that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone	and reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown.	4.582500357077422
18777. there	is a legend	to the effect that the	mayflower	on its second voyage brought a cargo of negro slaves.	3.9509739315583583
18778. whether	historically a fact or not the legend has a certain symbolic value.	6.0851416852805125
18779. complicity is an embarrassing word.	4.77450775251771
18780. it is something	which most of us try to get out from under.	7.611648888735043
18781. like the cowboy in stephen	crane's blue hotel we run around crying well i	didn't do anything did i?	3.6789046555804927
18782.  robert penn warren puts it this	way in brother to dragons: the recognition of complicity	is the beginning of innocence where innocence i think means	about the same thing as redemption.	5.342134976644581
18783. a man must be able to say father	i have sinned	or there is no hope for him.	4.804480236735757
18784. lincoln understood	this better than most when he said in his second inaugural	that god gives to both north and south this terrible war as the	woe due to those by whom the offense came.	5.320086991450609
18785. he also spoke of the	wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited	toil.	3.8270933713969115
18786. lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that	a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of	the descendants of new englanders engaged in the slave trade.	5.284391528814095
18787. after	how many generations is such wealth	purified of taint?	3.9424304588356365
18788.  it is a question	which new englanders long ago put out of their minds.	6.394358203165421
18789. but didn't	they get off too easy?	4.725633813044821
18790.  the slaves never shared in their profits	while they did share in a very real sense in the profits of the	slave-owners: they were fed clothed doctored and so forth; they	were the beneficiaries of responsible paternalistic care.	4.612435792292829
18791. emerson- platonist idealist doctrinaire- sounded a high transcendental	note in his boston hymn delivered in 1863 in the boston music	hall amidst thundering applause: pay ransom to the owner and	fill the bag to the brim.	2.9548288662656725
18792. who is the owner?	11.560986682156738
18793.  the slave is owner	and ever was.	3.7317646619101095
18794. pay him! it is the abstractionism the unrealism	of the pure idealist.	6.495358798582078
18795. it ignores the sordid financial aspects	conveniently too for his audience who could indulge in moral indignation	without visible or even conscious discomfort their money	from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic	.	3.3332204054530212
18796. like pilate they had washed their hands.	7.19032553366473
18797. but can one	really?	6.482944732679671
18798.  can god be mocked ever in the long run?	7.366717994895484
18799.    new	englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in	negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the declaration of independence	as jefferson explained in his autobiography:	the clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of africa	was struck out in complaisance to south carolina and georgia who	had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves and who on	the contrary still wished to continue it.	3.15795055060316
18800. our northern brethren also	i believe felt a little tender under those censures; for though their	people had very few slaves themselves yet they had been pretty considerable	carriers of them to others.	5.046733086479201
18801. but that was a long	time ago.	6.002042106195393
18802. the new england conscience became desensitized.	7.442469987582185
18803. george	w cable writing in 1889 from paradise	road northampton agitated continuously	the southern question.	3.3543825128503357
18804. it was nice to be able to isolate	it.	8.177497920153511
18805. new england as everyone knows has long been schoolmaster	to the nation.	4.478138180818141
18806. there one finds concentrated in a comparatively	small area the chief universities colleges and preparatory schools	of the united states.	5.722602617571642
18807. why should this be so?	6.150002234233329
18808.  it is true that new	england more than any other section was dedicated to education	from the start.	6.154828948837702
18809. but i think that something more than this is involved.	5.670131038847877
18810. how did it happen for example that the state university	that great symbol of american democracy failed to flourish in new england	as it did in other parts of the country?	5.690622755344736
18811.  isn't it a bit odd	that the three states of southern new england	have had state institutions of university	status only in the very recent past these institutions having previously	been a+m colleges?	3.3657419512760542
18812.  was it supposed perchance that	a+m was quite sufficient for the	immigrant class which flooded that part of the new england world in	the post-civil war period the immigrants having been brought in from	southern europe to work in the mills to make up for the labor	shortage caused by migration to the west?	5.375890016275309
18813.  is it not ironical that	roger williams's state rhode island should have been the very	last of the forty-eight to establish a state university?	4.109052315309428
18814.  the state	universities of maine new hampshire and vermont are older and more	respectable; they had less immigration to contend with.	4.453522558284031
18815. a yale historian writing a few years ago in the yale review	said: we in new england have long since segregated our children.	3.8722939717338414
18816. he was referring not only to the general college situation	but more especially to the preparatory schools.	6.456838482932297
18817. and what a galaxy of	those adorns that fair land! i don't propose to go into their history	but i have one or two surmises.	3.655853311168834
18818. one is that they were established	or gained eminence under pressure provided by these same immigrants	from whom the old families wished to segregate their children.	5.795077702472389
18819. in the early days of a homogeneous population the public school was	quite satisfactory.	4.541723672085818
18820. among the recipients of the nobel prize for literature	more than half are practically unknown to readers of english.	5.6381829477416545
18821. of these	there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than	verner von heidenstam the swedish poet and novelist who received	the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago.	3.2713689313316916
18822. equally a master of prose and verse he recreates the glory of sweden	in the past and continues it into the present.	5.398214332737085
18823. in the following sketch	we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as	possible speak for himself.	4.018774642238736
18824. heidenstam was born in 1859 of	a prosperous family.	7.373063859151278
18825. on his father's side he was of german descent	on his mother's he came of the old swedish nobility.	4.154620019611672
18826. the family	estate was situated near vadstena on lake va^ttern in south central	sweden.	4.661013058758291
18827. it is a lonely rather desolate region but full of legendary	and historic associations.	3.9209800156696253
18828. as a boy in a local school he was shy	and solitary absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of	sweden's ancient glory.	5.598617072951098
18829. he liked to fancy himself as a chieftain	and to dress for the part.	4.143908700824109
18830. being somewhat delicate in health at the	age of sixteen he was sent to southern europe for which he at once	developed a passion so that he spent nearly all of the following ten	years abroad at first in italy then in greece egypt asia minor	and palestine.	5.068970640938048
18831. in one of his summers at home he married to the	great disapproval of his father who objected because of his extreme youth.	4.232078175194553
18832. deciding to become a painter he entered the studio of gerome	in paris where he enjoyed the life of the artists but soon found	that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction.	5.571553773992182
18833. he gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem the	happy artists.	3.9064423945305338
18834. i scanned the world through printed symbol	swart and through the beggar's rags i strove to see the inner man.	5.8687523164950814
18835. i looked unceasingly with my cold mind and with my burning heart.	4.005448972544812
18836. in this final line we have the key to his nature.	8.039949647650397
18837. few writers	have better understood their deepest selves.	4.558855116260103
18838. heidenstam could never be	satisfied by surface.	7.1448440164045275
18839. it may however be noted that his gift for color	and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in paris.	4.0427166606426574
18840. the first result of heidenstam's long sojourn abroad was	a volume of poems pilgrimage and wander-years	published in 1888.	5.0769452586775214
18841. it was a brilliant debut so much so	indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets as did byron's	childe harold.	3.648977491241721
18842. professor fredrik bo^o^k sweden's	foremost critic of the period acclaims it as follows: in	this we have the verse of a painter; strongly colorful plastic racy	vivid.	5.355784565331482
18843. in a bold sometimes careless form there is nothing academic;	all is seen and felt and experienced the observation is sharp	and the imagination lively.	3.6178029426362834
18844. the young poet-painter reproduces the french	life of the streets; he tells stories of the thousand and one	nights and conjures up before us the bazaars of damascus.	4.474274035047045
18845. in the	care-free indolence of the east he sees the last reflection of the	old happy existence and for that reason he loves it.	3.7398145683092223
18846. and yet amid all	the gay hedonism in pilgrimage and wander-years is a cycle of	short poems thoughts in loneliness filled with brooding melancholy	and sombre longing.	4.73776055618012
18847. of the longer pieces of the volume	none is so memorable as nameless and immortal which at	once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the swedish language.	3.55060190248491
18848. it celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of	neptune at paestum next to the parthenon the noblest example of grecian	classic style now in existence.	5.140939620548047
18849. on the eve of his return to their	native naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises	before them in its completed perfection.	3.9497239135998536
18850. the supreme object of their	lives is now fulfilled says the wife her husband has achieved immortality.	5.214254507390788
18851. not so he answers it is not the architect but the temple	that is immortal.	5.169093477349946
18852. the man's true reputation is his work.	5.336781553834515
18853. the short poems grouped at the end of the volume as thoughts	in loneliness is as professor bo^o^k indicated in sharp contrast	with the others.	3.3912252886927647
18854. it consists of fragmentary personal revelations	such as the spark: there is a spark dwells deep within	my soul.	5.9018262771114705
18855. to get it out into the daylight's glow is my life's	aim both first and last the whole.	4.30315704928437
18856. it slips away it burns and tortures	me.	7.111751802877177
18857. that little spark is all the wealth i know that little spark	is my life's misery.	4.194518055474484
18858. a dominant motive is the poet's longing	for his homeland and its boyhood associations: not men-folk but	the fields where i would stray the stones where as a child i used	to play.	4.4932234974094545
18859. he is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory	life he has been leading.	5.034189344995127
18860. what he really wants is to find a	sacred cause to which he can honestly devote himself.	6.579362513208018
18861. this restless	individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all	the rest of his life in sweden.	4.070681732269
18862. his cause was to commemorate the glory	of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present.	5.388255826414048
18863. he did not however find himself at once.	5.236302808106863
18864. his next major	work completed in 1892 was a long fantastic epic in prose entitled	hans alienus which professor bo^o^k describes as a monument	on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth.	4.529714342659421
18865. the hero who is	himself is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the east	a sort of faustus type who to quote from professor bo^o^k again	even in the pleasure gardens of sardanapalus can not cease from	his painful search after the meaning of life.	2.9562976179786813
18866. he is driven back by	his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of	tiveden.	5.534652632389466
18867. from this time on heidenstam proceeded to find his	deeper self.	4.711623161554298
18868. by the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession	of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions.	6.402281196244032
18869. he	did not however settle back into acquiescence with things as they were.	3.817741979540324
18870. like his friend and contemporary august strindberg he had little	patience with collective mediocrity.	6.0037478534545405
18871. he saw sweden as a country of	smug and narrow provincialism indifferent to the heroic spirit of its	former glory.	3.476361667058654
18872. strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear	down the old structures and build anew from the ground up.	5.484743446599244
18873. heidenstam's	conception on the contrary was to revive the present by the memories	of the past.	3.8928972570502065
18874. whether in prose or poetry all of heidenstam's	later work was concerned with sweden.	6.0837638312029005
18875. with the first of a group	of historical novels the charles men published	in 1897-8 he achieved the masterpiece of his career.	4.3320577811382
18876. in scope	and power it can only be compared to tolstoy's war and peace.	5.885965115344841
18877. about one-third as long it is less intimate and detailed but better	coordinated more concise and more dramatic.	3.7036367478218533
18878. though it centers around	the brilliant and enigmatic figure of charles 12 the true hero	is not finally the king himself.	5.536265077937477
18879. hence the title of the book referring	to the soldiers and subjects of the king; on the fatal battlefield	of poltava to quote from the novel the wreath he twined for	himself slipped down upon his people.	3.4018082790357247
18880. the charles men	consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories	each depicting a special phase of the general subject.	5.345179494583775
18881. somewhat uneven	in interest for an average reader eight or ten of these are among	the finest of their kind in literature.	3.6293552900639994
18882. they comprise a great variety	of scene and interest: grim episodes of war idyllic interludes superb	canvases of world-shaking events and delightfully humorous sketches	of odd characters.	4.523583991436811
18883. the general effect is tragic.	4.670902221004378
18884. almost nothing	is said of charles' spectacular victories the central theme being	the heroic loyalty of the swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune	and defeat.	4.9930558869566735
18885. to carry out this exalted conception the	author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed	in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale.	3.51394170410852
18886. his	peculiar gift as had been suggested before is his intensity.	6.036483238166995
18887. george	meredith has said that fervor is the core of style.	4.60123520567475
18888. of few authors	is this more true than of heidenstam.	6.985888025865876
18889. the charles men has a tremendous	range of characters of common folk even more than of major	figures.	3.4641197775174053
18890. the career of charles 12 is obviously very similar to that	of napoleon.	5.484569704245717
18891. his ideal was alexander of macedon as napoleon's	was julius caesar.	3.673374903678972
18892. his purpose however was not to establish an	empire but to assert the principle of divine justice.	6.705709587185648
18893. each aspired	to be a god in human form but with each it was a different kind of god.	4.339365204797514
18894. each failed catastrophically in an invasion of russia and each brought	ruin on the country that worshipped him.	5.652401570347251
18895. each is still glorified	as a national hero.	5.06685654113972
18896. the first half of the charles men	ending on the climax of the battle of poltava in 1709 is more dramatically	coherent than the second.	5.766548311490796
18897. after the collapse of that desperate	and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a	time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous.	3.8046810619121483
18898. like napoleon he was the worst of losers.	8.396647179328555
18899. there are however some	wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part concerning	the reactions of the swedes in adversity.	4.017432051067474

18915. it is different with his volume the swedes	and their chieftains a history	intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high	school students.	3.421541549207984

18924. it is from this unpromising background that the	fictional private detective was recruited.	5.845700208604104
18925. the mythological	private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential	ways.	3.507147853126764
18926. on the one hand he does not work for a large agency but	is almost always self-employed.	7.03793085817909
18927. as a free-lance investigator the fictional	detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client.	4.020874789957458
18928. for this reason he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure	whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a	9 to 5 routine.	5.430253646636214
18929. on the other hand the fictional detective does not	break strikes or handle divorce cases; no client would ever think of	asking him to do such things.	3.6280977384009545
18930. whatever his original assignment the	fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime usually	a murder.	5.342841747562624
18931. operating as a one man police force in fact if not in	name he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police	themselves.	3.9458470239968926
18932. he catches criminals not merely because he is paid to	do so but because he enjoys	his work because he firmly believes that murder must be punished.	5.141853558665611

18934. he is first and foremost a defender of public morals a servant of	society.	6.037717519649155
18935. it is this curious blend of rugged individualism and	public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological	detective.	3.978783114947882
18936. by virtue of his self-reliance his individualism and	his freedom from external restraint the private eye is a perfect embodiment	of the middle class conception of liberty which amounts to doing	what you please and let the devil take the hindmost.	5.1619173085966406
18937. at the same time	because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal	dictates of his society because he likes to catch criminals he is	in middle class eyes a virtuous man.	3.379516250354767
18938. in this way the private detective	gets the best of two possible worlds.	7.330750461341754

18941. in the mystery story as in the	wealth of nations individualism and the social good are two sides	of the same benevolent coin.	3.6417509797601992
18942. there is only one	catch to this idyllic arrangement: adam smith was wrong.	6.274048412846368
18943. not only	did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest	number he ended by destroying himself by giving birth to monopoly	capitalism.	3.595751971130847
18944. the rise of the giant corporations in western europe	and the united states dates from the period 1880-1900.	5.788492788829464
