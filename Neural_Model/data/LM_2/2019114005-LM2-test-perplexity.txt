SENTENCES AND THEIR PERPLEXITY


1. it exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much	the same criticisms.	4.7994058331280485
2. the treatment seems unnecessarily loose-jointed	and complex largely because the method is lax and the analysis seems	never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point.	4.420139356760884
3. there are more stems per item in athabascan which expresses the fact	that the athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in	diverging from proto-athabascan than the yokuts languages from proto-yokuts.	3.6101782386503007
4. this may be because the athabascan divergence began earlier;	or again because the athabascan languages spread over a very much	larger territory; or both.	5.3795572938044405
5. the differentiation however is not very much greater as shown by	the fact that athabascan shows 3.	3.635973500727342
6. 46 stems per meaning slot as against	2.	6.743273855772659
7. 75 for yokuts with a slightly greater number of languages represented	in our sample: 24 as against 21.	3.8049403881076533
8. 46 the stemitem rate becomes 3.	7.163184125958424
9. 75 in equivalent number	these general facts are mentioned to make clear	that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant	comparison.	3.59307437594464
10. the greatest difference in the two sets of figures	is due to differences in the two sets of lists used.	5.7767543434384345
11. these differences	in turn result from the fact that my yokuts vocabularies were	built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of english meaning	between illiterate informants and myself within a compact and uniform	territorial area but that hoijer's vocabulary is based on swadesh's	second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating	all items which might be culturally or geographically determined.	3.3968249188035573
12. swadesh	in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal;	i one that was specifically adapted to the san joaquin valley.	5.012120988075442
13. the	result is that i included 70 animal names but swadesh only 4;	and somewhat similarly for plants 16 as against 4.	3.5580007126455575
14. swadesh and therefore	hoijer felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even	genera; their	classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or	recurrent parts.	4.63479892887524
15. the groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as	in size.	3.700289227276755
16. other classes are included only by myself	or only by swadesh and hoijer.	6.054401076395405
17. what we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes:	body parts and products which with a proportionally nearly	even representation come out with	nearly even ratios; 2.	3.830909326773194
18. 7; nature	ratios 3.	9.52328749892442
19. 1; ratios 3.	6.939425769494729
20. 7; ratios 4.	9.52328749892442
21. 4.	10.144513917544229
22. it will be seen that where the scope is similar the athabascan ratios	come out somewhat higher	except for verbs where alone the athabascan	ratio is lower.	5.417904497408846
23. this exception may be connected with hoijer's	use of a much higher percentage of verbs: 22% of his total	list as against 3.	3.6996367920686892
24. or the exception may be due to a particular	durability peculiar to the athabascan verb.	6.143044831083067
25. more word class ratios	determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the	question.	4.748688829456456
26. if word classes differ in their resistance or liability	to stem replacement within meaning slot it is conceivable that	individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually.	5.084394816696571
27. hoijer's athabascan and my yokuts share 71 identical meanings	allowance for several near-synonyms like stomach-belly big-large	.	3.8101576301595865
28. for yokuts	i tabulated these 71 items in five columns according as they were expressed	by 1 2 3 4 and more than 4 stems.	5.334417794948754
29. the totals for these	five categories are not too uneven namely 20 15 11 16 9 respectively.	3.6537909074172705
30. for athabascan with a greater range of stems the first two	of five corresponding columns were identical 1 and 2 stems; the three	others had to be spread somewhat and are headed respectively f;	f; and f stems.	4.778526332326125
31. while the particular limits of these groupings	may	seem artificially arbitrary; they do fairly express a corresponding	grouping of more variable material and they eventuate also in five	classes along a similar scale containing approximately equal numbers	of cases namely 19 14 15 11 12 in athabascan.	3.2544160588942965
32. when now	we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing	in the same column or grade or one column or grade apart or	two or three or four we find these differences: f   this distribution	can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart:	f; which divided by f gives a mean of 1.	4.58331025665743
33. if	the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families	the distance would of course be 0.	4.242928840607396
34. if it were wholly random	and unrelated it would be 2.	9.441743161187821
35. 0 assuming the five classes were equal in	n which approximately they are.	4.0683852436856025
36. the actual mean of 1.	6.820060565926031
37. 07 being	about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.	4.317068102383446
38. 0 of no correlation	it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity	in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning	as regards long-term stem displacement.	5.303177255550658
39. in 1960 david d	thomas published basic vocabulary in some mon-khmer languages	which compares 8 mon-khmer languages	with the i-e language data on which swadesh based the revised	retention	rate and his revised 100 word	basic	glottochronological list in towards greater accuracy h	.	3.324890351494083
40. thomas' findings are first that the individual	items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence;	but second that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying	in their average persistence	first conclusion on behavior of individual items is negative whereas	mine was partially positive.	4.334161222767065
41. his second	conclusion	on semantic word classes agrees with mine.	4.876738007440362
42. this second conclusion	independently arrived at by independent study of material from two	pairs of language families as different and remote from one another	as these four are cannot be ignored.	4.687561006133882
43. thomas also presents a	simple equation for deriving an index of persistence which weights not	only the number of stems per meaning but their relative	frequency.	3.860698695999555
44. thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per	meaning is: stem identical in 8 languages 100%; stem frequencies	7 and 1 86%; stem frequencies 4 and 4 64%; stem frequencies	4 3 and 1 57%.	4.599322544019293
45. his formula will have to be weighed may be	altered or improved and it should be tested on additional bodies of	material.	4.674348342743056
46. but consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning	seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations	with diachronic and classificatory relevance; and gleason	presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area.	5.090001590016668
47. as to relative frequencies of competing roots	thomas with his 'weighting' seems to be the first to have considered	the significance this might have.	4.974040328974156
48. the problem needs further	exploration.	8.439097954655827
49. i was at least conscious of the distinction in my full	yokuts presentation that awaits publication in which in listing 'two-stem	meanings' i set off by asterisks those forms in which	n of stem b was f of stem a3 the unasterisked ones	standing for f; or under 'four stems' i set off by asterisks	cases where the combined n of stems f was f.	3.2325272109783376
50. these	findings and others which will in time be developed will affect	the method of glottochronological inquiry.	5.2288514545018705
51. if adjectival meanings show	relatively low retentiveness of stems as i am confident will prove	to be the case in most languages of the world why should our basic	lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms but only 8 per cent	of animals and plants which replace much more slowly?	3.681293806811129
52.  had hoijer	substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items	his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of athabascan	language separation smaller.	5.438228238796028
53. and irrespective of the outcome	in centuries elapsed since splitting calculations obviously carry more	concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable	units	than with variously unstable ones.	3.704412694341627
54. it is evident that swadesh	has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages	but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior	of lexical items.	4.880905743560948
55. why then this urge to include unstable items	in his basic list?	4.879669369659804
56.  it is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical	and cultural conditioning as possible.	6.318568703305467
57. and why that insistence?	7.124264134876056
58. 	it is the hope of attaining a list of items of universal occurrence.	6.51554354056278
59. but it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is	a snare.	5.3585328320687164
60. not that such a list cannot be constructed; but the nearer	it comes to attaining universality the less significant will it be	linguistically.	5.469090218398527
61. its terms will tend to be labile or vague and they	will fit actual languages more and more badly.	4.542698770545563
62. the practical operational	problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic	list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms	of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison.	4.668292995173217
63. the most important	quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as	possible.	5.1903854853966145
64. in proportion as meanings are concrete we can better rely	on their being insulated and distinctive.	5.4156479523307075
65. an elephant or a fox or a swan	or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality	of obvious common-sense indubitable identity as do an eye	or tooth or nail.	3.3464145969412584
66. they isolate out easily naturally and unambiguously	from the continuum of nature and existence; and they should be	given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these	qualities.	5.167386013973179
67. with the universal list as his weapon swadesh	has	extended his march of conquest farther and farther into the past eight	ten twelve millennia back.	3.872679528522426
68. and he has proclaimed greater or less	affiliation between all western hemisphere languages.	6.964083518709223
69. some of this	may prove to be true or even considerable of it whether by genetic	ramification or by diffusion and coalescence.	4.0716559191751465
70. but the farther out he	moves the thinner will be his hold on conclusive evidence and the larger	the speculative component in his inferences.	5.072900957333021
71. he has traversed provinces	and kingdoms but he has not consolidated them behind him nor	does he control them.	4.406927556080255
72. he has announced results on hokan penutian	uto-aztecan and almost all other american families and phyla and	has diagrammed their degree of interrelation; but he has not worked	out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of	even a single family other than salish.	4.7555007485043
73. the	remote cloudy possible has values of its own- values of scope	stimulus potential and imagination.	3.8849121559715263
74. but there is also a firm aspect	to lexicostatistics: the aspect of learning the internal organization	of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well as their more	remote and elusive external links; of classification first with elapsed	age merely a by-product; of acquiring evidential knowledge of	what happened in athabascan in yokuts in uto-aztecan in the last	few thousand years as well as forecasting what more anciently may have	happened between them.	4.81429871321087
75. this involves step-by-step progress and such	will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing	body of scientific inquiry.	4.345784286575918
76. if of the founders of glottochronology	swadesh has escaped our steady plodding and lees has repudiated his	own share in the founding that is no reason why we should swerve.	5.4153698856840995
77. there is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by swadesh's	rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown	so vast.	3.8306828138756637
78. it seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures	for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble solid and limited basis.	5.551469979663382
79. i would propose first an abandonment of attempts at a	universal lexical list as intrinsically unachievable and operationally	inadequate in proportion as it is achieved.	4.181124615290926
80. i would propose	next as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists	items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible.	5.110824743812939
81. there would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme	of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable.	4.74061867324572
82. an attempted	middle course might lead to devices like a 5000-word alphabetized dictionary	from which every fiftieth word was selected.	5.229859021691492
83. doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should	arise about the methods for applying these policies.	3.744109221929566
84. it was nevertheless	almost incredible that four years after yalta there should be a	complete split over germany with hot heads on both sides planning to	use the germans against their former allies and with nazi-minded germans	expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the	other.	4.822510514139816
85. when the yalta conference	opened the american policy of postponing all discussion of russia's	western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down.	3.7988586343395587
86. starting	in great force late in december from a line stretching from	east prussia to budapest the red armies had swept two hundred miles	across poland to the oder thirty miles from berlin and the upper	danube region was being rapidly overrun while the western allies	had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the rhine.	4.3663630441082235
87. the long	delay in opening the second front was now working to russia's advantage.	3.7083798271232222
88. the west was now glad to propose the 1919 curzon line	which was substantially russia's 1941 border as the boundary between	russia and poland.	4.73593314717747
89. when this proposal was made stalin spoke	with stronger emotion than at any other time during the conference.	4.627876777595186
90. he stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject.	6.163304007001088
91. the bitter	memory of russia's exclusion from the paris peace conference	and of the west's effort to stamp out bolshevism at its birth boiled	up within him.	3.2514916836887933
92. you would drive us into shame he declared.	8.02033537540069
93. the white russians and the ukrainians would say that stalin and molotov	were far less reliable defenders of russia than curzon and clemenceau.	3.55765176590205
94. yet after long and earnest discussion stalin accepted	the curzon line and even agreed voluntarily that there should be	digressions from that line of five to eight kilometers in favor of poland	in some regions.	5.018274025737648
95. he did not mind the line itself which churchill	declared in the house of commons on february 27 1945 he had	always believed to be just and right but he did not want it called	by a hated name.	4.247819768898419
96. the west had long since forgotten the events	of 1919 but it was not so easy for the red leaders who felt that they	had suffered great injustice in that period.	5.50999505580018
97. in the dunn-atherton	memorandum of february 4 1942 the state department had expected	to be able to hold russia in check by withholding agreement to	her 1941 boundaries.	4.112234324487636
98. now stalin made it clear that he meant to move	poland's western borders deep into germany back to the western	neisse-oder river lines taking not only east prussia and all of	silesia but pomerania and the tip of brandenburg back to and including	stettin.	4.940910586419788
99. from six to nine million additional germans would be	evicted though most would have fled and poland would receive far more	from germany than the poor territories including the great pripet	marshes which she lost to russia.	3.3470509513476783
100. stalin declared that he preferred	to continue the war a little longer although it costs us blood	in order to give poland compensation in the west at the expense	of the germans.	4.946347724359135
101. by this time churchill was not so cordial toward	moving poland westward as he had been at teheran where he and	eden had both heartily approved the idea.	4.298271995011702
102. after a prolonged study	of the oder line on a map at teheran churchill liked the	picture.	5.942788607905846
103. he would tell the poles he said that they had been given	a fine place to live in more than three hundred miles each way.	5.122374586418834
104. at yalta he thought more about the six million germans who would	have to leave trying to find work in germany and roosevelt objected	to the western neisse river being chosen in the south instead	of the eastern neisse both of which flow into the oder.	4.87640620415319
105. the	issue was left in abeyance presumably for the peace conference.	4.317068102383446
106. however	there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong	poland both industrially and agriculturally and one unplagued by large	minorities of germans or russians.	5.1421887147197
107. the moving of millions of the	german master-race from the very heart of junkerdom to make room	for the polish slavs whom they had enslaved and openly planned to exterminate	was a drastic operation but there was little doubt that it	was historically justified.	3.473965091661724
108. of more importance to	the west than poland's boundaries was the character of her government.	6.447041080440192
109. at yalta the west still believed that eastern europe could	be kept in its orbit in spite of the onrushing soviet armies.	4.190605837374976
110. though	little democracy had ever been practised in this region and much of	it was still ruled by feudalistic means it was taken for granted that	at least the forms of western democracy would be established in this	area and western capitalism preserved within it.	4.388429566727731
111. believing devoutly	as they did in anglo-saxon institutions it was important to both	roosevelt and churchill that the poles should have them.	3.7762720180850553
112. the	issue was acute because the exiled polish government in london supported	in the main by britain was still competing with the new lublin	government formed behind the red army.	4.853189606625967
113. more time was spent in	trying to marry these imcompatibles than over any subject discussed at	yalta.	4.334679032310181
114. the result was an agreement that the lublin government should	be reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion	of democratic leaders from poland itself and from the poles abroad	and pledged to hold free and unfettered elections as soon as possible	on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot.	4.788762122002942
115. all	democratic and anti-nazi parties were to have the right to campaign.	5.750897716875614
116. roosevelt acted as moderator of the long debate on this	issue.	6.629721630484475
117. it was a matter of principle with churchill since britain had	declared war in behalf of poland.	4.970015146107211
118. to stalin it was a matter of	life and death.	8.406585787899209
119. he made this completely clear.	6.670734761472009
120. speaking with great	earnestness he said: for the russian people the question	of poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security.	5.440873497327173
121. throughout history poland has been the corridor through which	the enemy has passed into russia.	4.804103478184731
122. twice in the last thirty years our	enemies the germans have passed through this corridor.	6.468540206943618
123. it is in	russia's interest that poland should be strong and powerful in a	position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force h.	3.5965617304200075
124. it	is necessary that poland should be free independent in power.	6.608766922138652
125. therefore	it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the	soviet state.	4.97088803437362
126. in other words the soviet union was determined	to create a poland so strong as to be a powerful bulwark against	germany and so closely tied to russia that there would never be any	question of her serving as a cordon sanitaire against the soviets	or posing as an independent balancing power in between russia and	germany.	5.170699419466916
127. byrnes says that invariably thereafter the soviets used	the same security argument to justify their course in poland.	3.685338251241182
128. this reasoning	was also as inevitable as anything could be.	6.311078758588274
129. any free elections	that were to be held in poland would have to produce a government	in which moscow had complete confidence and all pressure from the west	for free voting by anti-soviet elements in poland would be met	by	restrictions on voting by these elements.	3.8458164929289733
130. in even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of eastern	europe where the upper classes had generally collaborated with	the nazis even to the extent of sending millions of their peasants into	russia as a part of hitler's armies.	5.212905847362375
131. but at yalta the conflicting	expectations of east and west were merged into an agreement by	the big three to assist all liberated countries in europe to	create	democratic institutions of their own choice.	3.81970734357582
132. in any case where	in their judgment conditions require italics added they	would form interim governmental authorities broadly representative	of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the earliest	possible establishment through free elections of governments responsive	to the will of the people.	4.8261607865276686
133. other similar affirmations in the	declaration on liberated europe seemed to assure democratic institutions	on the western model.	3.9948190693439787
134. later it developed that the soviets had	a very different interpretation of democracy which will be discussed	later and their judgment never told them that the big three should	unite in establishing democratic conditions as we understand them	within their zone of influence.	4.6790577584577155
135. professor mcneill thinks that	at yalta stalin did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him	that he thought the exclusion of the anti-soviet voters from east	european	elections would not be greatly resented by his allies while	neither roosevelt nor churchill frankly faced the fact that in poland	at least genuinely free democratic elections would return governments	unfriendly to russia by any definition of international friendliness.	3.322608907931819
136. also war-time propaganda and cooperation had obscured	the differences between russian and western ideas of democracy	and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal formulae than to imperil	the military victories over germany and japan.	4.7465204145205915
137. the application	of these formulae could not please both sides for they really	attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable.	3.3564185518874785
138. while obliged	to concede governments in east europe allied with the soviet union	instead of opposed to it we thought we had preserved our social and	economic system in east europe.	4.935149634138471
139. this illusion was described	in a far-sighted editorial in the new york herald tribune on	march 5 1947 in connection with the submission of the satellite peace	treaties to the senate.	4.079866847499289
140. in doing so marshall and byrnes were asking	for the ratification of a grim lesson in the facts of international	life.	5.67181750128781
141. we had entertained exaggerated ideas about our victory	automatically establishing our system throughout the world.	4.452484454304041
142. we	were troubled about the fate of the baltic states.	6.605205962496428
143. yalta left us with	comforting illusions of a western capitalist-democratic political	economy reigning supreme up to the curzon line and the borders of bessarabia.	3.792269829959419
144. this is a penetrating description	of our post-war illusion which applied to other areas than east	europe.	6.1687638423222015
145. the same editorial continued that we expected to democratize	japan and korea and to see a new china pattern itself easily	on our institutions.	3.856825864248471
146. we expected in short that most of the world	would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple	from such a position to deal with the localized aberrations of	the soviet union.	6.268308997595511
147. yet actually the image corresponded in no	way to the actualities of the post-war world.	4.194504189836353
148. neither our military our	economic nor our ideological power reached far enough to determine	the fate of east europe.	5.460129634270805
149. then the editorial added prophetically:	how far they may reach in asia is yet undetermined but they fall	far short of our dreams of the war conferences.	3.933155361384108
150. here is	the best short explanation of the origins of the cold war that has been	written.	6.921653357442151
151. failing to heed the lesson so clearly contained in the satellite	treaties president truman re-declared the cold war on march	12 1947 in the truman doctrine exactly one week after the herald	tribune editorial was written and a year after the cold war	had been announced by churchill at fulton missouri in truman's	presence.	3.3803194868615023
152. then china promptly went communist and mr truman	had to fight the interminable korean war for the democratization of	korea before we learned how far our writ did reach in asia.	4.8435235798929845
153. years of war strain and hatred; of heavy arms expenditures	and constant danger of another world war had to ensue before the united	states could bring itself to accept the two chief results of world	a	while the cold war raged it was easy to blame	it all on yalta.	3.460830215203045
154. yet in summarizing a series of careful essays	on the yalta conference forrest pogue could find no basis for yalta	becoming a symbol for betrayal and a shibboleth for the opponents	of roosevelt and international cooperation.	5.025088814759163
155. when the yalta papers	were finally published with great fanfare they had revealed no betrayal	by anyone.	4.238485187375732
156. an analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts.	7.330636728805298
157. first	is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation planning	and discussion.	4.19597581016727
158. preparation began slightly more than a year after	independence with the first steps to organize rural communes.	6.7959399012383495
159. all	political interests supported electoral planning although there are some	signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to	some procrastination.	3.542415248362911
160. the second major aspect of the election is the	actual procedure of registration nomination and voting.	6.243216206863883
161. considerable	technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was	generally above reproach.	4.003916237538537
162. however the regionally differentiated results	which appear below in tables are interesting evidence of the problems	of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances.	5.5495073728834425
163. a third aspect and probably the one open to most controversy	is the results of the election.	4.351112817185648
164. the electoral procedure prevented	the ready identification of party affiliation but all vitally interested	parties including the government itself were busily engaged in	determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the	month following the elections.	4.249873750267645
165. the fourth and concluding point will	be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they	figure in the current pattern of internal politics.	3.6689834983711993
166. elections	have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official	address since independence.	5.583228874976599
167. they were stressed in the speeches	of si mubarak bekkai when the first council of ministers was formed	and again when the istiqlal took a leading role in the second council.	4.046094567425783
168. king muhammad 5 was known to be most sympathetic to the formation	of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections	on may day 1957.	4.818143647064429
169. there followed a long and sometimes bitter	discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 in	which it appears that the minister of the interior took the most pessimistic	view and that the istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic.	4.092745752283506
170. since the complicated process of establishing new communes and	reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the french did not even begin	until the fall of 1957 this goal appears somewhat ambitious.	5.450145325131285
171. from	the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues	in moroccan politics precisely the type of questions that were	most difficult to resolve in the new government.	3.953612823717899
172. until the charter	of liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 there were no guarantees	of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes.	6.490924793850724
173. the	istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 but the pdi	the most important minor	party at the time objected to the istiqlal's predominance in the	civil service and influence in radio maroc.	3.595275532714481
174. there were rumors that	the ministry of the interior favored an arbitrary non-political	process which were indirectly affirmed when the king personally intervened	in the planned meetings.	5.407550475989834
175. the day following his intervention	the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that h the	possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral	lists lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation	itself h would be supported by the king himself.	3.3774671557695997
176. the ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration	of elections but french consultants were called in and notices of further	investigation appeared from time to time.	4.829170651864624
177. in january 1958 the	minister of the interior announced that an election law was ready	to be submitted to the king the rumors of election dates appeared once	again first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer.	3.476769715428166
178. although	the government was probably prepared for elections by mid-1958 the	first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied.	5.11023169137075
179. in late 1957 the mp appeared	and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the istiqlal was	revealed when the third council of government under balafrej was formed	without support from progressive elements in the party.	3.380895750250915
180. the parties	were on the whole unprepared for elections while the people were	still experiencing post-independence let-down and suffering the after	effects of poor harvests in 1957.	4.679112530215941
181. despite the internal and international	crises that harassed morocco the elections remained a central	issue.	4.580155340471139
182. they figured prominently in the balafrej government of may	1958 which the king was reportedly determined to keep in office until	elections could be held.	4.9663518773793225
183. but the eagerly sought homogeneity	of the balafrej council of government was never achieved as the istiqlal	quarreled over foreign policy labor politics and economic development.	3.729152791361906
184. by december 1958 when 'abdallah ibrahim became president	of the council elections had even greater importance.	5.597798095886885
185. they were	increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural	communes as the focus of a new constructive national effort.	4.526767522521035
186. to minimize	the chances of repeating the balafrej debacle the ibrahim government	was formed a titre personnel and a special office was created	in the ministry of the interior to plan and to conduct the elections.	4.676690208989603
187. by this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete.	5.334743173853757
188. there remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws	through the labyrinth of palace politics and making a small number	of	policy decisions.	5.302124325379124
189. from the rather tortuous history of electoral	planning in morocco an important point emerges concerning the first	elections in a developing country and evaluating their results.	3.7040522439686554
190. in	the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving	fundamental and sometimes bitter differences among leaders and	also as a source of policy guidance.	5.568196817812747
191. in the absence of a reservoir	of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections	will give them new prominence but in a system where there is	as yet no place for the less prominent.	3.852195735870696
192. lacking the respected and effective	institutions that consensus helps provide minority parties such	as the pdi in 1957 and the progressive istiqlal faction	in 1958 clamor for elections when out of power but are not at all	certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power.	4.508907345099633
193. those	in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral	process.	4.322042075971935
194. the tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest	rather than an instrument of national interest had two important	effects	on electoral planning in morocco.	4.559643901163604
195. at the central level	the scrutin uninominal voting system was selected over some form	of the scrutin de liste system even though the latter had been	recommended by duverger and favored by all political parties.	3.590474225399411
196. the	choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent	by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas	of the country but it also served to minimize the national political	value of the elections.	4.860737997112023
197. although the elections were for local officials	it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties	from publicly identifying their candidates.	3.929803416872631
198. with multiple member	districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have	operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to	state their positions more clearly.	5.2431309179808965
199. both parties and the ministry of	the interior were busily at work after the elections trying to unearth	the political affiliations of the successful candidates and thereby	give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political	significance.	3.30289879509833
200. since a national interpretation cannot be avoided	it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize	party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation.	5.318224676499707
201. the general setting of the moroccan election may	also encourage the deterioration of local party organization.	3.8259737071378432
202. the concentration	of effective power in rabat leads not only to party bickering	but to distraction from local activity that might have had many	auxiliary benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections.	4.933302561407021
203. interesting evidence can be found in the results of the chamber	of commerce elections which took place three weeks before national	elections.	4.420821099766089
204. the istiqlal sponsored umcia	was opposed by candidates of the new unfp	in nearly all urban centers.	5.4878515433967205
205. as the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy	businessmen the umcia was generally favored	against the more progressive labor-based unfp the	newer party campaigned heavily while the older more confident party	expected the moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them	as they had done for many years.	3.2519826385476565
206. the local istiqlal and umcia	offices did not campaign and lost heavily.	5.6377271533649935
207. the	value of the elections was lost both as an experiment in increased political	participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest	as shown in table 1.	3.7298906200766213
208. the chamber of commerce elections	were of course an important event in the preparation for rural commune	elections.	5.445586260144781
209. the unfp learned that its urban organization	which depends heavily on umt support was most	effective.	3.570845587849075
210. the istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of	the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete	precise problems of internal politics.	4.982280406516479
211. the overall effect was probably	to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than	might have otherwise taken place.	3.390604280653994
212. a second major point of this	essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections.	5.960040375685448
213. although	a somewhat technical subject it has important political implications	as the above discussion of the voting system indicated.	3.8973573907533376
214. furthermore	the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of	the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential	to evaluating election results.	4.714137561967006
215. the sine qua non of the elections	was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure.	3.6311862882065773
216. as the	background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts	that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer	elections.	5.431491895059786
217. the pdi and later the popular movement protected	the istiqlal's privileged position until the fall of	balafrej and then the istiqlal used the same argument which it had	previously ignored against the pro-unfp tendencies	of the ibrahim government.	3.1882101489296923
218. the bulk of the preparation had	of course proceeded under the supervision of the ministry of the interior	whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally	disinterested in party politics.	4.544612843950507
219. apart from some areas of recurring	trouble like bani mellal where inexperienced officials had	been appointed there is little evidence that local officials intervened	in the electoral process.	3.853827847817343
220. centrally however the administrative	problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely	an unfair advantage.	4.985333447698777
221. the king decided to remove ibrahim a week	before elections and to institute a non-party council of government	under his personal direction.	3.480210741864673
222. although the monarch had frequently asserted	that the elections were to be without party significance his action	was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor.	5.455246718796068
223. the new council was itself inescapably of political meaning which	was most clearly revealed in the absence of any unfp	members and the presence of several istiqlal leaders.	4.004598422499361
224. since the	details of the elections were settled the change of government had no	direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections and may have	been	more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the unfp	voting preparations began in the fall of 1959	although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes	was completed in 1958.	4.7063215120181905
225. there were three major administrative tasks:	the fixing of electoral districts the registration of voters and the	registration of candidates.	4.097432609846484
226. voter registration began in late november	1959 and continued until early january 1960.	5.583228874976599
227. the government was	most anxious that there be a respectable response.	4.500595325776521
228. periodic bulletins	of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process	into a kind of competition among provincial officials.	5.530837681822505
229. a goal was fixed	as given in table 2 and attention focused on its fulfillment.	3.8552083837030713
230. the	qualifications to vote were kept very simple.	6.743273855772659
231. both men and women of	twenty-one years of age could register and vote upon presenting proof	of residence and identification.	4.6581538176021295
232. there were liberal provisions for	dispensation where documents or records were lacking.	6.766861229611759
233. the police were	disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens criminals	and those punished for protectorate activities.	3.5538565878471067
234. the	registration figures given in table 2 must be interpreted with caution	since the estimate for eligible electors were made without the benefit	of a reliable census.	4.67288338831304
235. unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment	in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to	secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future.	3.725031548341161
236. some	vocational training schools provide such training but the current	need exceeds the facilities.	5.583228874976599
237. the present federal	program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of	the smith-hughes act which provided a continuing annual appropriation	of $7 million to support on a matching basis state-administered	programs of vocational education in agriculture trades industrial skills	and home economics.	3.183359584403327
238. since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related	acts have extended this federal program.	6.160624020723899
239. the george-barden	act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to	$29 million in addition to the $7 million under the smith act.	3.6005982152205624
240. the	health amendment act of 1956 added $5 million for practical nurse	training.	5.739974350684024
241. the latest major change in this program was introduced	by the national defense education act of 1958 title 8 of	which amended the george-barden act.	3.446935224096163
242. annual authorizations of $15	million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national	defense needs for highly skilled technicians.	4.920292053327142
243. the federal	program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage	the establishment of vocational education programs in public	schools.	3.390604280653994
244. the initiative administration and control remain primarily	with the local school districts.	5.187607148293761
245. even the states remain primarily in	an assisting role providing leadership and teacher training.	4.639924566646665
246. federal	assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure and the	state or local districts must pay at least half.	5.898743997581227
247. the state may decide	to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost or the state	may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it.	3.6565040242837052
248. throughout the history of the program state government expenditures	in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the federal expenditures	while local districts all together have spent more than either	federal or state governments.	5.457640589706685
249. today federal funds account for only	one-fifth of the nation's expenditures for vocational education.	4.462753286808785
250. the	greatest impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially	encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough	to obtain their full allocation of outside funds.	4.857761785848409
251. national defense	considerations have been the major reason behind most federal	training expenditures in recent decades.	4.561193724903258
252. during world war 2 about	7.	13.65054877041678
253. 5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special	programs administered by state and local school authorities:	vocational education for national defense and war production	training.	3.7119863272622733
254. the total cost of the five-year program was $297 million.	6.720814983771225
255. for the smith-hughes george-barden and national defense	act of 1958 the cumulative total of federal expenditures in 42 years	was only about $740 million.	3.790447326087225
256. no comparable measures are available	of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education	training.	6.085218198508719
257. there are a great number and variety of private commercial	schools trade schools and technical schools.	4.993690537368663
258. in addition many large	corporations operate their own formal training programs.	7.008228401738214
259. a recent study	indicated that 85 per cent of the nation's largest corporations	conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and examinations.	4.297410484758242
260. most skilled industrial workers nevertheless still	acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions.	5.992846080830016
261. the national	manpower council of columbia university has estimated that	three out of five skilled workers and one out of five technicians have	not been formally trained.	3.3683386290603368
262. there is little doubt that the students	benefit from vocational education.	8.415367183314185
263. employers prefer to hire youth	with such training rather than those without and most graduates of	vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training.	3.5903032714849084
264. vocational	educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled	workers but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills.	4.920292053327142
265. in most states trade and industrial training is provided	in a minority of the high schools usually located in the larger cities.	4.108376364992266
266. in arkansas fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade	and industrial courses.	6.5353619199179915
267. in illinois about 13 per cent of the schools	have programs and in pennsylvania 11 per cent.	4.506357173763071
268. an important	recent trend is the development of area vocational schools.	7.5004634064910825
269. for	a number of years kentucky louisiana and several other states have	been building state-sponsored vocational education schools that serve	nearby school districts in several counties.	3.7213285079923515
270. these schools are intended	to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not	be possible for very small school districts.	5.100998208558647
271. transportation may be	provided from nearby school districts.	4.913686410369733
272. courses are provided mainly for	post high school day programs; but sometimes arrangements also are	made for high school students to attend and evening extension courses	also may be conducted.	4.729357744606884
273. the title 8 program of the national	defense education act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward	area schools.	3.8996828427233328
274. by 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states.	6.816229947470289
275. they were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor	surplus and in 10 of the minor areas.	4.06219750153821
276. an extension of this program into	relation to new	some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been	related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their	desire to attract new industry.	5.038401313576359
277. the major training need of a new	industrial plant is a short period of pre-employment training for a	large number of semi-skilled machine operators.	3.6742802690137903
278. a few key skilled workers	experienced in the company's type of work usually must be brought	in with the plant manager or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere.	4.9139353923108
279. a prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run	advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers	and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees.	3.741802439015321
280. the existence of a public school vocational training program in	trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled.	4.635523559756591
281. additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs	worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities staff	and program are in being.	3.485087186249889
282. thus besides the training provided to youth	in school the existence of the school program can have supplementary	benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development	efforts.	5.273322600037645
283. few states make effective use of their existing vocational	education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new	industry.	4.433478956781809
284. the opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their	vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis	to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that my be quickly	local focus	the major weakness of vocational training programs in	labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands.	4.060030996422544
285. this weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas for it is inherent	in the system of local school districts in this country.	3.8969912593137455
286. planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to	local employer needs for trained workers.	5.2288514545018705
287. all the manuals for setting	up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local	survey of skill needs of estimating the growth of local jobs	and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and	their content.	3.6513987231677674
288. furthermore there is a cautious conservatism	on the part of those making local skill surveys.	7.582124621064056
289. local jobs can be seen	and counted while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical.	4.091291534475905
290. while the u s department of labor has a	program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and	publishing current outlook statements there is little tangible evidence	that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum	planning.	5.78686700055555
291. the u s office of education continues to stress	local surveys rather than national surveys.	4.266603598154726
292. this procedure is	extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history	of declining employment.	5.409749138213424
293. elaborate studies have been made in labor	surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job	vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify	training programs for those skills.	3.7310717418829755
294. no effort is made in the same studies	to present information on regional or national demand trends in these	skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other	skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be	trained.	5.141194079897189
295. moreover the current information on what types of training	are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary.	4.043060205541776
296. there	simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that	are in demand and the types of training programs that are required	or most suitable.	4.913758046017612
297. much of the available information comes not from the	federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states.	4.311826953417619
298. state and local agencies in the vocational education	field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities.	5.6568038943405625
299. there is a need for an expanded federal effort to provide	research and information to help guide state education departments and	local school boards in existing programs.	3.7419729134707462
300. a related question	is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided.	5.889537703623522
301. there is little evidence that existing public or private training	programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in	their programs even though they must pay tuition receive no subsistence	payments and are not guaranteed a job.	3.581933677444636
302. however there always is	some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire	training.	6.281824412475591
303. again one major difficulty is the local focus.	5.370220174497099
304. a	training program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there	is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards	and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely	at jobs in the local community.	4.510705170216465
305. if there is adequate information on job	opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere many more workers can be	expected to respond.	4.309817517028579
306. another problem is who will pay for the training.	7.275514854123636
307. local school districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic	about vocational training.	4.449627750421631
308. programs usually are expanded only	when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand	it.	5.331440467598945
309. even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support	for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it.	3.8122236723442717
310. state	governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational	schools but their focus is still on area job opportunities.	5.294547894482347
311. only	the federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and	nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower	needs.	4.910361753243393
312. if only state funds were used to pay for the vocational	education it could be argued that the state should not have to	bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in	other states.	6.205724495120104
313. however if federal funds are used it would be entirely	appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere	as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment.	4.228910406886169
314. such training	would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find	jobs in other localities.	6.324894544060279
315. a further possibility is suggested	by the example of the g i bills and also by some recent trends	in attitudes toward improving college education: that is to provide	financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local	facilities are inadequate.	3.4833759970405844
316. this probably would require some support	for subsistence as well as for tuition but the total would be no	greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a youth	conservation corps.	5.350579735712684
317. a maximum of $600 per year per student would	enable many to take training away from home.	3.9792369999368558
318. a program of financial	assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest	in training highly skilled labor.	6.289191723790045
319. instead of being limited to the poor	training facilities in remote areas the student would be able to	move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training.	3.751675237567196
320. such	specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly	growing industries where the equipment and job experience exist	and	where the future employment opportunities are located.	4.95747141027252
321. this would heighten	possibilities for part-time cooperative on-the-job and extension	training.	5.225531241679765
322. personal financial assistance would enable more	emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual.	6.434205112203121
323. his aptitudes	and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper	training.	4.20107693337999
324. but briefly the topping configuration must be examined for its	inferences.	6.334848153716804
325. then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had	further forecasting significance.	5.712504441027075
326. and then the application of the	count rules to the width of the configuration give us an	intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline.	5.772393744176639
327. the very idea	of their being count rules implies that there is some sort of proportion	to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and	the extent of the breakaway movement.	4.13761728507211
328. this expectation	is what really sold point and figure.	6.600382403185883
329. but there is no positive	and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense.	5.676578036048896
330. experience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply and	in fine these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations	and intensities of events.	5.216831605140666
331. after all too much does not happen too	suddenly nor does very little take long.	4.4723127478752795
332. the advantages and disadvantages	of these two types of charting bar charting and point and	figure charting remain the subject of fairly good natured litigation	among their respective professional advocates with both methods enjoying	in common one irrevocable merit.	4.357950796207715
333. they are both trend-following	methods.	7.754302405830063
334. even if we strip their respective claims to the barest minimum	the odds still favor them both for the trend in effect is	always	more likely to continue than to reverse.	5.056892282673216
335. of course many	more things are charted besides prices.	5.590887228559538
336. the foregoing have been methods	of charting prices but now let us look at some of the other indices	that are customarily charted and which are looked to for their forecasting	abilities.	5.35352233063223
337. the search for forecasting	formulae is ceaseless.	5.207801824968706
338. correlations have been worked up between	the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price.	5.619116800304754
339. the theory	behind this is of course fundamentalist in character.	4.600841317301743
340. as the number	of reported freight car loadings increased this was taken to indicate	increased industrial activity and consequently increased stock earnings	implying fatter dividends and implying therefore increased stock	market prices.	5.101065706978097
341. we now know that things rarely ever work out in such	cut-and-dried fashion and that car loadings while perhaps interesting	enough are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn	before stock prices turn.	3.436882032761821
342. but the quest for such an index	goes on ceaselessly with all manner of investors and speculators participating	ranging from the sedate institutional type virtually to the	proverbial shoe-string operator all seeking doggedly studiously daily-	and often nightly- for the enchanting index that will foretell	the eternal secret: which way will the market move; up or down?	4.353668405847548
343. 	it recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of youth	a quest heavily invested in during the days of wooden ships.	3.670141054653541
344. just	as heavily invested are the endeavors of multitudes of modern men who	carry on the quest for the enchanting index.	5.065637486543854
345. much of this goes on in offices high up in wall street's lofty	wind-swept towers.	4.7820992650303165
346. there sit men who make moving averages of	weekly volume monthly averages of price-earnings ratios ratios of	the number of advances to the number of declines ratios of an individual	stock's performance to overall market performance ratios of rising	price volume to falling price volume odd-lot indices and what not.	4.659395549657308
347. they are concerned with all things traded in securities bonds cocao	coffee soybeans cotton tin oats etc.	4.217727441839349
348. and along	chicago's	west jackson boulevard la salle street and around the	merchandise mart plaza there sit men who chart crop reports who divide	the number of reported lady-bugs by the number of reported green-bugs	and the number of hogs by the amount of corn.	5.154555614675265
349. they plot the open	interest curves rainfall curves and they even divide democratic	congressmen by republican congressmen.	3.9789745378525514
350. all these things and countless	more enter into their calculations and yet the enchanting index remains	non-forthcoming.	6.421846509431838
351. not at any rate in the fuller sense of the word.	6.231603189980658
352. the markets are far too subtle and the last word in these	endeavors will doubtless never be written for the enchanting index	is about as nebulous as the fountain of youth.	4.4678884983710745
353. but whereas civilized	men no longer pursue the fountain they never abandoned their pursuit	of the enchanting index.	3.9238037088949635
354. we mentioned odd-lot indices a	few paragraphs ago.	7.543900632520252
355. in the stock market the normal trading package	is a hundred shares just as 5000 bushels is the standard grain contract	package.	3.9189336390462746
356. a stock transaction for less than a hundred shares is executed	via a special odd-lot broker on the floor of the exchange.	5.923762443757531
357. this	results in a separate record being made distinguishing these trades	from the overall volume of trading.	3.8101576301595865
358. according to the theory underlying	odd-lot indices the trader who trades odd lots is most likely	a small trader one who can't afford to trade round lots.	5.232830725713063
359. or to	use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index enthusiast they represent	a sampling of the least sophisticated echelon of traders.	3.940727059548558
360. falling	most easily prey to an adverse market movement for this rank of traders	can least afford to lose virtually anything the odd-lot traders	do marketwise is taken to exemplify the wrong thing to do.	4.455517956252607
361. figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales	are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers.	3.9807324206702828
362. odd-lot index observers then make graphs of the data according to their	particular statistical recipe.	5.446094823016804
363. they might for example plot it exactly	as is or they might make ten day moving averages of it or longer	moving averages or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases	to odd-lot sales.	3.3628282006882118
364. the particular recipe is a matter of individual	taste.	6.939612301857323
365. the data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price	chart usually of a popular stock average.	3.6038685368841428
366. towards the end of	an intermediate or major rise while the top is forming on the price	chart it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply.	4.599533526873035
367. this warns the chartist that the formation in progress is quite	likely to be a top.	4.398628955312063
368. similarly at the opposite end of the market cycle	towards the end of an intermediate or major decline usually while	the bottom is being formed on the price chart it is characteristic	that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again alerting the chartist	that a bottom is becoming a greater likelihood.	4.896102335416354
369. thus in the aggregate	the odd-lot trader is one who buys at the tops and sells at the	bottoms notwithstanding occasional individual exceptions.	4.070856021182207
370. while	it had long been known in general that the public is always wrong	the use of odd-lot indices now puts the adage on a statistical	basis.	5.0388513892500075
371. one might well wonder why the public is always wrong	and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned	with the chicken and the egg.	3.9671942126373083
372. which came first?	11.531064082081388
373.  is it really that	the public buys at the tops and not that the market tops out when	the public buys?	4.266510095296347
374.  and the converse at bottoms.	9.78547790066648
375. does the public	usually sell at bottoms or does the market usually bottom	out when the public sells?	4.482388423115394
376.    we have been using the word	public in quotation marks that is in its vernacular connotation	with reference to the odd-lot index theory.	6.285622229716617
377. obviously someone has	to sell in order for someone to buy and vice versa.	4.388608259769008
378. and while all concerned	are members of the literal public somewhat less than all concerned	although still a majority form the quotation marked public.	5.716270205421217
379. and the public minus the public leaves the so-called sophisticated	element- the element on the other end of the public's	transactions.	5.202053199399668
380. this element is often called strong	hands.	7.416165143643923
381. strong hands differ from weak hands in that their operations	are the primary movers.	4.002512203722013
382. they initiate campaigns so to speak	even if this initiation is diffused among them and their concerted action	only psychologically organized.	5.329689574510152
383. strong hands act; weak hands	react.	5.7063434737490555
384. strong hands move first; weak hands ask what is going on?	6.036058680138402
385. 	when strong hands buy they are able to buy more and they do it even	in the face of bearish news reports.	4.110740672039702
386. they are able to sit more patiently	with what they have bought.	8.032275528265169
387. needless to say strong hands are	not eager to be joined by weak hands for this increases the risk that	they will have to absorb what these weak hands unload on the way up	at higher prices during the run-up phase of the campaign.	3.583728139279255
388. certain	badly disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel that there	is something somehow unfair dirty or even thoroughly criminal about	this interplay of competitive forces.	4.907506627217674
389. but after all can anyone imagine	a market wherein the reverse of these things were true?	4.379431249865706
390.  try to	imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose and	the majority would make consistent profits.	5.2044199241316
391. how much and how many profits	could a majority take out of the losses of a few?	5.100207855995256
392.    moreover	the taunt concerning the sophisticated echelon and its alleged	erudition is put to test during every campaign and accrues only	upon results; not before.	4.758972536424235
393. it quite often happens that campaigns go	askew resulting in a most unflattering deterioration of strong hands	into played-out hands just as a member of a former campaign's public	may emerge flatteringly right the next time.	3.6815907879437644
394. membership	in the echelons fluctuates too.	7.712079578137997
395. the study of odd-lot indices	is somehow akin to the spectacle of a man trying to outfox his own shadow	what with all observers trying to get on the side of the few	at the same time.	4.200398513127304
396. the usefulness of this study and of configuration	analysis as well declines in direct proportion to the dissemination	of its use.	4.932182136842558
397. it has to by virtue of the very dictionary definition of	the word few.	5.969233955296898
398. diametric opposition must persist as to	the future course of prices if there is to persist a market at all.	5.420407333233228
399. and	the few must win what the many lose for the opposite arrangement	would not support markets as we know them at all and is in fact unimaginable.	3.9897881338633066
400. there need be no squeamishness about admitting this.	7.862184142323762
401. anyone	still doubting that this is the only way markets can be is invited	to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently wins what	the minority loses.	4.373109022992968
402. mr john magee whose work has been discussed	in this chapter was quoted in a new yorker magazine profile	as saying- h of course you have to remember it's a good thing	for us chartists that there aren't more of us.	4.89483931067998
403. if you got too	many people investing by this method their operations would begin to	affect stock prices and thus throw the charts off.	3.8140593684410744
404. the method would	become self-defeating.	7.404920872018028
405. mr alexander h wheelan's	study helps in point and figure technique tells the readers- we	assure you that the total number of people using this method of	market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating	in the securities and commodities markets.	3.590026073824248
406. what with	traders trading for so many different objectives and what with there	being so many unique and individualized market theories and trading	techniques in use and more coming into use all the time it is hard to	imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough	fans to invalidate itself.	4.7071046390020275
407. nevertheless all theories and techniques	lead but to one of two possible modes of expression if they lead	to a market committment at all.	4.1060489602783825
408. in the final analysis then the user	becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance notwithstanding	any amount of forethought and calculation however elaborate.	5.302769022962288
409. thus	while his theory or technique may not be oversubscribed it is commonplace	for bullish and bearish positions to become temporarily over-subscribed.	3.8567855541504255
410. though the methods of deciding may be profound and diverse the	possible conclusions remain but two.	6.300711140051437
411. the purpose set forth at the beginning of this book	was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge	of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods already	in use so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself	the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that	is to follow and to appraise the forecast that its interpretation suggests	for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead.	3.3278429588312926
412. in assessing the outlook for interest rates in 1961 the	question as always is the prospect for general business activity.	5.251016577339133
413. by	and large what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship	between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and	will thus determine interest rates.	3.490185768259953
414. moreover the trend of general business	activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal monetary	and other federal policies which affect interest rates.	5.18037293804888
415. nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business	activity.	4.767544716573629
416. during much of the year the general level of business	activity has moved along on a record-high plateau but there have been	persistent signs of slack in the economy.	5.927228255573177
417. the tendency for general	business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident.	3.9732162489313065
418. although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year	has thus far been quite modest it is hard to escape the conclusion	that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961	and possibly somewhat longer.	5.088773061920404
419. it is difficult to see any powerful	sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the	economy a new upward thrust.	4.211073299369912
420. the rate of plant and equipment spending	by business and industry now seems to be topping out and facing some	decline.	5.5687435108115615
421. in earlier business cycles when this occurred the country usually	experienced a sharp upturn in residential construction as mortgage	financing became easier to obtain.	3.557967197764811
422. at this time however there are	signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with	the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction.	5.38516405861858
423. these signs are the inventories of unsold houses in some areas of	the country and the moderate rise in vacancy rates for apartments	.	3.921286786784935
424. on the other hand in a more favorable vein general	business activity should receive some stimulus from rising federal	spending and the reduction in business inventories has probably	run a good part of its course.	5.233684299197286
425. the 2% increase in retail sales in october	to a 4-month high is encouraging in this connection as well	as the most recent consumer survey by the national industrial conference	board which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans.	3.1831803640434604
426. the pattern of general business activity which probably lies	ahead of us is a further moderate softening through the spring of 1961	before a new rise in economic activity gets under way.	4.7738884004735365
427. the recovery	will probably be sparked by a rising rate of housing starts next spring	in response to more readily available mortgage credit as well as by	an expansion of government spending well sustained consumer spending	and some rebuilding of business inventories.	3.2464295484529933
428. what does the general business outlook suggest about the trend	of long-term rates in 1961?	6.149202691808189
429.  it suggests that during the next several	months through the spring of 1961 the demand for long-term capital	funds may be moderately lower and that interest rates may tend to	move a little lower especially the rates on federal state and local	bonds as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds.	3.528261240289257
430. however	as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present as well	as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by voters the	over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high so that	any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great.	4.406793567695426
431. it seems likely	moreover that with an increase in the rate of	saving in mortgage lending institutions interest rates on residential	mortgages may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year although	the increased ease in residential mortgage lending may occur primarily	in other terms than interest rate eg easier downpayment	and amortization terms.	3.4202185291514207
432. if the trend of general business activity	follows the pattern suggested here we are likely to see additional	steps by the federal reserve authorities to ease the availability	of credit.	5.37129517778059
433. certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would	be a strong possibility as well as an easier reserve position for the	banking system.	4.241741298915615
434. however the monetary authorities will continue to	be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with	respect to our international balance of payments position and the outflow	of gold as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive	liquidity in the economy which would delay the effectiveness of	monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle.	5.126708105391963
435. one of the most intriguing questions is	whether the recent departures of the federal reserve authorities from	confining their open market operations to treasury bills will spread	into longer-term government securities in the next few months.	4.068430679375917
436. to	the extent that the new administration has its wishes the federal	reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire	maturity range of government securities and aggressively seek to force	down long-term interest rates.	4.834139786037941
437. the principle of bills only	or bills preferably seems so strongly accepted by the federal	reserve that it is difficult to envision conditions which would persuade	the authorities to depart radically from it by extending their open	market purchases regularly into long-term government securities.	3.5707270288997632
438. however to the extent that the monetary authorities in their effort	to ease credit in the next several months conduct their open market	operations in longer-term government bonds they will certainly act to	accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result	of market forces.	4.688028456888089
439. by the end of the spring of 1961 assuming	that a general business recovery gets under way interest rates should	begin to edge upward again depending upon the vigor of the recovery	and the determination with which the monetary authorities move to	restrain credit availability.	3.7849937459691647
440. my guess would be that interest rates will	decline moderately into the spring of 1961 and during the second half	of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during	the downturn.	5.087904034168419
441. it is pertinent to ask the question: has the	long upswing of interest rates during the past 15 years just about	run its course and are we now entering a period in which both capital	market forces and federal policies will produce a prolonged decline	of interest rates?	3.313199427112101
442.  my answer is in the negative because i believe	that total capital demands during the sixties will continue to press	against available supplies and interest rates will generally tend to	be firm at high levels.	5.186818711812079
443. this view is based upon	several basic economic forces which i believe will be operating in	recent events in the general	assembly of the united nations confirm that the cold war will remain	with us and probably intensify for the foreseeable future.	3.7140787409921563
444. this makes	it certain that federal expenditures for military preparedness and	foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several	years.	5.660016995479239
445. we are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the	friendship of the new african nations against the ruthless competition	of the communist bloc.	4.209209758639952
446. our efforts to overcome the lead of the	russians in space are bound to mean accelerated federal spending.	5.403208838090342
447. moreover	it is likely that federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster	rate of economic growth of the country to keep ahead of the communist	countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better	than theirs will lead to rising federal spending in certain areas	such as education housing medical aid and the like.	3.4303382176164336
448. there are	serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising federal expenditures	of which i take a dim view but it seems very likely to occur.	5.419420918224052
449. during the sixties we have the prospect of a significant stepping	up in the rate of household formations which should contribute	to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building.	4.160340311442071
450. according	to the latest	projections of the bureau of the census the annual	rate of household formations will increase for the next 20 years.	5.4702297739599715
451. under	the most favorable assumptions for increase the bureau of the	census projects that the annual rate of household formations will rise	from about 883000 in the last two years of the fifties to an annual	rate of about 1018000 in the first five years of the sixties and	to a slightly higher annual rate of 1083000 in the second half of the	decade.	3.8841105046043203
452. during the seventies the projections show a more pronounced	rise to an annual rate of 1338000 in the second half of that decade.	5.963233093261874
453. accordingly the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing	occasioned by the higher rate of household formation should enhance the	general economic prospects of the sixties.	3.5409084916318823
454. however the impact of	a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated.	6.579902572786922
455. the average annual rate of 1083000 in the second half of the	sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of 1525000 in	with	the expansion of family formation in the sixties a continued substantial	rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems	to be indicated.	3.4332914481286374
456. this is an area in which there is still a large backlog	of demand.	10.456716470241068
457. state and local expenditures increased	persistently from $26.	6.195646017120198
458. 5-billion in 1949 to $44.	7.712079578137997
459. 3-billion in 1959 and	it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this	decade which would carry them to the neighborhood of $75-billion	by 1970.	3.7759232213745477
460. here would be a powerful force for raising business activity.	7.930691464289216
461. the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures	should continue to move upward from the levels of the fifties.	3.693108762912197
462. spurred	by keen competition in our industrial system and still further	increases in the funds devoted to industrial research plant and equipment	expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade.	4.570175643364025
463. i suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and housing	which was dammed-up during the thirties and world war 2 is finally	in the process of running dry.	4.014008071438259
464. there is some clear-cut evidence	of this.	10.312843740524752
465. for example the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans	for housing under the va home loan guaranty program seems to have	largely exhausted itself.	4.1937150449476865
466. indeed the failure of home-building as a	whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage	financing and the increasing reports of pockets of unsold homes and	rising vacancy rates in apartment buildings may also signal in part	that the lush days of big backlog demand for housing are reaching an	end.	4.358366031852768
467. in a way we may be witnessing the same thing in the sales of automobiles	today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car	coming on the market but is more insistent on compact cars free of	the frills which were accepted in the fifties.	3.7602418224143057
468. the huge backlog of demand	which was evident in the first decade and a half after the war	was fed by liquid assets accumulated by the public during the war and	even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and	home loan fields.	4.7428539996821
469. the consuming public has used up a good part of these	liquid assets or they have been drained by the rising price level	and we have apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer	or home mortgage terms easier.	3.4773461802009047
470. this is not to say that the level	of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the sixties.	7.658029623249857
471. i	am confident that it will but consumer spending in the sixties will	not be fortified by the great backlog of wants and desires which characterized	most of the fifties.	3.9384349159545233
472. markets should become more competitive	as consumers become more selective.	6.144814417540349
473. accordingly during the sixties our national economy is likely	to grow at as fast a rate as in the fifties and in the process to	require enormous amounts of capital funds.	4.2845896927232205
474. wage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of	forces- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases.	5.8574746225851895
475. the purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which	has not been treated in the literature but which we believe makes a	significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few	very important industries.	3.2059440326345108
476. while there may be several such industries	to which the model of this paper is applicable the authors make particular	claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages	and prices in the steel industry of the united states since world	war 2.	5.380464941759347
477. indeed the apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude	in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the	model here presented.	4.190282753818851
478. the model of this paper considers an industry	which is not characterized by vigorous price competition but	which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous	critical public scrutiny.	4.333984489272324
479. where the industry's product price	has been kept below the profit-maximizing and entry-limiting	prices due to fears of public reaction the profit seeking producers	have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands.	3.598644525956892
480. the contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition	and an exploration of some of its implications.	5.312823640646816
481. in order	to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force which we may call	the effect of public-limit pricing on key wage bargains	we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces	such as union power which may be relevant in an actual situation.	3.4012183419127346
482. for	expository purposes this is best treated as a model which spells	out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the	public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence	of union pressures for higher wages.	4.5406275948164785
483. part 1 below describes	this abstract model by spelling out its assumptions.	4.730757209271838
484. part 2	discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant	conclusions.	7.79015360085262
485. part 3 discusses the empirical relevance and policy	implications of the conclusions.	4.730757209271838
486. part 4 is a brief summary.	8.616526306031068
487. the	mathematical appendix presents the rigorous argument but is best read	after part 1 in order that the assumptions underlying the equations	may be explicit.	3.5897850966185216
488. the industry with which this model is concerned is a	basic industry producing a substantial share of gross national product.	4.752766788189815
489. for the purposes of setting the product	price the industry behaves as a single entity.	4.417692104416357
490. the demand	we are concerned with aggregate	demand for the industry's product.	5.528041676786722
491. the manner in which this is shared	among firms is taken as given.	4.071758353032439
492. in any given time period the aggregate	demand for the industry's product is determined by two things:	the price charged by the industry and the level of gnp.	5.357402541994845
493. for	the purposes of this discussion the problem of relative prices is encompassed	in these two variables since gnp includes other prices.	4.025168982617261
494. the form of	the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary	inversely with the product price and vary directly with the level of	gnp.	4.748582226230526
495. the industry of	this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected	with a public interest.	3.472942664760073
496. because of its importance and because the	lack of price competition is well recognized the industry is under considerable	public pressure not to raise its price any more than could	be justified by cost increases.	5.2380255933517
497. the threat of effective anti-trust action	provoked by gouging the public through price increases not	justified by cost increases and fears of endangering relations with	customers congress the general public and the press all operate	to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases.	3.2127048763523027
498. for the	industry of this model the effect of such public pressures in the	past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit-maximizing	price and even	below the entry-limited price.	5.381561057601588
499. for	such an industry it is only safe to raise its price if such an	increase is manifestly justified by rising costs	.	3.829992229485786
500. thus if public pressure sets the effective limit to	the price that the industry may charge this pressure is itself a function	of the wage rate.	5.128338235875805
501. in this model we abstract from all non-wage	sources of cost changes so that the public-limit price only	rises as the wage rate rises.	4.109977887503641
502. in such circumstances it may well be	to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage	rate.	6.460230183527488
503. since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises the	profit-maximizing price also rises when the public-limit price is elevated	and is likely to remain well above the latter.	3.7684889481532373
504. the entry-limiting	price will also be raised for potential domestic competition but	unless general inflation permits profit margins to increase proportionately	throughout the economy we might expect the public-limit price	to approach the entry-limit price.	4.397080562342301
505. the foreign-entry-limit price would	be approached more rapidly since domestic wage-rates do not enter foreign	costs directly.	3.5177069743400518
506. where this approach becomes critical the industry	can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its	sincerity in resisting the wage pressures of a powerful union	requesting	tariff relief after it has reluctantly acceded to the union	pressure.	4.99393211375405
507. whether or not it is in the industry's interest	to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent	to which the public-limit price rises in response to a basic wage	increase and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying	the wage increase.	3.926913482044453
508. the extent to which the public-limit price	is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a	function of three things: the passage of time the level of gnp	and the size of the wage increase.	5.313228744653229
509. we are abstracting from	the fact of strikes here but it should be obvious that the extent to	which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic	wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the	industry.	3.8457569107479515
510. the industry may deliberately take a strike not to put pressure	on the union but in order to educate the government and	the customers of the industry.	4.88420819875182
511. as a strike continues these parties increase	their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement.	4.630626685921062
512. they become	increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry	claims the wage bargain would entail.	5.714456664756434
513. public indignation and	resistance to wage-price increases is obviously much less when the increases	are on the order of 3% per annum than when the increases are	on the order of 3% per month.	3.90815465809912
514. the simple passage of an additional	eleven months' time makes the second 3% boost more acceptable.	5.186867258675562
515. thus	the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage increase	the longer it has been since the previous price increase.	3.9537740737274314
516. notice however	that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices	per se without an accompanying wage increase.	5.334927197147896
517. similarly higher	levels of gnp do not in themselves provide grounds for raising	prices but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that	it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase.	3.997416937778855
518. this is not	extended to anticipated levels of gnp however- only the current	level of gnp affects the public pressure against wage-price increases.	5.255875587151782
519. finally since the public requires some restraint on the part	of the companies larger wage increases call for less than proportionately	larger price increases	a price increase of 7% a wage increase of 10% allows a price	.	3.378516773404217
520. we	assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation	is constant with respect to quantity produced		and is the same for every firm.	5.209543403783853
521. the level of this average cost is determined by factor prices technology	and so forth.	3.9509645036783874
522. as we have noted however we are abstracting	from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in	the wage rate.	5.6116867155296095
523. the level of average cost is	e.	5.1544066959273
524. union policies and collective	the single union which faces the industry	does not restrict its membership and there is an adequate supply	of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate.	5.1497063081435135
525. the union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter	of concern when setting its own wage policy- its concern with employment	makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain	full employment.	3.3458163105319465
526. the union vigorously demands wage increases from	productivity increases and wage increases to offset cost-of-living	increases but we abstract from these forces here.	4.622402445125504
527. for our present	purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage	rate	and it is this basic wage rate which determines the	level of costs.	4.041231941317709
528. productivity is something of an amorphous concept and	the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even	well known to the industry much less to the union or to the public.	4.895532549773249
529. disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the	problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a productivity	increase should be shared.	3.959645753890781
530. the existence of conflict and of	vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict	the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living	and productivity-share increases as distinct from a cost-raising increase	in the basic wage rate.	4.639959013898422
531. we assume further that the union	recognizes the possibility that price-level increases may offset wage-rate	increases and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price	increases arising from its own wage increases upon the real	wage rate.	3.629367053157171
532. for internal political reasons the union asks for	increases in the basic wage rate and would vigorously oppose	a reduction in this rate but the adjustment of the basic wage rate	upwards is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry.	4.915377680902236
533. changes in the basic wage rate are cost-raising and	they constitute an argument for raising prices.	4.054085512656634
534. however it is not known	to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase	is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate although the	companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude.	5.2920829918176135
535. in this model then the industry is presumed to realize that	they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate but since	such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may	in circumstances to be spelled out in part 2 below find it to	their advantage to allow the wage rise.	3.4917009661888128
536. thus for non-negative changes	in the basic wage rate the industry becomes the active wage-setter	since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason	of industry acquiescence.	4.939724460117892
537. the presumption in the literature would appear	to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case on	the grounds that it is clearly not in the interest of the industry	to raise wages gratuitously.	3.9252895769901452
538. from this presumption it is an easy	step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate	must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed	in our model.	5.209421070314933
539. it is this conclusion that we challenge; we do	so by disproving the presumption on which it is based.	4.316217466264163
540. of the model	it is convenient to assume that the union-industry	contract is of one year's duration.	6.5102096068045165
541. in the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international	law.	4.820012822218869
542. several factors contributed to this change.	8.301973629519528
543. the	congress of vienna is a convenient starting point because it both	epitomized and symbolized what was to follow.	3.685338251241182
544. here in 1815 the great	nations assembled to legislate not merely for europe but for the world.	6.59183070651655
545. thus the congress marks a formal recognition of the political system	that was central to world politics for a century.	4.484634641195861
546. international	law had to fit the conditions of europe and nothing that could not	fit this	system or the interests of the great european nations collectively	could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense.	5.33846411766684
547. essentially	this imposed two conditions: first international law had to recognize	and be compatible with an international political system in which	a number of states were competitive suspicious and opportunistic	in their political alignments with one another; second it had to	be compatible with the value system that they shared.	3.1358859514638224
548. in both respects	international law was europeanized.	8.553521669241539
549. it was not always easy	to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions.	4.496113426391359
550. on the one hand the major european nations had to maintain vis-a-vis	each other an emphasis upon sovereignty independence formal equality-	thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of	action to maintain the flexibility of alignment that the system	required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous	napoleonic experience.	4.755837387701295
551. but there was no pressing need to maintain	these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world.	5.711405053655664
552. thus theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the	smaller european states did not really comfortably fit less developed	and less powerful societies elsewhere.	4.938643289620986
553. political interference in africa	and asia and even in latin america	by the special interest of the united states as expressed in	the monroe doctrine itself from the outset related to european politics	was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values	and the european balance itself.	3.8054938341219815
554. a nation such as switzerland	could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect	its neutrality; more doubtful but possible	was the neutralization of the latin american countries;	out of the question was the neutralization of asia and africa.	4.522818580816393
555. this europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of	19th century scholars.	4.378819342529718
556. more emphasis was put upon the fact that international	law was the law of civilized nations; kent and story	the great early american scholars repeatedly made use of this phrase	or of christian nations which is a substantial equivalent.	5.625529913109599
557. wheaton stated that the public law was essentially limited to the	civilized and christian peoples of europe or to those of european	origin.	3.7930834931950743
558. of course it had always been of european origin in fact	but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory.	5.511847181619461
559. now with virtually every writer not only was the european origin	of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon but the rules	thus established by the advanced civilizations of europe were to be imposed	on others.	3.7118492467487645
560. the european customs on which international law was	based were to become by force and fiat the customs that others were	to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states.	4.548214883233395
561. hall for example was quite explicit on this point when he said	states outside european civilization must formally enter into the	circle of law-governed countries.	3.4877187872082875
562. they must do something with the	acquiescence of the latter or some of them which amounts to an acceptance	of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction.	5.532530652877784
563. during the nineteenth century these views were protested by	virtually all the latin american writers though ineffectively just	as the new nations of africa and asia protest them with more effect	today.	3.760158754478041
564. a number of other nineteenth-century developments	contributed	to the transmutation of the law of nations into international	law; that is from aspects of a universal system of justice into	particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states.	5.385251053823892
565. the difference	is important for although the older law of nations did cover	relationships among sovereigns this was by no means its exclusive domain.	3.523597605858551
566. the law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to	their own citizens to foreigners and to each other in a conceptually	unified system.	5.679315683725148
567. the theory of international law which in the nineteenth	century became common to virtually all writers in europe and america	broke this unity and this universality.	3.665844941046398
568. it lost sight of the	individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise	of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice	or morality save as these values might affect international relations.	4.691986025180874
569. no longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine	what he ought to do; his search was merely for rules that might limit	his freedom of action.	3.7658242347199518
570. to appreciate this development we	must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy.	5.940836276549104
571. first	and most obvious was the growing nationalism and the tendency to	regard the state and the individual's identification with the state	as transcending other ties of social solidarity.	3.6444155401495633
572. national identification	was not new but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout	europe as new unifications occurred.	5.772687457226841
573. it reached its ultimate	philosophical statement in notions of state will put forward by	the germans especially by hegel although political philosophers will	recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of hobbes.	3.446454264563289
574. national	identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law theories which	incorporated this hegelian abstraction and saw law domestic and international	simply as its formal reflection.	4.807873378411027
575. in the international community	this reduced law to jellinek's auto-limitation.	4.892339385020207
576. a state the	highest form of human organization in fact and theory could be subjected	to law only by a manifestation of self-will or consent.	4.842268038825358
577. according	to the new theories the nineteenth century corporate sovereign	was sovereign in a quite new and different sense from his historical	predecessors.	4.063640474866013
578. he no longer sought to find the law; he made it;	he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be.	5.471767802329705
579. there was	no law domestic or international except that willed by acknowledged	by or consented to by states.	4.231259062866871
580. hidden behind hegelian abstractions	were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence.	5.739974350684024
581. related	to but distinguishable from nationalism was the growth of democracy	in one form or another.	4.242499621235062
582. increased participation in politics and	the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic	effects upon law institutions.	4.985333447698777
583. the efforts of various interest groups	to control or influence governmental decisions particularly when	taken in conjunction with the impact of industralization led to a concentration	of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby	policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions.	3.464885080785535
584. law became a conscious process something more than simply	doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for	applicable norms.	4.922246018558126
585. particularly was this true when the norms previously	applied were no longer satisfactory to many when customs were rapidly	changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed.	3.703393067325627
586. the	old way of doing things which depended on a relatively stable community	with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations was no longer	adequate to the task.	4.67288338831304
587. first was the period of codification of existing	law: the code napoleon in france and the peculiar codification	that in fact resulted from austin's restatement and ordering of	the common law in england.	3.8199507914765425
588. codification was followed in all countries	by a growing amount of legislation some changing and adjusting	the older law much dealing with entirely new situations.	4.714137561967006
589. the legislative	mills have been grinding ever since and when its cumbersome processes	were no longer adequate to the task a limited legislative authority	was delegated in one form or another to the executive.	3.1094247477676515
590. whereas	the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice the	nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied	with law.	5.269387214575266
591. indeed with developed positivism the separation of law	from justice or from morality generally became quite specific.	4.0505126840557315
592. in municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as	fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power	of parliament- the elected representatives- at the expense of the	more conservative judiciary.	4.891375047583367
593. when the power of the latter was made	both limited and explicit- when norms were clarified and made more precise	and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary	hands- two purposes were served: government was made subservient	to an institutionalized popular will and law became a rational	system for implementing that will for serving conscious goals for embodying	the public policy.	3.4169740364609518
594. it is true that initially the task	was to remove restrictions that it was thought inhibited the free	flow of money goods and labor; but even laissez-faire was a conscious	policy.	5.3172230749036515
595. law was seen as an emanation of the sovereign will.	4.531460226482497
596. however the sovereign was not hobbes' absolute monarch but rather	the parliamentary sovereign of austin.	6.108621074949948
597. it was too an optimistic	philosophy and though it separated law from morality it was by no means	an immoral or amoral one.	3.788220250984417
598. man through democratic institutions	of government and economic freedom was master of his destiny.	5.998790765586534
599. the theory	did not require though it unfortunately might acquire a hegelian	mystique.	3.78019698820429
600. it was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions	of popular government.	6.173726130157382
601. it was not opposed to either justice	or morality; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials	who wielded public authority.	4.039111769170015
602. particularly was this true as	laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of western society.	5.448482501884564
603. to free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising	bourgeoisie and this objective required that governmental authority-	administrative officials and judges- be limited as precisely	and explicitly as possible; that old customs which inhibited trade be	abrogated; that business be free from governmental supervision and	notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the	free market; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with	the new politics and the new economics be done away with.	3.090789269851178
604. contract-	conceived as the free bargain of formal equals- replaced the implied	obligations of a more static and status-conscious society.	5.352331914614598
605. indeed	contract was the dominant legal theme of the century the touchstone	of the free society.	4.453219097301971
606. government itself was based upon contract; business	organization- the corporation- was analyzed in contractual terms;	trade was based on freedom of contract and money was lent and	borrowed on contractual terms; even marriage and the family was seen	as a contractual arrangement.	4.6486110523771655
607. it is not surprising that the international	obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract.	4.8777324235754
608. in	fact some- anzilotti is the principle example- went so far as	to say that all international law could be traced to the single legal	norm pacta sunt servanda.	4.986057811147976
609. the displacement	of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth	and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international law	theory and doctrine.	3.390604280653994
610. in the first place the new doctrine brought	a	formal separation of international from municipal law rejecting the earlier	view that both were parts of a universal legal system.	5.269690401758601
611. one result	was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations.	5.41331310608386
612. admiralty law the law merchant and the host of problems which arise	in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country	were all severed from the older law of nations and made dependent	on the several national laws.	4.482856086898813
613. private international law	was thus segregated from international	law proper or as it is often called public international law.	4.5191487758843065
614. states were free to enact within broad though determinate	limits their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their	courts to vary the law merchant and to enact legislation with regard	to many claims arising on the high seas.	4.727355922397332
615. the change was not quite	so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be	invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation	and then largely in marginal situations.	3.1388440935536464
616. mr justice black was one of the minority that rested on the article	1 power.	6.798389173279964
617. in this view supported by only three members of the	court a power denied by the specific provisions of article 3	was granted by the generality of article 1.	3.685832696989906
618. if this seems arbitrary	its effect was to treat citizens of the district of columbia equally	with citizens of the states- at the expense of expanding a troublesome	jurisdiction.	5.5473262589225705
619. for almost	a hundred years we relied upon state courts	for the protection of most rights arising under national	law.	3.8719644363482564
620. then in 1875 apparently in response to the nationalizing	influence of the civil war congress first gave the lower federal courts	general authority- concurrently with state tribunals- to decide	cases involving federal-right questions.	5.378977482332136
621. one purpose of the change	was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the civil	war amendments against state interference.	4.004373041610021
622. serious difficulty arose	with the advent of substantive due process.	6.468577852425639
623. an amendment presumably	designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves became	a laissez-faire limitation upon state economic policy.	4.4341303785436015
624. a flood	of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the processes of	local government.	5.535226767350575
625. congress reacted with a series of measures modifying	in various ways what it had granted in 1875.	4.410088766172394
626. in 1910 it required the	convening of a special three-judge court for the issuance of certain	injunctions and allowed direct appeals to the supreme court.	5.27246580695102
627. such	legislation was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter.	4.897882050461599
628. in 1913 an abortive provision was made for the stay of federal injunction	proceedings upon institution of state court test cases.	5.3144085177430815
629. the essential	ineffectiveness of these measures resulted in 1934 in substantial	elimination of federal jurisdiction to enjoin state public utility rate	orders.	3.3564185518874785
630. three years later similar restraints were imposed upon injunctions	against collection of state taxes.	6.141906145129495
631. this saved for state adjudication	in the first instance the two major areas where federal injunctions	had been most obnoxious but other areas remained vulnerable.	3.6108167654478756
632. meanwhile the supreme court like congress showed misgivings	concerning this aspect of government by injunction.	6.568981968790729
633. drawing upon	the traditional discretion of the chancellor mr justice holmes	introduced a series of self-imposed judicial restraints that culminated	in mr justice frankfurter's famous doctrine of abstention.	3.657549779129475
634. whereas the earlier cases turned rather narrowly upon the availability	of adequate state remedies the new emphasis is upon the nature of	the state policy at issue.	4.841422763990498
635. the classic case is railroad commission	v pullman.	4.354479797981038
636. the commission had issued an administrative order	which was challenged as discriminatory against negroes.	5.2985701027307845
637. its enforcement	was enjoined by a federal trial court.	5.204466881930977
638. on review the supreme	court via mr justice frankfurter found southern racial problems	a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal courts ought	not to enter unless no alternative to h adjudication is open.	4.922018221417464
639. an alternative was found in the vagueness of state law as to whether	the offending order had in fact been authorized.	4.084862785309283
640. reluctant as usual	to interpret state legislation- such interpretation can only be	a forecast rather than a determination- mr justice frankfurter	led a unanimous court to vacate the injunction.	4.844563087860651
641. but it is crucial	that here unlike burford the trial court was ordered to retain	the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity	to settle the state-law question.	3.857355177274152
642. the resources of equity are equal	to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as	well as the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication.	4.468233567801373
643. temporary abstention ie postponement is one thing;	refusal to adjudicate is another.	4.182602481535312
644. to the extent that the jurisdictional	principle of 1875 stands unmodified by subsequent legislation federal	equitable relief against state action must be available- or so	it seems to mr justice frankfurter.	5.0740945127194
645. in alabama public service	commission v southern ry co the commission had	refused to permit abandonment of certain uneconomic train facilities.	3.690916712779116
646. the railroad claiming deprivation of property without due process	of law sought injunctive relief.	4.983105429684655
647. the court held that federal	jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state	be obstructed; this in the name of equitable discretion.	4.379928626102767
648. justices frankfurter and jackson concurred in the court's result	for they found no merit in the railroad's claim.	5.057556181613073
649. but they objected	vigorously to the proposition that federal courts may refuse to exercise	jurisdiction conferred in a valid act of congress:   by	one fell swoop the court now finds that congress indulged in needless	legislation in the acts of 1910 1913 1925 1934 and 1937.	3.2704015338175343
650. by	these measures congress so the court in effect now decides gave	not only needless but inadequate relief since it now appears that	the federal courts have inherent power to sterilize the act of 1875 against	all proceedings challenging local regulation.	4.390696933173071
651. a most	revealing recent case is textile workers union v lincoln	mills.	4.274675675810666
652. the taft-hartley act gave the federal courts jurisdiction	over suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a	labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce.	4.471452536462726
653. on its face this merely provides a federal forum; it does	not establish any law for the federal judges to enforce.	3.8208840328256377
654. how	can judges exercise jurisdiction to enforce national rights when congress	has created none?	5.583228874976599
655.  the court held that congress had intended	the federal judiciary to fashion an appropriate law of labor-management	contracts.	3.890478470182828
656. in short congressional power to grant federal-question	authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that congress	need not create or specify the right to be enforced.	5.244061430894506
657. the lincoln mills decision authorizes a whole new body of federal	common law which as mr justice frankfurter pointed out	in dissent leads to one of the following incongruities:	conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective	bargaining agreements; displacement of state law by federal law	in state courts h in all actions regarding collective bargaining agreements;	or exclusion of state court jurisdiction over these matters.	3.1772179152489293
658. the justice's elaborate examination of the legislative history	of the provision in question suggests that congress' purpose	was merely to make unions suable.	4.524741011976274
659. with a few exceptions the lawmakers	seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction	involved- to say nothing of the delegation of lawmaking power to judges.	3.972001874593957
660. to avoid these constitutional difficulties mr justice frankfurter	was prepared to read the taft-hartley provision as concerned	with diversity rather than federal question jurisdiction.	5.3151701664521775
661. this	would satisfy what presumably was congress' major purpose- the suability	of unions.	4.182602481535312
662. it would also leave intact the states' traditional	authority in the realm of contract law.	6.845355387181852
663. and york decisions require federal courts in diversity cases	here again mr justice frankfurter	could not lightly accept the principle of wholesale judicial	legislation.	3.919459072011152
664. if congress wants to displace the states from areas	which they have customarily occupied let it do so knowingly and explicitly.	5.173879420231093
665. and let it do its own lawmaking and not leave that to federal	judges.	4.301089977027382
666. does lincoln mills suggest that if congress granted jurisdiction	over interstate divorce cases the federal courts would be	authorized to fashion a national law for the dissolution of marriages?	5.007239766691812
667. 	there is a common problem behind most of these federal question	and diversity cases.	4.402207777559681
668. congress has not clearly defined the bounds	between state and federal court competence.	6.425145942386993
669. it has the power to do	so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on	a case-by-case basis.	4.84720636297895
670. a careful student has suggested that in any	new revision of the judicial code the legislators would do well	to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should	be limited to those matters in which their expertise in federal law	might be used leaving to the state judiciaries the primary obligation	of pronouncing state law.	4.417696050629847
671. obviously the goal here proposed is the	guiding principle in mr justice frankfurter's opinions- to	the extent that congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion.	3.6599163583827736
672. the same rule of specialization and division of labor guides him in	the fela certiorari cases in the administrative law area	and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review.	4.984393811368753
673. mr justice black	no doubt concurs in principle but is more apt to make exceptions to	achieve a generous and just result.	3.6965290980494823
674. he will not be fooled	by technicalities.	11.373605720290406
675. with few	exceptions congress has not given federal courts exclusive authority	to enforce rights arising under federal law.	4.050683709456662
676. to put it differently	state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with respect	to most claims of federal right.	5.629284258863525
677. to insure uniformity in the meaning	of national law however state interpretations are subject to supreme	court review.	3.95272066132585
678. it may be noted parenthetically that to evade	desegregation	an ex-justice and former southern governor has urged	congress to abolish this reviewing authority.	5.577681994023852
679. the result of course	would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in	different states.	4.251817665900261
680. it would also probably mean different things within	the same state- depending upon what court rendered	decision.	6.096703756772545
681. we consider here only a few of many problems involved	in this crucial federal-state relationship.	5.192084450576278
682. the first is that enforcement	of national law in state litigation raises in reverse the old	diversity puzzle of the relation of procedure to substance.	4.882918175514113
683. subject to	certain constitutional restraints in favor of fair trials each level	of government is free to devise its own judicial procedures.	3.8718965743570726
684. litigants	who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that	court subject to its rules of procedure.	5.033020485371917
685. a similar canon applies to those	who press state claims in federal tribunals eg in diversity	cases.	3.874048773215712
686. in an fela	controversy the state court followed established state procedure	by construing a vague complaint most strongly against the complainant.	5.397545216976176
687. in other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon	the pleader by state law.	4.911246959170547
688. the result was that the plaintiff's case	was dismissed.	7.167889196408086
689. mr justice black led a reversing majority: strict	local rules of pleading cannot be used to impose unnecessary burdens	upon rights of recovery authorized by federal law.	3.745969061565264
690. here as	in the byrd case another element of state procedure was subsumed	to federal judge-made law.	5.796124236924885
691. justices frankfurter and jackson dissented:	one state may cherish formalities more than another one	state may be more responsive than another to procedural reforms.	3.467766426174774
692. if	a litigant chooses to enforce a federal right in a state court he	cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are plaintiffs who	press like claims arising under state law with regard to the form	in which the claim must be stated- the particularity for instance	with which a cause of action must be described.	4.492950938337875
693. federal law though invoked	in a state court delimits the federal claim- defines what	gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove it.	3.6051505913638033
694. but the form in	which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the state	exacts in the enforcement of like obligations created by it so long	as a requirement does not add to or diminish the right as defined	by federal law nor burden the realization of this right in the actualities	of litigation.	4.59109421263137
695. another problem in the area of federal-state	relationships is this: what constitutes reversible error in	a state decision?	4.83518907222627
696.  terminiello v chicago involved a conviction	for disorderly conduct under a local ordinance.	5.583228874976599
697. the conduct	in question was a speech.	4.484814815711922
698. the accused did not object to the trial court's	charge to the jury that discourse may constitute a breach of	the peace if it stirs the public to anger invites dispute brings about	a condition of unrest h.	4.4603865584122095
699. for present purposes it may be assumed	that this charge so narrowly limited speech as to violate the federal	constitution.	4.268602696535831
700. though the accused raised many other objections he	did not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings.	5.390360823851988
701. that is he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his	case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal right.	4.597643350176966
702. how else can one explain for example allowing the survival of the right	to amortize bond discount and premium but not	the right to amortize bond issue expenses; or allowing a deduction	for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization	but not a deduction for theft losses	sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered	after it; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depeciation	but not allowing rapid amortization of	emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization; or allowing survival	of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company	381 but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes?	4.083131721283958
703. 	these items and most of the others listed above seem	quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section	381.	4.048190061295399
704. there does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction	either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of	tax-avoidance possibilities.	7.843708903535889
705. with respect to items such as these the	provisions of section 381 viewed in historical perspective suggest	a rule requiring survival whether the items are beneficial or detrimental	to the surviving corporation.	3.635545912373673
706. to this extent some stretching	of the literal meaning of the committee report seems justified since	the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication if not the	language of the statute.	5.303778333234471
707. it is not contended that section	381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes.	5.012243480412929
708. such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction	of the statute alone; it would certainly violate the intention of	congress as expressed in the committee report; and in at least	one instance involving refund claims it might be contrary to another	provision of the united states code.	5.432008230242809
709. section	203 of the united states code voids an assignment of a claim against	the government unless made after it has been allowed the amount due	has been ascertained and a warrant for its payment has been issued.	3.695531496653318
710. if it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions this	section would prohibit a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for	taxes paid by a transferor corporation even though the reorganization	meets the requirements of section 381.	5.108286252774374
711. a clearly recognized	exception is a statutory merger or consolidation.	4.43026810195405
712. the leading case	seaboard air line railway v united states held that	the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor	and it has been consistently followed.	4.792388202248253
713. the court said the purpose	of the section was principally to spare the government the embarrassment	and trouble of dealing with several parties one of them a stranger	to the claim and to prevent traffic in claims particularly tenuous	claims against the government.	3.389392238612453
714. neither reason said the court applied	to the case at hand; furthermore congress could not be presumed	to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states.	5.42101243529272
715. other	exceptions are assignments for the benefit of creditors corporate dissolutions	transfers by descent or transfers by subrogation.	4.046453970113321
716. exceptions	are often classified as transfers by operation of law.	6.144814417540349
717. a tax-free reorganization not complying with the merger or consolidation	statutes of the states involved is difficult to fit into an operation	of law mold.	3.936996706038057
718. although it is in some ways comparable to	a voluntary sale of assets for cash to which section 203 quite clearly	applies the courts and treasury have held that acquiring corporations	in several types of non-taxable reorganizations may sue for refund	of taxes paid by transferors.	4.977360859233531
719. a recent case in point is mitchell	canneries v united states in which a claim against the government	was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership whose	partners were former stockholders and then to another corporation formed	by the partners.	3.7010383832872678
720. holding the final corporation entitled to sue on	the claim the court cited the seaboard novo trading and roomberg	cases for the proposition that h transfers by operation	of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not	assignments prohibited by the statute.	4.349111605180708
721. in an earlier case	kingan + co v united states an american corporation	was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a british corporation	in exchange for its own stock and then liquidating the british	corporation.	3.669745674587005
722. the anti-assignment statute was held not to prevent the	american corporation from suing for a refund of taxes paid by the british	corporation.	4.736404456293487
723. the transaction presumably would have qualified under	section 368 as a contractual reorganization followed	by a section 332 liquidation but not under section 368	as a statutory merger of consolidation.	3.1687540627978983
724. the court nevertheless relied	on the seaboard case and also mentioned that the shareholders	of the two corporations were the same.	4.876476442162927
725. in substance said the court	there was no transfer of equitable title.	4.412076471587193
726. the treasury arrives	at substantially the same conclusion but skirts the problem of section	203 of the united states code.	6.4522114109677995
727. revenue ruling 54-17 provides	that if the corporation against which a tax was assessed has since been	liquidated by merger with a successor corporation a claim for refund	should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the	corporation which paid the tax followed by the name of the successor	corporation.	3.514722646516913
728. proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also	be filed.	6.235063150943504
729. if the succession is a matter of public record certificates	of the secretaries of state or other public officials having custody	of the documents will suffice; if the succession is not of record	all documents relating to such succession properly certified are	required.	3.4925274347855835
730. the former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger	or consolidation the latter to a contractual acquisition.	5.109511617432157
731. the ruling	would not however apply to an acquisition of assets for cash.	3.700289227276755
732. a recent	ruling although rather confusing cites and follows rev rul	54-17.	5.866330554951393
733. the ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory	or contractual reorganization.	3.729902546439966
734. hence a successor corporation	in a c reorganization appears entitled to sue for a refund of taxes	paid by the merged corporation despite section 203.	5.017340036258649
735. in a b	reorganization followed by a section 332 liquidation those cases	which hold that section 203 is inapplicable to transfers in liquidation	appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of taxes	paid by the transferor.	3.5451824571043153
736. in fact a cash purchase of a corporation's	stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer	a claim for refund if the kimbell-diamond doctrine is not	applied to eliminate the intermediate step.	4.856093225578196
737. as stated in seaboard and numerous other cases the two	primary reasons for the enactment of section 203 of the united states	code were to prevent the government from having to deal with more	than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claims	on a contingent-fee basis.	3.805443897702458
738. the cases have allowed transfer of claims	if beneficial ownership is not changed.	5.178943078380889
739. the first reason would never	apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section	381 which is the only type presently under discussion.	4.143939176682372
740. section	381 applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a subsidiary	owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent a statutory merger or consolidation	an acquisition of substantially all a corporation's assets	solely in exchange for voting stock or a change of identity form	or place of organization.	4.808370277648574
741. in virtually every case the transferor corporation	is liquidated and its former stockholders either own outright	or have a continuing stock interest in the assets which gave rise	to the tax.	3.588064225900743
742. in these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting	claims is exceedingly remote.	7.125151136964095
743. furthermore in a c reorganization	the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation	which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger	to which the statute is clearly inapplicable.	3.4638135315928906
744. nor is it	at all likely that a desperate claim against the government will	be assigned on a contingent-fee basis in the guise of a tax-free reorganization.	5.0336835831256925
745. if the transferor has substantial assets other than the	claim it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to	acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim	for refund of taxes.	3.581377076566162
746. if such an unlikely transaction were to take place	it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase followed	by the prosecution of the claim by the wholly-owned subsidiary followed	by liquidation.	4.85276211468655
747. in the rare case where a corporation's only	substantial asset or its most important one is a claim for refund perhaps	its transfer should not be permitted whether the reorganization	takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets	for stock.	3.677120421822672
748. it appears then that although the matter is not	dealt with in section 381 a successor corporation in a reorganization	of a type specified in section 381 is entitled to sue for refund	of taxes paid by a transferor corporation.	4.943223136903516
749. section 203 of the united	states code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against	the government transferred in tax-free reorganizations.	3.641935767281418
750. the successor	corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims.	5.335826637227673
751. tax attributes of the transferor	there are certain tax attributes	of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts	of the particular reorganization involved.	3.69105667323623
752. for example property used	in the trade or business of a transferor corporation as defined	in section 1231 presumably would not retain its special status following	a non-taxable reorganization if it is not so used in the business	of the acquiring corporation.	5.579956380882717
753. the parent of a group filing consolidated	returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization	defined in section 368 but as a different corporation	for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation	which had not for example elected to file consolidated returns	with its own subsidiaries.	3.139637245856878
754. similar considerations presumably made	it difficult to prescribe a general rule where the acquired and acquiring	corporations have different methods of accounting	or depreciation.	4.93864050117996
755. other sections	of the 1954 internal revenue code provide for survival of certain of	a transferor's tax attributes following a tax-free reorganization.	3.739010109868995
756. section 362 requires carryover of the transferor corporation's basis	for property transferred and section 1223 provides for tacking on	the transferor's holding period for such property to that of the transferee.	5.088386629096709
757. section 169 permits a person acquiring grain-storage facilities	to elect to continue amortization over a 60-month period.	3.77920257541938
758. however	a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section 168 for	attributes similar to a loss	there may be certain items which are quite similar	to a net operating loss carryover or operating deficit and whose right	to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions	applicable to those items.	4.245643275926462
759. for example suppose another excess profits	tax similar to prior laws is enacted providing for carryover of	excess profits credits.	4.059413287344407
760. this carryover right has a number of things in	common with a net operating loss carryover.	6.260171486704967
761. it is an averaging device	intended to ease the tax burden of fluctuating income; it is a tax	benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expects	to have a high excess profits tax.	3.9478173571938084
762. under the 1939 code this item	was permitted to survive a tax-free reorganization in the stanton	brewery case but only over the dissent of judge learned hand	who wrote the majority opinion in the sansome case a leading case	requiring carryover of earnings and profits in a non-taxable reorganization.	4.416059745238803
763. since this type of item was not in the statute when	section 381 was enacted in 1954 one cannot say with certainty what effect	the enactment of that section should have.	3.9524063733658554
764. with respect to this	type of item one might properly apply the language of the committee	report quoted above which cautions against using section 381 as a	basis for treating other tax attributes not mentioned therein.	4.987784269829134
765. actually there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable	to a net operating loss carryover.	4.451378773098925
766. probably the primary reason	for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique	opportunity it presents for tax avoidance.	5.210153024070426
767. there were two	methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the	resources available: interviews in depth with a few selected	companies and the more limited interrogation of a large number of	companies by means of a mail questionnaire.	4.404815256686396
768. while the method	of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the	opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and	circumstances of a company's practices and opinions it also involved	the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems	of just a few individual companies.	4.667948210746442
769. as a result it was decided that	a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more	effective in determining the general practices and opinions of	small	firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems	of defense procurement that concern both industry and government.	3.949889497724167
770. it was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest	fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more	detailed nature.	5.53647529242737
771. it is recognized that a mail questionnaire	has inherent limitations.	5.385302660581431
772. there is the danger that the questions will	mean different things to different respondents.	6.977195634145078
773. simple yes or	no answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the	various respondents may have.	3.685338251241182
774. a respondent may want to make alternative	answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed	in the question.	6.400366061770748
775. there is also the problem of the respondent's frame	of reference.	6.952536411646172
776. is the respondent making a recommendation for his own	benefit for the benefit of his industry for the benefit of a specific	government department or service for the benefit of the defense	program for the benefit of small business or for the benefit of the	taxpayers?	5.71423267304871
777.    there is also the question of whether the respondent	based his answers on factual information and carefully considered	judgment or whether his answers were casual guesses.	4.417037370040519
778. finally there	is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is held- whether	it is a firm opinion or one that the respondent favors only slightly	over the alternatives.	5.194111566291157
779. the research team was very mindful of	these dangers and limitations of a mail questionnaire.	3.767201939714623
780. under the circumstances	however the team considered it would provide the most useful	information at this point.	5.87502402992453
781. in the preparation of the questionnaire	the problems noted above were carefully considered and the structure	and phraseology used were designed to minimize the effects of these	limitations.	3.906297360133464
782. the questionnaire was	designed to elicit three types of information: the facts regarding	certain characteristics of the respondents including their experience	with and interest in securing defense business; the actual	selling and buying practices of the respondents; and the attitudes	and opinions of the respondents concerning bidding procedures and	the methods of awarding defense contracts.	4.104890769835029
783. it was hoped that the facts	concerning the characteristics and practices of the respondents would	offer clues to the reasons why they took the positions and made the	recommendations which they did.	3.556369465541301
784. the major sections of the questionnaire	are devoted to the following:	information for classifying respondents	characteristics of defense sales activities	respondents' practices in participating	in advertised bidding for defense business	respondents' practices in participating in	negotiated bidding for defense purposes	respondents' opinions regarding advertised bidding	respondents' opinions regarding	negotiated bidding	respondents' preferences regarding the methods of awarding defense	contracts   the questionnaire	provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification	of the respondent was optional.	4.395403172865091
785. the questionnaire also stated	that in any event all replies would be treated confidentially.	3.865388856439537
786. it is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the	questionnaire identified themselves.	7.465465753213227
787. the questionnaire	the research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire	over a period of six months.	3.819045104115996
788. in june 1960 an early draft	of the questionnaire along with a cover letter was mailed to fourteen	companies in the state of washington.	6.139359403633505
789. several days after the companies	had received the questionnaire members of the research team contacted	the presidents of eleven of these companies in person or by phone	to discuss any ambiguities or difficulties the addressees might have	experienced in completing the questionnaire.	3.638910031306172
790. this test resulted in	further revisions of the questionnaire.	6.928243302983153
791. the research team was	concerned that responses from firms in the state of washington might	not be typical of those throughout the country or that the results might	be different when no phone or personal follow-up was made.	3.4888815788547545
792. accordingly	another test of the questionaire was made.	7.1094963127735795
793. the revised draft	was mailed in july 1960 to 100 firms throughout the united states.	3.5918083310632283
794. fifty of the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from 3500 names	submitted by member companies of the aerospace industries association	and fifty were selected in a similar manner from	a list of 1500 names compiled by the research team from the thomas	register.	4.5581724439049465
795. the method of compiling the aia and	tr lists will be described later.	3.999489988811217
796. ten days after the questionnaires	were mailed follow-up airmail postcards were sent urging	those companies which had not yet returned their questionnaires to do	so at once.	5.099781937057576
797. twenty-eight returns in all were received.	5.219666477665999
798. the responses	were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions	that were apparently not understood by the respondent.	4.675870265133493
799. the cover	letter questionnaire and follow-up postcard were then revised into	final form	of mailing lists	the objective of the study was to determine the	opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs.	3.1228519642324772
800. the	firms to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective	in mind.	6.25382857689881
801. three lists of companies were made and used in the	study.	4.808952092658866
802. the first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies	located in the state of washington which were personally known to	the research team to be active in defense work.	5.832958424330793
803. the primary consideration	in the compilation of this list was convenience in discussing the	questionnaire with company officers.	3.5539344386360034
804. the second list was derived	from a group of approximately 8000 names supplied to the research	team by the aerospace industries association.	5.459666208873187
805. these names were secured	from member companies by the association from the forty-four sources	listed in appendix f.	4.084236481766257
806. each source selected from its approved	bidders list about 200 firms which it believed to be small businesses	that participated in the production of weapons and weapon support systems.	5.402991052683834
807. where possible the name of an executive was supplied along with	the company name and address.	4.674086385728136
808. the forty-four lists supplied	by the aia member companies were merged and duplicate names were	eliminated.	4.900432726990401
809. there was further elimination of all companies that were	not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive.	4.82557969794832
810. the	remaining names were then checked against the thomas register list	and duplicate names were removed from the aia lists.	5.401581460413553
811. by these steps the final aia list was reduced from 8000 to 3500.	4.283677846046473
812. the third list was selected by the research team on a random	basis from the thomas register.	5.31153441974541
813. it was compiled as a control sample	to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the	lists	submitted by the members of the aerospace industries association	were materially different from those of other small firms selling to defense	programs.	3.681226392639841
814. such a difference might have resulted from:	the fact that the aerospace industries association members whose	lists were used did not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs.	5.3557388070455705
815. the fact that companies on the aia lists were already	participating in the defense program because of the manner of their	selection.	4.314672178294789
816. accordingly as in-group they might have different	opinions	and practices than an out-group composed of those companies	not so participating but interested in defense business.	4.963790946898937
817. the fact that aia lists might not have been selected on a random	basis.	4.824578746168095
818. the control sample was selected by taking the bottom	name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the alphabetical	listing of manufacturers in the thomas register.	4.853166071528881
819. if the bottom	name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified	the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was	substituted.	4.15006808260693
820. fifteen hundred names were selected in this fashion.	6.792261177931099
821. mailing the questionnaire	each questionnaire was mailed with a	cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive	of each firm.	3.5853166747464886
822. the questionnaires were mailed in seattle washington	and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of idaho montana	oregon and washington.	4.8696390024344725
823. airmail was used for the addresses outside	the pacific northwest.	5.380573745424214
824. each letter contained a postage-prepaid	return envelope by regular mail for addresses in the pacific	northwest and by airmail for those outside the pacific northwest.	4.954127836202233
825. approximately ten days after the questionnaire was mailed a	follow-up	airmail postcard was sent to each of the original names.	4.656089896643281
826. the	first test mailing was made in june 1960.	7.656672186800748
827. the second	test mailing was made in july 1960.	4.64818604601887
828. the final	mailing of the questionnaire was made late in august 1960 to 4900	firms consisting of 3450 from the aia list and 1450 from the	tr list.	4.398528065430878
829. returns received	over 1000 returns were received	within two weeks after the final mailing was made.	3.911034540509635
830. they continued	to arrive until the end of december 1960 by which time a total of	1343 returns were received representing 26.	5.729208983105886
831. 8 per cent of the 5014	questionnaires	sent out.	7.82609221165182
832. fifty-seven returns could not be used because	they were incomplete or received too late to be processed.	5.803907039605092
833. the remaining	1286 returns that were processed came from the categories in table	2.	4.096615103921759
834. each questionnaire was audited	for obvious mistakes and for comments and was identified by a serial	number by the source list from which the company name was selected	and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the postmark	on the return envelope.	4.835350608229893
835. all responses except comments were	numerically coded to permit use of data-processing equipment.	4.437978198919889
836. the codes	were key-punched	into ibm punch cards and verified.	5.650577481330174
837. each return	required three cards and involved key punching 228 digital columns.	4.573656184950225
838. in order to be able to properly relate the data for a single company	each of the three cards comprising the set for each firm was identified	with the appropriate serial number of the respondent.	5.746426361528097
839. the cards were	then processed using standard ibm punch card equipment including	an ibm 650 computer.	3.570845587849075
840. the first step in processing was	to analyze the returns from questions 1 2 and 3 to determine	whether the respondents were large businesses or small businesses in	accordance with the definitions contained in aspr section 1-701.	4.696434978984038
841. the results are shown in table 3.	4.729339608989771
842. the returns from companies classified as large businesses were set aside	and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions	and practices of small firms.	4.942576098676822
843. the second step in processing	was to compare the responses from companies on the aia list with	those from companies on the tr list in order to determine whether	it would be appropriate to merge the responses for the purposes of	the study.	3.4004889237823255
844. the methods and results of this comparative analysis are	described in appendix h.	5.207168246864651
845. it was concluded that it would be appropriate	to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all	small businesses engaged in or wishing to sell to defense programs.	3.885136108446715
846. in the first place the two groups of firms when combined had characteristics	and practices that were more representative of companies	that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the aia	list alone.	5.091329867255602
847. the vast central valley of california is one of the most	productive agricultural areas in the world.	4.165938584987967
848. during the summer of 1960	it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle.	6.38144220936163
849. the contestants in this economic struggle are the agricultural	workers organizing committee of the afl-cio	and the agricultural employers of the state.	3.4069613876257354
850. by virtue of	the legal responsibilities of the department of employment in the	farm placement program we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between	these two forces.	5.981645932316214
851. it is not a pleasant or easy position but one	we have endeavored to maintain.	4.964485158670992
852. we have sought to be strictly neutral	as between the parties but at the same time we have been required	frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose.	5.834080777388598
853. inevitably one side was pleased and the other displeased regardless	of how we ruled.	4.646000573291814
854. often the displeased parties interpreted our decision	as implying favoritism toward the other.	6.29536899014373
855. we have consoled ourselves	with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one	of the consequences of any decision in an adversary proceeding.	4.460640551199589
856. it	is disconcerting nevertheless to read in a labor weekly perluss	knuckles down to growers and then to be confronted with a growers'	publication which states perluss recognizes obviously phony and	trumped-up strikes as bona fide.	4.832511733196074
857. for a number of years	there have been sporadic attempts in california to organize farm workers.	4.9043671760521725
858. these attempts met with little sucess for a variety of reasons.	6.907972232134923
859. they were inadequately financed without experienced leadership and	lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole.	4.141764277186588
860. this past	year the pattern has been different: the organizing program had the	full support of the afl-cio which supplied staff and money	to the awoc as well as moral support.	5.198164933244895
861. leadership was experienced	and skillful and financial resources were significant.	4.477601198394805
862. regardless	of where personal sympathies may lie as between the parties failure	to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts	of life.	5.0609444082818955
863. as a result of these changed conditions the impact	of the organizational effort on agricultural labor-management relations	has been much greater than in the past.	4.306535278791379
864. the awoc has been able	to employ the traditional weapons of labor- the strike and the	picket	line- with considerable success particularly in the area of wages.	4.8542881886067555
865. by the very nature of the situation it is the union which	has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management.	5.143371215832481
866. to date at least the strategy of the awoc has been	selective; that is to say to concentrate on a particular crop or activity	in a particular area at a strategic time rather than any broadside	engagement with management throughout an area or the state.	4.881925416420497
867. primarily we became involved in these disputes because of our referral	obligations under our farm placement program.	3.744109221929566
868. normally because	agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance we would	not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade	dispute provision of the unemployment insurance code although	such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility.	4.589817874203458
869. but the current	issues arose out of the wagner-peyser act concerning referrals	to an establishment where a labor dispute exists and out of public	law 78 and the migrant labor agreement if mexican nationals were	employed at the ranch.	3.7940144723977696
870. most of us remember and think of the wagner-peyser	act in its historical sense as a major milestone in the	development of public placement services.	5.877989075957505
871. infrequently do we think	of it as a living continuing operating control over the system.	4.451357065792638
872. however	when labor disputes arise its provisions come clearly into play.	5.9245075971793435
873. california has accepted the provisions of that act	by enacting into our code a provision that	the state of california accepts the provisions of the	wagner-peyser act h and will observe and comply with the requirements	of that act.	3.1964015653323035
874. with respect to labor disputes the wagner-peyser	act states only   in carrying out the provisions	of this act the secretary is authorized and directed to provide for	the giving of notice of strikes or lock-outs to applicants before they	are referred to employment.	4.723491587993776
875. other provisions of the act empower	the secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its provisions	and he has done so.	4.024580199146585
876. the pertinent regulation for our purposes	is section 602.	5.650577481330174
877. 2 as follows:   referrals in labor	dispute situations.	5.682046289038164
878. no person shall be referred to a position the	filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which	is vacant because the former occupant is on strike or is being locked	out in the course of a labor dispute or the filling of which	is an issue in a labor dispute.	4.6305248085622335
879. with respect to positions not covered	by subparagraph of this paragraph any individual may be	referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists provided	he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time	of his referral.	3.5467003379089017
880. in analyzing this regulation let us take	the last sentence first.	6.3182816472690195
881. it permits referrals under certain circumstances	even when there is a labor dispute provided the individual is	given written notice of such a dispute.	4.470458478894249
882. assume for example a situation	where a farm has a packing shed and fields.	6.005928707707263
883. the packing shed workers	go on strike.	4.484814815711922
884. there is no dispute involving fieldwork.	9.278860368731365
885. we concluded	that we may refer workers to the fieldwork	provided we give them written notice of the packing shed dispute.	3.8798556860991007
886. so far no troublesome cases have arisen under this provision.	7.13045210872502
887. it is the first part of the regulation that is currently at issue.	6.109262210152714
888. note that it prohibits referrals under either condition	or condition.	7.06461043021643
889. employer representatives have contended that the secretary	has gone beyond his authority by such a prohibition on the	grounds that the wagner-peyser act requires only written notice to	the prospective worker that a dispute exists.	3.230113137190338
890. the matter	got into the courts this way: one of the early strikes called	by the awoc was at the digiorgio pear orchards in yuba county.	5.553895303222247
891. we found that a labor dispute existed and that the workers had left	their jobs which were then vacant because of the dispute.	4.571935965307797
892. accordingly	under clause of the secretary's regulation we suspended	referrals to the employer.	5.739974350684024
893. the employer seeking to continue his harvest challenged	our right to cease referrals to him and sought relief in the superior	court of yuba county.	3.441727307797516
894. the court issued a temporary restraining	order directing us to resume referrals.	5.661784471302859
895. we of course obeyed the court	order.	5.903741271583776
896. however the attorney general of california at the request	of the secretary of labor sought to have the jurisdiction over	the issue removed to the federal district court on grounds that	it was predominantly a federal issue since the validity of the secretary's	regulation was being challenged.	5.309403777733264
897. however the federal court	held that since the state had accepted the provisions of the wagner-peyser	act into its own code and presumably therefore also the	regulations it was now a state matter.	3.509181689192708
898. it accordingly refused to assume	jurisdiction whereupon the california superior court made the	restraining order permanent.	5.822387324843191
899. under that order we have continued referring	workers to the ranch.	4.945621750837393
900. a similar case arose at the bowers ranch	in butte county and the superior court of that county issued similar	restraining orders.	5.0430757226280996
901. the growers have strenuously argued	that i should have accepted the superior court decisions as conclusive	and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision	in the secretary's regulation.	3.1524264895335206
902. i cannot accept that view	either as a lawyer or as an administrator.	6.479213893531513
903. first let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved.	5.886976836567446
904. it is an accepted juridical principle in california that a superior	court decision does not constitute a binding legal precedent.	5.529698819939636
905. it	is conclusive unless appealed only upon the particular parties to	the particular action which was heard.	4.12970940785518
906. it is not binding upon another	superior court which could rule to the contrary.	6.382855243222662
907. only when a decision	is rendered by the district court of appeal	is a binding precedent established.	4.179700189433925
908. in that event	we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative interpretation	of the matter and one which we can follow statewide with confidence	that the policy will not be overthrown in other superior courts.	5.296798841417015
909. but over and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent	decision i am convinced that the decisions of the superior courts	which in effect nullify the secretary's regulation are not a	correct interpretation of the secretary's power under the federal	law.	3.578347160060221
910. i believe i am in good company in this view.	7.037620271278468
911. the attorney general	of california concurs in this interpretation and has filed an appeal	from these decisions to the district court of appeal.	3.3530711693172566
912. the attorney	general of the united states in considering the power of the	secretary to issue similar regulations under the wagner-peyser act	relating to the interstate recruitment of farm workers has rendered	an opinion sustaining his authority.	5.117153883766834
913. further and as an evidence of	legislative intent only the senate of the united states recently	defeated by a substantial majority the holland amendment to the	fair labor standards act which would have specifically limited	the regulatory authority of the secretary in these matters.	3.9521023988570025
914. next	let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications	of a failure on our part to pursue our appeals.	5.396660831725867
915. there is far	too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter	hanging in midair.	4.915083511808039
916. the ramifications of the issue are enormous.	5.8743971957932475
917. a	decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have	to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations and might in	effect place the public employment services in the position of acting	as strikebreakers.	3.5795066591703564
918. the public interest is so dominant in such an issue	that i cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative	order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action	in one or two superior courts in the state.	4.581705212756214
919. it is an issue which	may well reach the supreme court of the united states before judicial	finality is achieved.	5.7086759331414685
920. as an administrator i cannot place	the employment service in california in jeopardy of being out of compliance	with the federal laws by my failure to pursue the avenues of	appeal open to me.	4.878816919268261
921. to have applied statewide the decisions of the two	cases heard in superior court in my opinion would have placed us	clearly out of compliance with the wagner-peyser act and would have	immediately opened the way for the secretary of labor were he so	inclined to notify the governor of such noncompliance set a date for	hearing and issue his finding.	3.527716629306207
922. the impact of noncompliance under	the wagner-peyser act is clear: the withdrawal of some $11 million	a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service	program or as a corollary the taking over by the federal government	of its operation.	4.509905776961325
923. thus far the cases which have come before	the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is	vacant due to a strike- condition in the regulation of the secretary.	3.4357165697257344
924. none has yet arisen under condition relating to referral	to jobs the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute.	5.617429765982198
925. here the problem is essentially one of defining the word filling.	5.438472439261005
926. should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements	as job specifications union membership union jurisdiction and	the like?	5.083250441587281
927.  or should it have a broader connotation of including wage	demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the	mechanics of filling the job.	3.6869397080082185
928. because of the uncertainty	of this definition i solicited the interpretation of the secretary	of labor.	6.765182913011023
929. he has advised me that the narrower interpretation is the	proper one; that is that if wages for example is the only issue	in a labor dispute and no workers have left their jobs because of the	dispute we may continue to make referrals.	3.494633108451513
930. martin and stendler present evidence that infants and young	children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual	level simply by combining objects and counting them.	4.861821061560637
931. after they	have developed concepts they are free from the necessity of manipulating	objects; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely.	4.403591078845857
932. the ability to think seems to increase consistently with age.	5.952967917556376
933. one	experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between	the eleventh and twelfth years.	4.0683852436856025
934. many studies indicate that	elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science;	that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes	and events; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities	change and broaden.	4.605727696363613
935. how a child	feels about himself about other people and about the tasks confronting	him in school may have as much influence on his success in school	as his physical and intellectual characteristics.	3.5493379294442353
936. a considerable amount	of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure child is not	likely to do well in school subjects.	5.278256563308104
937. emotional maturity is the result	of many factors the principal ones being the experiences of the	first few years of the child's life.	3.8485016262063008
938. however the teacher who understands	the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly influential	in helping pupils gain confidence security and satisfaction.	5.487401163814721
939. concerning this responsibility of the teacher suggestions for helping	children gain better control of the emotions are presented in chapter	11.	4.117317582873366
940. the following generalizations about the emotional characteristics	of elementary-school children may be helpful.	5.786486379755926
941. typically	the young child's emotional reactions last for a relatively short	time as contrasted to those of an adult.	4.048715548613717
942. as the child grows	older his emotional reactions lead to moods or emotional states	drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly rather than in	short abrupt outbursts.	5.7069358557416034
943. studies of the growth and decline	of children's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects noises	falling and unexpected movement decline during the preschool years	but that fears of the dark of being alone and of imaginary creatures	or robbers increase.	3.178958748424949
944. ridiculing a child for being afraid	or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing	with the problem; more effective solutions include explanations	the example of another child or conditioning by associating the feared	object place or person with something pleasant.	4.433255443611828
945. children	need help in learning to control their emotions.	4.6724501027054846
946. the young child	learns from parents and teachers that temper tantrums screaming kicking	and hitting will not get him what he wants; the older child learns	that intense emotional outbursts will not win approval by his peers	and therefore makes a real effort to control his emotions.	4.305387946273037
947. children differ widely in their emotional responses.	4.913686410369733
948. among infants	the patterns of emotional responses are similar; as the influence	of learning and environment are felt emotional behavior becomes individualized.	5.299375092431005
949. although no national norms exist	for the social development of children the teacher can find a great	deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed	by children at various age levels.	3.5409358837834084
950. the following summary will	give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school	children; the student will certainly want to explore more	deeply into the fascinating study of immature individuals struggling	to meet their developmental needs and at the same time trying to learn	the rules of the game in the ever-expanding number of groups in which	they hold membership.	4.695462395488581
951. during early childhood children	are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than	they are in the approval of other children; after they have been in	school a few years their interest in playmates of their own age increases	and their interest in adults decreases; the child who had once	considered it a treat to accompany his parents on picnics and family	gatherings now considers it a bore.	3.7865836031052305
952. in late childhood the influence	of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase;	the group sets the styles in clothing the kind of play engaged in	and the ideals of right and wrong behavior.	4.831346288937501
953. in early childhood	the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his	own age or a year or two older who can do the things he likes to do;	such factors as sex intelligence and status in the group do not	influence his choice much at this time.	3.664690668177192
954. in later childhood	an interest in team games replaces individual play; loyalty to the group	a feeling of superiority over those who are not members and unwillingness	to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant traits.	5.343343652835193
955. during early childhood boys tease and bully on the average	more than girls; those who feel inferior or insecure engage in	these activities more than do well-adjusted children.	3.669363008493217
956. during	late childhood boys like to tease jostle and talk smart to girls;	girls who are more mature than boys frown upon the youthful antics	of boys of their own age.	4.762306869012796
957. by the time pupils reach the sixth	grade their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed;	they exhibit a keen interest in social political and economic problems	but they frequently have vague and incorrect notions about the	terms they use rather glibly in their routine school work.	3.4213482205273174
958. between	the ages of two and four years negativism or resistance to adult	authority is noticeable; after the fourth year it begins to decline.	4.781103268798495
959. however as we have seen in later childhood the child begins to	substitute the standards of the peer group for those of parents and teachers.	4.137285232688852
960. the elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability	to work in groups.	5.187735111958531
961. the child in the primary grades can play harmoniously	with one companion but his desire to be first in everything	gets him into trouble when the group gets larger; he wants to be with	people but he hasn't yet learned to cooperate.	3.407738556001332
962. in the middle grades	however he begins to participate more effectively in group activities	such as selecting a leader helping to make plans and carry on	group activities and setting up rules governing the enterprise.	4.972076408971061
963. the teacher should study the individual pupil	much progress has	been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding	children yet in almost any classroom today can be found children	whose needs are not being met by the school program.	3.6435085679124284
964. some are failing	to achieve as much as their ability would permit; others never	seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom.	6.220821185432304
965. these children	have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults	who did not understand.	3.984800322203241
966. many school systems now employ school	psychologists and child guidance specialists.	6.641940942877285
967. these specialists	perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children	who need special attention by suggesting ways of meeting the needs	of individual children in the regular classroom and by providing clinical	services for severely maladjusted children.	3.4617531228284557
968. it is the classroom	teacher however who has daily contacts with pupils and who is in a	unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice.	5.355161202731254
969. indeed a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work	of the elementary-school teacher rather than merely an additional	chore.	5.011104556602069
970. teachers and administrators in many elementary schools	have assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade into groups on the	basis of test scores solves the problem of meeting the needs of individuals.	5.003825338668009
971. what they should recognize is that children who have been placed	in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely	in attributes that influence success and that they still must be	treated as individuals.	3.835889022667651
972. although the teacher must be concerned with	maintaining standards he must also be concerned about understanding	factors that inhibit	studies conducted in various	sections of the united states indicate that many children in elementary	schools are maladjusted emotionally and that many of them are	failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects.	5.242933230132896
973. one study	which involved 1524 pupils in grades one to six found that 12 percent	of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were reading	a year below capacity.	3.4673337865341547
974. it is apparent therefore that the teacher	needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and	adjustment of children.	5.5563516039141545
975. when a child fails to meet the standards of	the school in his rate of learning insecurity unhappiness and other	forms of maladjustment frequently follow.	4.025972827012357
976. these maladjustments in	turn inhibit learning and a vicious cycle is completed.	6.066364874867253
977. it is	easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving	in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy or that the	child who lacks interest in school who dislikes the teacher or who	is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent.	3.368237723175595
978. the causes of retardation	and maladjustment may be found in physical factors such as defective	speech or hearing impaired vision faulty motor coordination a frail	constitution chronic disease malnutrition and glandular malfunctioning.	4.659583179454925
979. they may be caused by poor health habits such as faulty eating	and sleeping habits.	4.746008110300879
980. they may be related to mental immaturity or lack	of aptitude for certain types of school work.	6.317364404748039
981. the curriculum may	be too difficult for some and too easy for others.	3.8220924861144594
982. teaching methods	learning materials and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead	to maladjustments for some children.	5.2693531817812636
983. unwholesome family relations	broken homes and undesirable community influences may also be contributing	factors.	4.46142869435397
984. this is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit	learning and contribute to maladjustment among children.	6.816641466935386
985. moreover	these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner.	5.387933134909964
986. a	vision handicap that may produce nervous tension and reading	disability	for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement	in reading.	4.807873378411027
987. an impoverished home that may discourage one child may constitute	the motivation causing another to work harder for successful	achievement in school.	3.701367932436392
988. at any rate the teacher who recognizes common	causes of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal	to eliminate the causes of pupil discouragement failure and maladjustment.	5.201833887943073
989. successful teaching	involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand	why he behaves as he does in certain situations and how his achievement	in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment.	3.327093690009675
990. the classroom teacher cannot be expected to be as proficient in the	use of the techniques of child study as the clinical psychologist;	he cannot be expected to administer all the tests and gather all the information	needed about each child in his classroom.	4.814454359513155
991. he can be expected	however to examine and interpret the information already available;	to refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual children;	and to utilize opportunities arising in connection with regular	classroom activities for gaining a better understanding of his	pupils.	3.5548878029613884
992. this section deals with some of the sources of information that	can be tapped by the classroom teacher; chapter 15 provides more	detailed information about specific techniques used in evaluating pupil	progress.	5.40048908069017
993. most school systems today maintain	a system of cumulative records of pupils.	4.659276624172286
994. these records when systematically	maintained provide much information about the children which	the teacher can use in guidance instruction grouping and reporting	to parents.	5.3321550398349675
995. each teacher has in his classroom a metal file equipped	with a lock which is used to store cumulative record folders.	4.013228842855323
996. during	summer vacation periods these records are stored in the office of	the principal.	5.7535564091527815
997. only the teacher and other professional personnel are	permitted to see or use these records.	4.501681747676017
998. each new teacher to whom the	pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record	and to bring it up to date.	5.542071985406273
999. some school systems provide written instructions	to principals and teachers designating when certain information	is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how	the information is to be summarized and used.	3.6237522783835563
1000. the summary report on desegregation progress in education in	the middle-south region 1959-1960 clearly shows two pieces of	information.	4.705010556909502
1001. the summary report which was prepared for this conference	indicates first that actual or pending school desegregation is	increasing; second that both actual and pending desegregation is	with few exceptions the product or result of court order.	3.1182152175531104
1002. the report	together with other information suggests that desegregation in the	schools is slow.	5.078074081494962
1003. the middle-south region as defined by the	national association of intergroup relations officials	consists of the states of kentucky maryland tennessee west	virginia delaware virginia and the district of columbia.	3.338041037036823
1004. the	states and the nation's capital all have some desegregation in	fact some dating back to 1954; but the region also embraces some of	the staunchest opposition.	4.67288338831304
1005. desegregation has been opposed by massive	resistance interposition pupil assignment	and hate bombings.	4.231197729340223
1006. now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation	and such increase as a result of court order.	7.195893523791992
1007. elementary school desegregation came to owen and union counties	which already had high school desegregation.	3.8849121559715263
1008. the action was a result	of a court order the citation for which	is taken from the summary report for this	conference.	4.949366264608476
1009. in maryland the harford county board of education	had prepared a desegregation plan which the court approved but	which a plaintiff had challenged; thus county school board and federal	court joined hands here to promote school desegregation.	3.2555846333207885
1010. additional	school desegregation in tennessee resulted from a court	order opening a school serving children of military personnel.	5.138210239895059
1011. similarly	further desegregation may come from suits pending in three tennessee	cities chattanooga knoxville and memphis.	3.8849121559715263
1012. in west virginia	the number of white and negro children attending the same school	has increased almost twofold.	5.511953053517552
1013. there are no court decisions here.	7.097800126220946
1014. as in maryland a district court has approved an official plan	of school desegregation in delaware.	5.988297558997049
1015. as a result of the state	board of education plan negro children entered heretofore white	elementary schools in five districts.	4.5157557260973755
1016. the third circuit court of	appeals is reviewing an appeal from the plan.	5.559898878383699
1017. in virginia	court orders led to desegregation in charlottesville and floyd counties.	4.372974062082154
1018. desegregation in pulaski county is pending because of court	order although date of admission is not yet determined.	5.215171351768844
1019. negro parents	have filed application for admission of additional children to schools	in alexandria arlington fairfax and warren counties.	3.8078316992707273
1020. desegregation	can also result from additional suits brought by negro plaintiffs	against school boards in newport news fairfax county arlington	county and norfolk.	4.861416487662795
1021. as a school district the district	of columbia has had desegregated schools since 1954 shortly	after the supreme court decision.	4.477336348529096
1022. this recapitulation makes	it clear that school desegregation continues including the old dominion	state in spite of its stern resistance.	5.710732804818812
1023. the record is clear that	increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result	of a court order; that on the immediate horizon if further large-scale	desegregation comes it will result from court	orders on suits filed in several middle-south states.	3.099464254342051
1024. knowledge	that thousands of school districts are involved and observation that	school desegregation has occurred in only a handful in 1959-1960 leads	to a conclusion that desegregation-from-court-order is slow.	4.683918250208666
1025. before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us at	this regional conference i wish to note a small item in the summary	report as it refers to the district of columbia.	3.7706963653809518
1026. that reference	in the report is continuation of the trend toward an all-negro	school system a remark apparently occasioned by the increase of negro	school population from 74.	5.064152268638131
1027. 1 per cent to 76.	8.545823072995299
1028. i see no	real prospects for an all-negro school population.	6.65629273910685
1029. west of rock creek	park is still monolithically white and is in fact increasingly white	as a result of georgetown's conversion-by-renovation housing program.	4.6832402043160695
1030. nearby foggy bottom is ousting negroes.	7.163184125958424
1031. the large acreage	in the southwest redevelopment area beckons white people- what with	high-priced town houses and elevator apartments.	3.6332488068553537
1032. the capitol hill	rehabilitation like foggy bottom replaces negroes with whites	.	5.315789116454725
1033. the sharpest	break with tradition the past and present of white ring around	a black core may come with the opening of nearby montgomery county	suburbs to negro residents and presumably the consequent conclusion	of some whites that they cannot escape the negro by fleeing to	the suburbs.	3.2080512645575587
1034. in fact short of fleeing to warrenton virginia or rockville	maryland white people may have to live with negroes.	6.47006286289849
1035. all	of this must be taken into account before the image of an all-negro	dc public school system is conjured up.	4.821825052792172
1036. solve	from the summary report before us at this conference a number	of problems are apparent.	5.331440467598945
1037. they vex us and perplex us but generally	do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems.	3.8661034358684527
1038. first how can we step up the desegregation movement?	7.310020615776629
1039.  it is slow.	8.213217004394902
1040. i believe we all want more schools where white and negro together	can and do attend.	6.163066141825329
1041. i believe we all want no child denied admission to	a school on account of his color.	4.4164138348622775
1042. in general members of nairo	would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence	or within his residence zone.	5.378334496309659
1043. how to achieve this objective is	a problem but we are not divided on what we want.	5.03157154825566
1044. second as	we increase the number of desegregated school districts and schools themselves	how can we achieve this action through school board action?	5.607636051117295
1045. 	it may be county school board or state school board action as well	as that of municipal school boards.	3.632711015013689
1046. correlatively can we reduce the	role of the district courts so that the action is that of the people	of the community or other school district and not that of the law court?	6.188323860131719
1047. 	this is a problem and i believe there is little difference of	opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise and	effect a plan of desegregation.	3.9346086831462506
1048. third how can we insure a systematic	and continuing group relations education in the schools?	6.073165079418338
1049.  not	simply a brief program when the schools are actually desegregated but	a continuing program that also promotes integration that encourages	the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or negro	but as human beings.	3.431517499197341
1050. again the problem is how to get it done and	in what form to offer the group relations education; not whether it	should be done.	6.125691157846206
1051. fourth in the segregated school system during	the period before desegregation how can we assure equal opportunity?	3.8636613819693553
1052. 	in fact in the desegregated school system which may have a good	many schools with all-negro population how can we assure equal opportunity?	5.148106107751603
1053. 	this is a problem but we are not divided over its importance	or by its existence.	4.861561810506442
1054. fifth in the segregated school system	or in the all-negro or all-white schools how can we encourage better	group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong	to the group?	4.778131195087601
1055.  can we help children adjust to images of other	children when the latter are not actually present.	4.304451685372834
1056. if we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively	united fashion then there are twice as many issues which i judge sharply	issue	since on the one hand school	desegregation	has come in virginia hand-in-glove with pupil assignment shall	we support the plan?	4.906477467832826
1057.  on the basis of pupil assignment criteria	judge albert bryan has assigned negro children to formerly white	schools in arlington and alexandria virginia.	4.230470761946717
1058. shall we support pupil	assignment?	8.628706297647671
1059.  on the other hand looking at the larger picture	is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off blocked or	reduced school desegregation to a trickle?	3.9307275071480774
1060.  shall we therefore	oppose the plan?	7.850514579687816
1061.  this question is an issue because it likely divides	issue	no 2.	4.589382120020613
1062. in large cities	like baltimore louisville and washington dc should school	desegregation be extended to all-negro and all-white schools by	assigning white and negro teachers respectively?	4.976569394374501
1063.  on the one hand	do we argue the supreme court decision required only that a child	not be denied admission to a school on account of his race?	4.229126556537165
1064.  or should	we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different	races and that that is impossible in an all-something-or-the-other	school we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust	to people of another race within the school namely to a teacher of another	race.	4.546235659563128
1065. we can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation	impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated	issue no 3.	4.160633841896382
1066. the earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that	resulted in desegregation.	5.235947622867308
1067. in each instance the plaintiff was a private	citizen.	5.597373394503804
1068. in thousands of school districts indeed in the entire	state of mississippi no plaintiff has come forth.	5.469912327414678
1069. and i have established	that the action of municipal county or state school boards	or boards of education is small infinitesimally small in comparison	with the number of districts.	4.282121101368605
1070. is the requirement that the plaintiff be	a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement?	6.2109960547937195
1071. 	should congress authorize the attorney general to file suit to accomplish	admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance?	4.118693980343359
1072. 	even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision	for the attorney general to act was eliminated should we	nevertheless	support such a clause?	4.932362611101299
1073.  this is an issue for it divides	issue no 4.	5.685506387066093
1074. withholding of funds to	schools	that deny children on account of race.	6.136259031619094
1075. which in 1957 divided even a liberal group like the american	veterans committee.	4.5794027334178455
1076. should we support a clause in federal	school construction or school assistance legislation that would	deny federal funds to a school district that denies admission to a	child on account of his race?	4.8052756008117985
1077.  this is softer than earlier powell amendments	which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts.	4.185174572575757
1078. there is nonetheless considerable argument against the clause	softened though it be on the grounds that federal aid is so necessary	to the public schools.	5.522062604531797
1079. the federal funds limitation enlists the support	issue no 5.	4.13722289542765
1080. state or county	or municipality be required to furnish public education?	6.896595224650795
1081.  for the	school year 1959-1960 the prince edward county board	of supervisors voted not to provide funds for public education and	the school board therefore could provide no public education- for white	or negro children.	3.3877246439302837
1082. is public education in this american democracy	of such importance that no child should be denied public education?	5.703038261710981
1083. 	or is this subject a matter of self-determination a matter of states	rights or county rights?	5.004970471906443
1084.  if people don't want to provide public	education should they be forced to do so?	6.47689685497105
1085.  even if we marshal substantial	agreement behind mandatory public education we likely cannot	expect that all the states will enact the legislation.	4.353766724600997
1086. should the	requirement which must therefore be federal in nature be legislated	by the united states congress?	6.64785649674944
1087.  or must it become law by amendment	of the united states constitution?	5.745783773185446
1088.  we actually have two issues	issue no 6.	7.543900632520252
1089. federal	responsibility	if the above issue is settled	by requiring public education for all citizens issue no 6 may	be moot.	3.685338251241182
1090. if on the other hand it is not settled or while it is being	debated and resolved does the federal government have a responsibility	in situations like that in prince edward county?	5.792054325935714
1091.  nearly	half the children still receive no education.	4.913686410369733
1092. must or should the federal	government help?	7.7214952580330865
1093.  should the government directly provide education	for the children who want public education?	4.438299232001964
1094. 	the next question is whether board members favor their own social	classes in their roles as educational policy-makers.	5.364887069747444
1095. on the whole	it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit	way.	4.631171730802319
1096. seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly	drawn.	5.583228874976599
1097. a hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment	of a free public junior college in a community where there already	was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately	but was too expensive for working-class youth.	3.446870795624827
1098. in situations	of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education.	6.105039483225827
1099. campbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve	western cities over the period of 1931-40 and found little or no	relationship between certain social and economic factors and school	board competence as judged by a panel of professional educators who	studied the voting records on educational issues.	3.2752359846577357
1100. the few cases	of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not	to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who	favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay	increases for teachers and such issues are not issues of educational	policy.	4.336087491650152
1101. in general it appears that trustees and board members	attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of	educational policy and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant	values of the society are middle-class values which are generally	thought	to be valid for the entire society.	3.7603862390654506
1102. there have been very few cases	of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any	other class in the field of educational policy.	6.495313937488649
1103. if there were more such	cases it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers	favor their own social classes.	4.878980038806386
1104. there is currently a major	controversy of public education in which group interests and values	are heavily engaged.	6.000962042246069
1105. this is the issue of segregated schools in the	south.	5.685296580155807
1106. in this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial	groups rather than social-class groups.	7.177257456704519
1107. thus the white middle and	lower classes are arrayed against the negro middle and lower classes.	4.326258227486471
1108. this conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class	people better than it suits white lower-class people.	5.473690358842624
1109. if this happens	there may be some class conflict in the south with school boards	and school teachers taking the middle-class position.	4.381940728340517
1110. profession	the members of the educational profession have	a major voice in the determination of educational policy their position	being strongest in the universities.	5.3652309167382874
1111. they are mostly upper-middle-	and lower-middle-class people with a few in the upper class.	4.925622412042253
1112. do they	make class-biased decisions?	11.15100542404613
1113.    in a society dominated by middle-class	values and working in an institution which transmits and strengthens	these social values it is clear that the educational profession	must work for the values which are characteristic of the society.	3.923345446386534
1114. there is no problem here.	10.281290747460961
1115. the problem arises if it does arise when	the educator has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his	professional competence but which bears some relation to the social	structure.	3.777179093562282
1116. for instance in giving school grades or in making recommendations	for the award of a college scholarship does he consciously	or unconsciously favor students of one or another social class?	5.268767811061987
1117.  again	in deciding on the content and method of his teaching does he favor	a curriculum which will make his students stronger competitors in the	race for higher economic status or does he favor a curriculum which	strengthens students in other ways?	3.3560311139486783
1118.    the answers to questions	such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the educator's	own social-class position and also upon his social history as well as	upon his personality and what he conceives his mission to be as an educator.	4.65787696807145
1119. in a set of case studies of teachers with various social-class	backgrounds wattenberg illustrates a variety of approaches to students	and to teaching which depend upon the teacher's personality as	well as on his social-class background.	3.622382677697443
1120. one upward-mobile teacher may	be a hard taskmaster for lower-class pupils because she wants them to	develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb while	another upward-mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with	lower-class pupils because he knows their disadvantages and deprivations	at home and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment.	4.63146949381378
1121. one social-class factor which plays a large part in educational policy	today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are	upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class families.	4.529999517660723
1122. their own experience in the social system influences their work and	attitudes as teachers.	6.164747470947178
1123. while this influence is a complex matter depending	upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his	social-class experience there probably are some general statements about	social-class background and educational policy that can be made with	a fair degree of truth.	3.9341773152747255
1124. teachers who have been upward mobile	probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves	students as it has served them; that is they are likely to favor	a kind of education that has vocational-advancement value.	4.802316766292481
1125. this does	not necessarily	mean that such teachers will favor vocational education	as contrasted with liberal education but they are likely to favor	an approach to liberal education which has a maximal vocational-advancement	value as against a kind of pure liberal education that	is not designed to help people get better jobs.	3.4143560081262843
1126. there is no doubt	that higher education since world war 2 has moved away from	pure liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and	specialization.	5.725418088159881
1127. there are several causes for this one being rapid economic	development with increasing numbers of middle-class positions	requiring engineering or scientific training.	4.009321180960533
1128. but another cause may	lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their	own use of education as a means of social advancement.	5.8016960351204965
1129. compared	with the college and university faculty members of the period from	1900 to 1930 the new postwar faculty members consist of more children	of immigrants and more children	of urban working-class fathers.	3.8800408829640185
1130. their experience is quite in contrast	with that of children of upper- and upper-middle-class native-born	parents who are more likely to regard education as good for its own	sake and to discount the vocational emphases in the curriculum.	4.54885249196087
1131. public interest groups	educational policies are formed by	several groups who are officially or unofficially appointed to act in	the public interest.	3.8121340258085743
1132. legislators are one such group and state legislators	have major responsibility for educational legislation.	5.649605913938559
1133. they generally	vote so as to serve their own constituency and if the constituency	should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class they might	be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class interests	in education.	3.477711247506952
1134. however there are relatively few such political constituencies	and as has been pointed out there is seldom a clear-cut distinction	between the educational interests of one social class and those	of another.	5.210342038013889
1135. another public interest group is the commission	of laymen or educators which is appointed to study an educational problem	and to make recommendations.	3.652247144328763
1136. generally these commissions work	earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society as they conceive	it.	6.960141060433406
1137. nevertheless their conclusions and recommendations cannot	please everybody and they often represent a particular economic or political	point of view.	3.8939467178917018
1138. for instance there have been two presidential	commissions on higher education since world war 2.	6.622167389429023
1139. president	truman's commission on higher education tended to take a liberal	expansionist position while president eisenhower's committee	on education beyond the high school was slightly more conservative.	3.7812921818627228
1140. both commissions consisted of upper-middle- and upper-class people	who attempted to act in the public interest.	6.611486867188953
1141. an example of a	more definite class bias is noted in proceedings of the commission on	the financing of higher education sponsored by the association of	american universities and supported by the rockefeller foundation	and the carnegie corporation.	3.693106487093228
1142. this commission recommended against	the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities	and against a broad program of government-supported scholarships.	5.080754145439971
1143. this might be said to be an upper- or an upper-middle-class bias	but the commission published as one of its staff studies a book by	byron s hollingshead entitled who should go to college?	4.492295715953793
1144. 	which recommended a federal government scholarship program.	7.018067995812363
1145. furthermore	the commission set up the council for financial aid to education	as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support	of private higher education.	3.6749437235313565
1146. thus the commission acted with a	sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions	about the problem of government support to private education.	5.97914424132958
1147. then	there are the trustees and officers of the great educational foundations	who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by	their support or refusal to support various educational programs experiments	and demonstrations.	3.636677579144886
1148. these people are practically always upper-	or upper-middle-class persons who attempt to act in what they regard	as the interest of the entire society.	6.2652973090418
1149. finally there are	the parent organizations and the laymen's organizations such as the	national association of parents and teachers and the citizens committee	on public schools.	3.65611431509837
1150. these have an upper-middle-class leadership	and a middle-class membership with rare exceptions where working-class	parents are active in local p-ta matters.	5.1441790704227675
1151. like	the	other policy-making groups these are middle class in their educational	attitudes and they attempt to act in the general public interest	as they see it.	4.004088165621859
1152. in general it appears that educational decisions	and educational policies are made by people who intend to act in the	interests of the society as a whole.	5.190552543204629
1153. they are predominantly middle-	and upper-class people and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes	of those classes.	4.1972313670224155
1154. they may be unaware of the existence of lower-class	values and consequently fail to take them into account.	6.556773629519115
1155. but there	is very little frank and conscious espousal of the interests of any one	social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education.	4.344111772011876
1156. they think of themselves as trustees for the entire society	and try to serve the entire society.	6.085308722384755
1157. structure through education	educational policy in the united states	has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural	opportunity.	4.313051525428185
1158. in so far as this goal is achieved the society becomes more	fluid artificial barriers to social mobility are reduced and people	at the lower end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the	material	and cultural goods of society.	5.102368364508878
1159. on the other hand there is a counterbalancing	purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages	of the parents to their children.	4.698325861340948
1160. this leads to efforts at exclusiveness	through private schools and to the maintenance of social stratification	in the schools.	6.477867040413868
1161. both of these purposes exist side by side without much	overt conflict under present conditions.	4.859856438093508
1162. cultural opportunity	the broad expansion of free education results	both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society	and in promoting fluidity within the social structure.	4.833590412200479
1163. fifty years	ago the general raising of the school-leaving age to sixteen was an	example of this movement.	3.854614307350475
1164. during the past decade the program has been	carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities	state colleges and community colleges.	5.830005815047824
1165. the reaffirmation of	american faith in the comprehensive high school as expressed in the	conant study is another indication of the liveliness of the ideal of	maximizing opportunity through the equalizing of educational opportunity.	3.4292420366822935
1166. the recent federal government's student-loan program is	another step in the direction of making higher education more available	to lower-status youth.	5.144647537763863
1167. it is probably more effective than the expanded	scholarship programs of the past decade because the scholarship programs	mainly aided the students with the best academic records	and these students tended to use the scholarship	funds to go to more expensive colleges.	4.076048940280131
1168. meanwhile the private	colleges have increased their tuition rates so much that they have raised	an economic barrier which dwarfs their scholarship funds.	5.543275578881604
1169. the gains	in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place	largely in the publicly supported institutions.	3.7736565576091383
1170. unfortunately however and for reasons to be discussed in the	following chapter no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory	as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal	costs in order to yield adequate revenues.	5.4275567597132275
1171. and this fact may explain	some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational	formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units	of service.	4.018510822924177
1172. one such disagreement which will receive attention in	this next chapter concerns the question whether rates for different kinds	of service in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination must	be made directly proportional to marginal costs or whether they	should be based instead on differences in marginal costs.	4.722930920178437
1173. here	the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma.	4.498712506154132
1174. of fully distributed cost analysis	despite	an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define relative costs	the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as	far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice.	4.7087855522549855
1175. for more explicit expositions one must distinguish different types	of analyses.	4.644835509704905
1176. by all means the most important distinction is that	between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution	of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental	or marginal costs and those other apportionments which recognize no	difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution.	4.593213431371614
1177. the first or double-step type might also be called the railroad	type because of its application to railroads	by the cost section of the interstate commerce	commission.	3.931630645740919
1178. the cost section distinguishes between	variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding	chapter.	5.565931630107686
1179. the variable costs alone are assigned to the different units	of freight traffic as representing long-run out-of-pocket costs-	a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of	the economist's long-run marginal costs.	3.143553233927673
1180. there remains a residue	of total costs or total revenue requirements which since	it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations	in traffic density is strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis.	5.185161118441779
1181. nevertheless because the cost section has felt impelled to make	some kind of a distribution of total costs it has apportioned this residue	which it sometimes calls burden among the units of carload	traffic on a basis which is concededly	quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination.	3.292346108964108
1182. in recent	years this burden	has amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements	which the carload freight business is supposed to be called upon to	meet.	6.027200358663851
1183. since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad	rates it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff	of the interstate commerce commission has estimated out-of-pocket	costs and apportioned residue costs.	3.761441832793102
1184. suffice it to say that the usefulness	of the latter apportionment is questionable.	6.790170269910362
1185. but in any event	full credit should be given to the cost section for its express and	overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost	analyses: namely that between a cost allocation designed to	reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates	of output of different classes of utility service; and a mere cost apportionment	which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service	even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint	of specific cost determination.	3.1720837735113543
1186. we turn	now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which unlike the railroad	type draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost	apportionment: the single-step type.	4.836295803481763
1187. it might be called the public	utility type because of the considerable use to which it has	been put in gas and electric utility rate cases.	4.364203323664641
1188. here no attempt is	made first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose	on these costs reasonably distributed residues of total	costs.	5.345884659440842
1189. instead all of the total costs are treated as variable costs	although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be	functions of different variables.	4.219591027553615
1190. moreover whereas in interstate commerce	commission parlance variable cost means a cost deemed to	vary in direct proportion to changes in rate of output in the type	of analysis now under review variable cost has been used more	broadly so as to cover costs which while a function of some one variable	are not necessarily	a linear function.	4.409129189821753
1191. as already noted in an earlier	paragraph the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or	utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes	of service such as residential commercial industrial power street	lighting etc.	3.5170948878675072
1192. this grand division permits many costs to be	assigned in their entirety to some one class such as street lighting	or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes.	4.525521794907778
1193. high-tension industrial power service for example would not	be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of	the low-tension distribution lines.	3.6923717874218487
1194. but the major portions of the total	costs of a utility business are common or joint to all or nearly	all classes of customers; and these costs must somehow be apportioned	among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among	the units of service in order to report unit costs than can serve	as tentative measures of reasonable rates.	4.456504569366722
1195. the general basis on	which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units	of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem	of an electric-utility cost analysis.	3.3974106709633762
1196. but before turning to this	example we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis both of which belong	to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type.	5.096101245472936
1197. in the first subtype the analyst	distributes both total operating	costs and total annual capital costs	among the different	classes and units of service.	4.056733908477134
1198. here an apportionment say of $5000000	of the total costs to residential service as a class would include	an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital	is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential consumers.	5.215217809084992
1199. but in the second subtype which i take to be the one	more frequently applied only the operating expenses and not the cost	of capital or fair return are apportioned directly among the	various classes of service.	4.0101999995290925
1200. to be sure the capital investments in	the plant and	equipment are apportioned among the different classes as are also the	gross revenues received from the sales of the different services.	5.572559050524201
1201. but	any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service	over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as a return	realized on the capital investment attributed to the same	service.	3.413929003587667
1202. thus during any given year if the revenues from the residential	service are $7000000 if the operating expenses imputed	to this class of service come to $5000000 and if the net investment	in the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this	service amounts to $30000000 the cost analyst will report that residential	service in the aggregate has yielded a return of $2000000	or 6-23 per cent.	4.329890478279901
1203. other services will show different rates of return	some probably much lower and some higher.	4.1750091431224465
1204. there are obvious	reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding cost of capital	from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different	classes of service- notably the avoidance of the controversial question	what rate of return should be held to constitute cost of capital	or fair rate of return.	4.384907925792923
1205. but the practice is likely to be	misleading since it may seem to support a conclusion that as long	as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating	expenses plus some return on capital investment however low the	rates of charge for this service are compensatory.	3.4623171880233605
1206. needless to say any	such inference would be quite unwarranted.	6.769718008151315
1207. for the reason just	suggested i shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distributed	cost apportionment in the following simplified example.	5.043707603594667
1208. that	is to say an allowance for cost of capital will be assumed to	be included directly in the cost apportionment.	5.247937005978102
1209. of the costs of an electric utility business	in order to simplify	the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis let us	assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company	supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation	plant.	3.570369189694949
1210. let us also assume the existence of only one class or type	of service all of which is supplied at the same voltage phase etc	to residential commercial and industrial customers.	5.939081296438884
1211. this latter	assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial	aspect of modern public utility cost analysis- the distinction among	costs that are functions of outputs of the same service measured along	different dimensions.	3.491050228294954
1212. since the company under review is supplying	what we are here regarding as only one kind of service we might	suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very	simple; indeed that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual	operating and capital costs of the business followed by a calculation	of this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption.	5.227321603616179
1213. in fact however the problem is not so simple.	6.843887935127136
1214. for a statement	of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these	costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output of	energy.	6.460225829377114
1215. a recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required.	4.6123041055859675
1216. the simplest division and the one most frequently used	in gas and electric rate cases is a threefold division	of the total operating and capital costs into customer costs	energy or volumetric costs and demand or capacity	costs.	4.326934196762334
1217. if this threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart	in the actual rates of charge for service as it actually does	have in some rates there would result a three-part rate for any one	class of service.	3.3818342955725607
1218. for example the monthly bill of a residential	consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge a $5 charge for 250	kilowatt-hours of energy at 2 per kilowatt-hour and a $2 charge for	a maximum demand of 2 kilowatts during the month at the rate of $1	per kilowatt- a total bill of $8 for that month.	4.7412702822848845
1219. but our present interest	lies in the measurement of costs of service and only indirectly	in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs.	3.9571051350941757
1220. let	us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn recognizing	that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative	1.	5.459016426743698
1221. the	these are those operating and capital costs found to	vary with number of customers regardless or almost regardless of power	consumption.	3.5853166747464886
1222. included as a minimum are the costs of metering and	billing along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in	taking on another consumer.	4.980974843818544
1223. these minimum costs may come to $1 per month	more or less for residential and small commercial customers although	they are substantially higher for large industrial users who require	more costly connections and metering devices.	3.305411048061554
1224. while costs on this	order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial	rates in the form of a mere service charge they are more	frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which entitles	the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further	payment.	4.707196764903732
1225. but the really controversial aspect of customer-cost	imputation arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice	of including not just those costs that can be definitely earmarked	as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial	fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary	distribution system- a fraction equal to the estimated	annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity.	3.5005173873722897
1226. the preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined	by the sociologist.	5.315964723648707
1227. like primitive numbers in mathematics the entire	axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth.	4.082327117842232
1228. but what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces	the idea of physical models?	6.252536650363732
1229.  is it not the task of philosophy	to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred	canons in social science?	4.561345889944897
1230.  it has become painfully clear that the	very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by	erecting mathematical and physical models is itself a conditioned response	to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation.	5.133455618860208
1231. this push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the	measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led	sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word mass to	mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals	in such a group can be studied.	3.5904180577748748
1232. here i think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent.	8.935366448652028
1233. the simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs	to be questioned.	4.384178407776324
1234. for if the small group notion involves the implicit	claim that the phenomena of sociological investigations are of atomic	or subatomic proportions the philosopher needs to know the extent to	which such entities are valid.	4.7763413534679815
1235. the mere exploration of the unconscious	ground of present-day sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical	and logical investigation.	3.524748360352699
1236. a parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation	between perceptions experientially received and conceptions logically	formed.	5.709730075786378
1237. philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection	of socially viable categories.	4.183724846816929
1238. this involves a sifting of the	empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement.	5.324973543451586
1239. merton's functional sociology may have great practical use in	the study of different cultures yet it is perfectly clear as nagel	and hempel indicate that the concept	of function in sociology has been built up from physiological and biological	models in which the notions of teleology ie metaphysical	purpose are central.	3.3648418852891857
1240. functionalism as	a sociological credo is therefore not a direct consequence of observations	but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical inference	and judgment.	4.861416487662795
1241. the purpose of this sort of philosophical study	of sociology is not to tyrannize but to clarify the principles of social	science.	4.524674613226357
1242. it is absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise	to sociology since the former is a logical rational discipline	where sociology is essentially descriptive and empirical.	4.7840025255950644
1243. such a position	entails the negation of philosophy in its platonic form as something	soaring above and embracing the empirical and mathematical sciences.	3.851512634733071
1244. but contrary to whitehead philosophy is not a synonym for plato.	7.14575098674348
1245. the uses of philosophy as a logical clearing house are manifest to	any approach that does not descend to pure sensationalism.	3.5525458653904165
1246. however	when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences to dictate the	conditions of empirical research	it becomes formal metaphysics; shaping	the contours of life to fit the needs of legends.	4.933129465225603
1247. the notion of philosophy	as queen bee may fit well with authoritarian modes of political	ideology but it has been noted that the price of such an imperial	notion of philosophy is the frustration and flagellation of the social	sciences.	3.6944056340151534
1248. metaphysics is no longer a direct grappling with	nature as it was in antiquity.	7.707991075760193
1249. it has surrendered any claims of description	in favor of psychological accounts of nothingness as in heidegger's	system.	4.269053541813577
1250. science is mocked for wishing to know nothing	of nothing in a last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense	of men.	5.299758794610663
1251. it is not positivism which has isolated metaphysics from reality	by distinguishing between description and prescription.	4.389819344796451
1252. it is	simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during	this century.	6.134209630398473
1253. consider the traditional four fields	of philosophy: logic ethics epistemology and esthetics.	4.748063191433491
1254. it is a	commonplace that to the degree these special preserves of past philosophic	hunting grounds establish an empirical content and suitable methodological	criteria they move away from philosophy as such.	4.790385844261628
1255. what is left	to traditional systems of philosophy is in effect only the history	of these fields prior to their becoming rigorous enough to abide by	the canons of scientific method.	3.6434658960302064
1256. in this situation philosophy has survived	by separating itself from metaphysics by showing the ultimate	questions to be the meaningless questions.	6.230689930210691
1257. the relinquishing	by philosophy of pretentious claims to empirical priority gives it an	ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was	unable to examine because of its missionary attitude to knowledge of	more humble sorts.	3.5044609128962736
1258. in the new situation philosophy is able to provide	the social sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers	the physical sciences a reservoir of logical relations that can be used	in framing hypotheses having explanatory and predictive value.	5.402308408967359
1259. beyond	this philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the	type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry	but within its potential domain of relevance.	3.305507658629995
1260. in this connection	it might be noted that the theory of games was a mathematical discovery	long before its uses in political science were exploited.	5.717177914147039
1261. likewise	kant formulated the nebular hypothesis according to which the solar	system was evolved from a rotating mass of incandescent gas nearly	a half century before its scientific value was made plain by laplace	in his systeme du monde.	3.2777585986067614
1262. this does not mean that philosophy resolves	the problems it generates any more so than riemann's geometry	settled the physical status of the space-time continuum.	5.66925600205114
1263. but the forceful	presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself	a monumental task.	4.375903609354613
1264. to those raised on marcel's homo viator	and heidegger's das nichtige this may seem a modest	role for philosophy.	5.428710120265365
1265. however modesty and triviality are different qualities.	5.639697117185739
1266. philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear	as less dramatic than philosophy which jeers as the sciences evolve.	4.921799732081023
1267. the ceaseless effort to understand and measure the distance mankind	has traversed since its primitive anthropological status offers a	more durable sort of drama.	3.3346229150855904
1268. by clarifying fundamental premises in the	social sciences and defining the logical problems emergent at the borderlands	of each new scientific discipline philosophy can offer the	sort of distinction that can accelerate growth in human understanding.	4.567937208189222
1269. philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful	and self-content by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis	or theory is framed.	3.5017130628491975
1270. the dissection of scientific theory the examination	of a theory from the vantage-points of language epistemology	and ethics is itself a distinct contribution to knowledge no less	so because of its removal from empirical research.	4.481563096107372
1271. the realm	of science whatever the degree of precision in formulations covers	the range of prediction and explanation.	3.797846346869032
1272. whatever philosophy is conceived to be its rationalist	logistic attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is	something other than science.	5.342340649824489
1273. for some forms of philosophy this very	division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the	metaphysical superiority of the latter.	3.9424929582650816
1274. bergson and leroy announce	that the secret is the center of a philosophy and thereafter a	hundred followers declare secrecy a higher verity.	5.55810254189902
1275. this is simply a	confession of intellectual sterility spruced up to look virtuous.	4.675400385809556
1276. for	as merleau-ponty indicated it is not the secret which is important	but the removal of secrecy.	7.173880809239864
1277. in this philosophy and science	share a common goal.	5.551942749237131
1278. the hypostatization of the secret nonetheless guarantees	that the division of analytical and synthetic philosophies shall	not be overcome by even the most persuasive argument; for this	division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between	mysticism and science.	4.5070445166384125
1279. the mystification of metaphysical systems	does not imply the demise of philosophy only the close of a philosophic	age which demanded metaphysics to be rational and logical.	3.3581575098026293
1280. the	tenacity with which present metaphysical attitudes fetishize private	intuition offers the strongest evidence that the gulf between scientific	and delphic ways of philosophizing is built into the present conflict	over the limits and purpose of science religion and ideology.	4.599263099505115
1281. scientific systems and this includes even	the relation of mechanist to relativist physics are built upon refined	and corrected.	3.685338251241182
1282. philosophic systems by the very nature of their completeness	are overthrown by rival systems.	5.448482501884564
1283. in addition to the incompleteness	of science and the completeness of metaphysics they differ	in that science is essentially descriptive while philosophy in its inherited	forms tends to be goal-oriented teleological and prescriptive.	3.7762803031952443
1284. the threadbare notion that belief unlike behaviour is not subject	to objective analysis has placed intuitive metaphysics squarely against	the sociology of knowledge since it is precisely the job of the	sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less viable	than social behaviour.	4.441234880047013
1285. when dealing with the actual relation	of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge or better the role of philosophy	in assisting research on the social sources of ideas one has	to become necessarily selective.	3.750283997906289
1286. certain features we have touched upon:	philosophy as a logical deductive system from which a social science	methodology can be built up; philosophic analysis of the assumptions	and presumptions of the social sciences; and philosophy as a	guide to possible integration of supposedly disparate sociological	investigations.	4.575020791301244
1287. the objection will be raised that the most important	role of philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted	namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms operative in	the social sciences.	3.398703293886957
1288. specifically it will be asked whether the real	questions people ask are not the ultimate questions that	social science finds itself impotent in the face of.	5.907297530710235
1289. what then is the	status of such questions as: is society the ground of human existence	or a means to an individual goal?	3.9538501814140767
1290.  do societies develop according	to cosmic patterns or are they subject only to the free choice of individuals?	6.28447833641081
1291. 	does society really exist as an entity over and above the	agglomeration of men?	4.0625963844172945
1292.  i think it must be said that contrary to metaphysical	insistence these are questions so framed as to defy either	empirical exploration or rational solutions.	6.322908159914021
1293. as simmel and dilthey	indicated questions of whether the value of life is individual	or social are not questions but assertions of faith made to	appear as legitimate questions.	3.8076517447164817
1294. such pseudo-questions assume that answers	of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving	undefined universals.	5.90479764701823
1295. social theory has no more right to expect results	from meaningless questions than physics has the right to expect a	theological solution to the wave-particle controversy.	3.9819390801322805
1296. it is not	that such questions are not asked.	7.074602800483028
1297. it is rather that introducing them	into social analysis reflects not so much a search for truth as for	certainty.	4.337830399501776
1298. an operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract	certainty since it is certainty which every new discovery in science	either replaces or reshapes.	5.263759843735694
1299. to raise the added objection that	men require certainty on psychological grounds answers to ultimate questions	having an irrational rather than scientific basis is in a real	sense to undermine the objection itself.	3.6279891416970553
1300. for what concerns all scientific	disciplines is precisely that which can be captured for the rational	ie for the scientific determination of what in past ages	was considered ultimate and irrational.	4.976590877890066
1301. a philosophy which attempts	to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its acquiescence	in the shortcomings of men an impatience with partial tentative	solutions.	3.41756403073522
1302. men have always lived in a tentative world and in suspension	of ultimate judgments where and when necessary.	5.320657010299
1303. uncertainty	overcoming itself is the precondition of the quest for new and more precise	information about the world.	3.744109221929566
1304. without such uncertainty we are left	with a set of dogmas and myths.	6.3114125112818735
1305. the functional interplay of philosophy	and science should as a minimum guarantee a meaningful option to	myth-making.	3.5177069743400518
1306. a degree of indefiniteness is a salutary condition	for the growth of science.	6.547992755289203
1307. but neither was the statement empirical for goodness was not a quality	like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard.	4.171385919229352
1308. what were they to	do then with these awkward judgments of value?	6.55594565143
1309.  to find a place for	them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the	theory radically and yet that theory was what they regarded as their	most important discovery.	3.719721129900602
1310. it appeared that the theory could be saved	in one way only.	6.453640678187258
1311. if it could be shown that judgments of good and bad	were not judgments at all that they asserted nothing true or false but	merely expressed emotions like hurrah or fiddlesticks	then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads	could be at rest.	3.4527647253142164
1312. this is the course the positivists took.	8.550793989234048
1313. they	explained value judgments by explaining them away.	4.913686410369733
1314. now i do not	think their view will do.	7.221770781015989
1315. but before discussing it i should like	to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they	have stated their case.	3.6577863208093446
1316. it has been said of john stuart mill that	he wrote so clearly that he could be found out.	6.826115980331924
1317. this theory has been	put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind	and this i will do my best to supply.	3.8622812658207755
1318. the theory claims to show	by analysis that when we say that is good we do not mean to assert	a character of the subject of which we are thinking.	6.0126179256494074
1319. i shall argue	that we do mean to do just that.	4.923627133979476
1320. let us work through an example	and the simpler and commoner the better.	6.4036930417443205
1321. there is perhaps no value	statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement	that intense pain is bad.	4.060696930666786
1322. let us take a set of circumstances	in which i happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which	i think every one of us might naturally make such a statement.	5.237446177827718
1323. we	come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal traps in	common use.	4.8483774848796966
1324. there are signs that it has struggled for days to escape	and that in a frenzy of hunger pain and fear it has all but eaten	off its own leg.	5.549264593006686
1325. the attempt failed: the animal is now dead.	4.1174608023645085
1326. as we	think of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffered we are	very	likely to say: it was a bad thing that the little animal should	suffer so.	5.877423432851416
1327. the positivist tells us that when we say this we are	only expressing our present emotion.	3.916273114916166
1328. i hold on the contrary that we	mean to assert something of the pain itself namely that it was bad-	bad when and as it occurred.	6.233852449484805
1329. consider what follows from the	positivist view.	6.235853019480706
1330. on that view nothing good or bad happened in the case	until i came on the scene and made my remark.	5.943481977627696
1331. for what i express	in my remark is something going on in me at the time and that of course	did not exist until i did come on the scene.	4.149703090441274
1332. the pain of the rabbit	was not itself bad; nothing evil was happening when that pain was	being endured; badness in the only sense in which it is involved	at all waited for its appearance till i came and looked and felt.	4.4474557468268605
1333. now	that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows.	4.054829974129361
1334. let	us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene	and that the rabbit never was discovered.	5.206670624488652
1335. are we prepared to say that	in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did?	4.708497460530092
1336. 	clearly not.	11.155741451300253
1337. indeed we should say on the contrary that the accident	of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness	of the animal's pain that it would have been every whit as bad	whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel	repugnance or not.	3.7019538309955085
1338. if so then it is clear that in saying the suffering	was bad we are not expressing our feelings only.	7.240706951628241
1339. we are saying that	the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an	attitude toward it.	4.188269530351857
1340. the first argument is thus an ideal experiment	in which we use the method of difference.	6.053976238528385
1341. it removes our present	expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected	by this whereas on positivist grounds it should be.	3.9288583812674824
1342. the second argument	applies the method in the reverse way.	6.348605984352703
1343. it ideally removes the past	event and shows that this would render false what we mean to say	whereas on positivist grounds it should not.	3.769088358767678
1344. let us suppose that the	animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all but	that we mistakenly believe it did and say as before that its suffering	was an evil thing.	4.885763505560025
1345. on the positivist theory everything i sought	to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in	the second.	4.184297582041247
1346. in the only sense in which badness is involved at all whatever	was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety since	all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling and that	feeling is still there.	4.949838089834464
1347. and our question is is such an implication	consistent with what we meant?	4.417631112978637
1348.  clearly it is not.	8.611662735987945
1349. if anyone asked	us after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing whether	we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident	had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all we should	say that it made all the difference in the world that what we were	asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred	back there that if this had not occurred there was nothing left to	be bad and that our assertion was in that case mistaken.	3.217766676891373
1350. the suggestion	that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making	no mistake because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about	the past suffering seems to me merely frivolous.	4.496907258967555
1351. if we did not mean	to say this why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering	had not occurred?	4.316761878999076
1352.  on the theory before us such relief would be	groundless for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all	and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved	about.	5.130759431050938
1353. the positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition.	3.873635296338494
1354. so far as i can see there is only one way out for	the positivist.	8.905178539105679
1355. he holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of	approval or disapproval.	4.1911869590167825
1356. and there is a way in which he might hold	that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval	without belonging to the pain itself.	6.7764674394968285
1357. the pain in itself was neutral;	but unfortunately the rabbit on no grounds at all took up toward	this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for the	first time and in the only intelligible sense bad.	3.3667025629408696
1358. this way of escape	is theoretically possible but since it has grave difficulties of	its own and has not so far as i know been urged by positivists it	is perhaps best not to spend time over it.	4.982023073555635
1359. i come now to a third	argument which again is very simple.	4.484892654201212
1360. when we come upon the rabbit	and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing we presumably	make it with some feeling; the positivists are plainly right in	saying that such remarks do usually express feeling.	4.688281123779224
1361. but suppose that	a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement	again.	3.9238037088949635
1362. and suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that	the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded.	5.725724764308343
1363. the pathetic evidence is no longer before us; and we are now	so	fatigued in body and mind that feeling is as we say quite dead.	3.5078766839836955
1364. in	these circumstances since what was expressed by the remark when first	made is on the theory before us simply absent the remark now expresses	nothing.	5.1780893243363
1365. it is as empty as the word hurrah would be when	there was no enthusiasm behind it.	4.47955677267829
1366. and this seems to me untrue.	12.083317993592468
1367. when	we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing the feeling	with which we made it last week may be at or near the vanishing point	but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before we	should certainly answer yes.	3.2516340484471558
1368. we should say that we made our point	with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time	but that it was the same point we were making.	6.379001010360919
1369. and if we can see that	what we meant to say remains the same while the feeling varies from	intensity to near zero it is not the feeling that we primarily meant	to express.	4.424398338869177
1370. i come now to a fourth consideration.	7.416456048017054
1371. we all believe	that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting	and another not; but on the theory before us such a belief would	not make sense.	3.5428951675742453
1372. broad and ross have lately contended that this fitness	is one of the main facts of ethics and i suspect they are right.	5.680696805098834
1373. but that is not exactly my point.	7.769853085575301
1374. my point is this: whether there	is such fitness or not we all assume that there is and if we do we	express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do.	5.815328331261841
1375. in his novel the house of the dead dostoevsky	tells of his experiences in a siberian prison camp.	4.533389412889567
1376. whatever	the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today dostoevsky's companions	were about as grim a lot as can be imagined.	4.974721602647297
1377. i have heard	stories he writes of the most terrible the most unnatural actions	of the most monstrous murders told with the most spontaneous	childishly merry laughter.	4.311138828538035
1378. most of us would say that in this delight	at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something	very unfitting.	5.851365982269058
1379. if we were asked why we thought so we should say	that these things involve great evil and are wrong and that to take	delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting.	3.5340083374358353
1380. now on the subjectivist	view this answer is ruled out.	7.494111835198144
1381. for before someone takes	up an attitude toward death suffering or their infliction they have	no moral quality at all.	3.808111655267625
1382. there is therefore nothing about them to which	an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting.	5.79541564082568
1383. they are	in themselves neutral and so far as they get a moral quality they	get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the onlooker.	4.30415535764297
1384. but if that is true why is any attitude more fitting than any	other?	6.538683490939709
1385.  would applause for example be fitting if apart from the	applause there were nothing good to applaud?	4.110694365975598
1386.  would condemnation be	fitting if independently of the condemnation there were nothing bad	to condemn?	6.081364918883422
1387.  in such a case any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting	as any other which means that the notion of fitness has lost	all point.	4.026304398651889
1388. indeed we are forced to go much farther.	8.061855390659169
1389. if goodness	and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being	by them those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry	laughter are taking the only sensible line.	3.4634156662544706
1390. if there is nothing evil	in these things if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling	about them why shouldn't they be greeted with a cheer?	5.583985982299739
1391.  to greet	them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something	bad; it would needlessly bring badness into the world; and even	on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright.	3.7168074654908763
1392. on the	other hand to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral	into something good; it would bring goodness into the world.	5.170646421208672
1393. the injured german veteran was a former miner twenty-four years	old who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head.	4.1404589560665945
1394. this	resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left	side of the cerebellum also.	5.342387668272994
1395. in any event the extraordinary result	of this injury was that he became psychically blind while at	the same time apparently the sense of touch remained essentially intact.	4.259686581521102
1396. psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence	of visual memory-images a condition in which for example one	is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture	of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence.	4.628190204722479
1397. this circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual	capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its	exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented	by the authors is overwhelming that when the patient closed his eyes	he had absolutely no spatial awareness	whatsoever.	3.402551849403859
1398. the necessary inference as the authors themselves interpret	it would seem to be this:  spatial qualities are not among	those grasped by the sense of touch as such.	5.212950117472659
1399. we do not arrive	at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself.	5.802510507473161
1400. spatiality becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual	representations; that is there is in the true sense only a visual	space.	6.170706796099078
1401. the underlying assumption of course is that only	sight and touch enable us in any precise and fully dependable way to	locate objects in space beyond us the other senses being decidedly inferior	if not totally inadequate in this regard.	3.171300642905134
1402. this is an assumption	with which few would be disposed to quarrel.	7.059986346228397
1403. therefore if the sense	of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence	of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind person when the eyes are closed	and an object is handled the conclusion seems unavoidable that	touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality	of things and that actual sight or visual representations are	necessary.	3.479601734744262
1404. the force of the authors' analysis	can be felt by the reader i believe only after three	questions have been successfully answered.	4.817440253069936
1405. what allows us to think	that the patient had no third-dimensional representations when his	eyes were closed?	4.1320577981747535
1406.  what evidence is there that he was psychically	blind?	8.761683313127063
1407.  how can we be sure that his sense of touch was not profoundly	disturbed by his head injury?	5.016141163795102
1408.  we shall consider these in the	inverse order of their presentation.	7.632852027176722
1409. obviously a satisfactory	answer to the third question is imperative if the argument is to	get under way at all for if there is any possibility of doubt whether	the patient's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital	lesion any findings whatsoever in regard to the first question become	completely ambiguous and fail altogether of course as evidence to	establish the desired conclusion.	3.4332785084695168
1410. the answer the authors give to it	therefore is of supreme importance.	5.909992702190124
1411. it is as follows: the usual	sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness	as well as the kinesthetic	sensations	were	as such essentially intact although they seemed in comparison with	normal reactions to be somewhat diminished over the entire body.	3.626404008720263
1412. the	supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient	and his ability to specify the location of a member as well as	the direction and scope of a movement passively executed	proved to have been on the contrary very considerably	affected.	4.936013827434319
1413. the authors insist however that these abnormalities in	the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that	sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained	to the sense of sight.	3.3312647724994235
1414. first of all what is their evidence	that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged?	6.475003965915252
1415.  when	an object was placed in the patient's hand he had no difficulty determining	whether it was warm or cold sharp or blunt rough or smooth	flexible soft or hard; and he could tell simply by the feel of	it whether it was made of wood iron cloth rubber and so on.	3.5301680971452702
1416. and	he could recognize by touch alone articles which he had handled immediately	before even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and	could not be identified by him; that is he was unaware what kind	of objects they were or what their use was.	4.650613067151248
1417. the patient attained	an astonishing efficiency in a new trade.	4.761539108782989
1418. because of his brain injury	and the extreme damage suffered to his sight the patient had to train	himself for a new line of work that of a portfolio-maker an occupation	requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements	and a fairly well-developed sense of form and contour.	5.277254074777458
1419. it seems clear	when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight	of the patient	second question the one concerning the psychical blindness of the	that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the	usual portfolio-maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably	more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal	vision.	3.683260622881126
1420. and so the authors conclude: the conduct of the patient	in his every-day life and in his work even more than the foregoing	facts mentioned above under 1 leave positively no room for doubt	that the sense of touch in the ordinary sense of the word was unaffected;	or to put the same thing in physiological terms that the performance-capacity	of the tactual apparatus from the periphery up to	the tactual centers in the brain- that is from one end to the other-	was unimpaired.	5.0824988897198855
1421. if the argument is accepted as essentially	sound up to this point it remains for us to consider whether the	patient's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating	objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his defective	visual condition.	3.4983204149252574
1422. but before we can do this we must first find	answers to our original questions 1 and 2; then we shall perhaps	be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question	at hand.	4.993272603087147
1423. in what ways then did the patient's psychical	blindness manifest itself?	5.127490357762003
1424.  he could not see objects as unified	self-contained and organized figures as a person does with normal	vision.	5.9726897881660586
1425. the meaning of this as we shall see is that he had no fund	of visual memory-images of objects as objects; and therefore he could	not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again.	3.9985733796125564
1426. instead	he constantly became lost in parts and components of them confused	some of their details with those of neighboring objects and so	on unless he allowed time to trace the object in question through	minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover	its contours.	4.828147170080248
1427. according to his own testimony he never actually saw things	as shaped but only as generally amorphous blots of color of	a more or less indefinite size; at their edges they slipped pretty	much out of focus altogether.	3.784132284836197
1428. but by the tracing procedure he could	in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner find the unseen form; could	piece as it were the jumbled mass together into an organized whole	and then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned	out to be.	5.002549805992996
1429. if however the figure to be discerned were complicated	composed of several interlocking subfigures and so on even the tracing	process failed him and he could not focus even relatively simple	shapes among its parts.	3.865538895849671
1430. this meant concretely that the patient could	not read at all without making writing-like movements of the head or	body became easily confused by hasher marks inserted between hand-written	words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters and	could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing	it.	4.781064002705794
1431. the patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery	at all; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate	him.	4.161266947459228
1432. after a conversation with another man he was able to	recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe	at all what the other man looked like.	5.624654875704367
1433. nor could he call up memory-pictures	of close friends or relatives.	4.855983384186121
1434. in short both his own declarations	and his figural blindness when he looked at objects seem to	present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all.	5.230412469410792
1435. he was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed precisely	because he could not assign it to a visual shape already learned	and held in visual memory as persons of normal vision do.	3.7739164808233205
1436. he could	not recognize it; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he	had no visual memory at all.	5.283679429006797
1437. therefore his only recourse was to learn	the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same	individual object or type of object; and this he could do only by	going over its mass with the tracing procedure.	3.434870062139693
1438. then he might finally	recognize it apparently by combining the visual blot actually being	seen with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing	movements.	5.348707445267842
1439. this would mean it can readily be seen that again	for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have to be repeated	because of the absence of visual imagery.	4.264243148924552
1440. as one would	surmise the procedure however could be repeated with the same object	or with the same type of object often enough so that the corresponding	visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would	provide clues as to the actual shape which the patient then immediately	could determine by a kind of inference.	5.391927550266189
1441. men trees automobiles	houses and so on- objects continually confronted in everyday life-	had each its characteristic blot-appearance and became easily recognizable	at the very beginning of tracing by an inference as to what	each was.	3.327910791871167
1442. dice for example he inferred from black dots on a white surface.	5.583228874976599
1443. he evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects	but their size and the dots gave them away.	3.6606271074526586
1444. and the authors give	numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient's part to	show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself	and how proficient he became at it.	4.737647683286592
1445. often he seems even to have been	able to guess correctly without the tracing motions solely on the basis	of qualitative differences among the blot-like things which appeared	in his visual experience.	3.610843730724617
1446. perhaps the very important question-	what is then exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the	patient's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing	movements when he is actually looking at things?	5.59274811358886
1447. - has now been	raised in the reader's mind and in the following form.	4.993288923544662
1448. if the patient	can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually	then it would seem the sense of touch has immediate contact	with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations	at least in regard to two dimensions and as we shall see even	this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied	by the authors.	4.908216358855472
1449. how then do the kinesthetic sensations function in	all this?	5.110856747420545
1450.  the authors set about answering this fundamental question	through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability tactually	to perceive figure and to locate objects in space with his	eyes closed.	4.5165794708971365
1451. quite naturally	they make the investigation first by prohibiting the patient from	making any movements at all and then later by repeating it and allowing	the patient to move in any way he wanted to.	3.5279514395450384
1452. when the	patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all the following	striking results occurred.	5.6433060094885
1453. whenever artists indeed turned to actual representations or molded	three-dimensional figures which were rare down to 800 bc they	tended to reflect reality; a schematic	abstract treatment of men and animals by intent rose only in the	late eighth century.	3.2620920014693833
1454. to speak of this underlying view of the	world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment.	5.424576497194714
1455. at the least	however one may conclude that geometric potters sensed a logical order;	their principles of composition stand very close to those which	appear in the homeric epics and the hexameter line.	3.6351699296284106
1456. their world again	was a still simple traditional age which was only slowly beginning	to appreciate the complexity of life.	5.234692430010981
1457. and perhaps an observer of the	vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers	and users was basically stable and secure.	3.4734242005066274
1458. the storms of the past	had died away and the great upheaval which was to mark the following	century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds.	4.736980190795907
1459. throughout	the work of the later ninth century a calm severe serenity displays	itself.	4.642170373651449
1460. in the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel	one in its internal self-satisfaction but the best of the geometric	pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made	in the greek world.	5.029255248898825
1461. the ninth century was in its artistic work the	spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future	and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a	testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and	was appreciated.	3.2633753001217545
1462. geometric pottery	has not yet received the thorough detailed study which it	deserves	partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some	of its local manifestations as at argos are only now coming to light.	4.430252599841986
1463. from even a cursory inspection of its many aspects however the	historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress	of the aegean world down to 800 bc   the general intellectual	outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated	to a significant degree.	3.353117205890386
1464. much which was in embryo in 1000	had become reasonably well developed by 800.	6.011909400735214
1465. in this process the minoan-mycenaean	inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected;	the aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that	which	rises more clearly in our vision after 800.	3.600646178690562
1466. those modern scholars	who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of aegean	development from earliest times- granted occasional irruptions of	peoples and ideas from outside- are correct; but all too many observers	have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change	which took place in the early first millennium.	5.069105302743935
1467. the focus	of novelty in this world now lay in the south-eastern districts of	the	greek mainland and by 800 virtually the entire aegean always excepting	its northern shores had accepted the geometric style of pottery.	3.223975362041728
1468. while protogeometric vases usually turn up especially outside greece	proper together with as many or more examples of local stamp these	non-greek	patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century.	4.7374432564781275
1469. in their place came local variations within the common style-	tentative as it were in protogeometric products but truly distinct	and sharply defined as the geometric spirit developed.	3.703346274512804
1470. attica	though important was not the only teacher of this age.	7.468969078289562
1471. one can take	a vase of about 800 bc and without any knowledge of its place	of origin venture to assign it to a specific area; imitation and borrowing	of motifs now become ascertainable.	3.7311000669325636
1472. the potters of the aegean	islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland and in greece	itself argive corinthian attic boeotian and other geometric	sequences have each their own hallmarks.	4.698491365991988
1473. these local variations were	to become ever sharper in the next century and a half.	4.575152100200311
1474. the same	conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the dark	ages from linguistic distribution and from the survivals of early	social political and religious patterns into later ages.	4.796486184190882
1475. by 800 bc	the aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture.	4.301053212918184
1476. on these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which	was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the iliad.	5.133358438571595
1477. everywhere within the common pattern however one finds local	diversity; greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized	and plagued by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors.	3.483176568442931
1478. further we cannot go for the dark ages deserve their	name.	6.525021902668779
1479. many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized	to find expression nor could the simple economic and social foundations	of this world support a lofty structure.	3.8084711493347605
1480. the epic poems the	consolidation of the greek pantheon the rise of firm political units	the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations	of men- all these had to await the progress of following decades.	4.5249799175509
1481. what we have seen in this chapter we have seen only dimly and	yet the results however general are worth the search.	4.692921611994544
1482. these are	the centuries in which the inhabitants of the aegean world settled firmly	into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the	hellenic outlook independent of outside forces.	5.060922279763007
1483. to interpret	indeed the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation	may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed	information; if we could see more deeply we probably would find	many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the	period.	3.2677234042204715
1484. the historian can only point out those lines which were major	enough to find reflection in our limited evidence and must hope that	future excavations will enrich our understanding.	4.348637338786523
1485. throughout the dark	ages it is clear the greek world had been developing slowly but	consistently.	4.700920227833938
1486. the pace could now be accelerated for the inhabitants	of the aegean stood on firm ground.	4.866834029272085
1487. the landscape of greek history broadens widely and	rather abruptly in the eighth century bc the age of homer's	rosy-fingered dawn.	3.858252474554509
1488. the first slanting rays of the new day	cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the aegean world;	but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more	unmistakably some of the lines of change.	5.215701539100871
1489. for this period as for earlier	centuries pottery remains the most secure source; the ceramic	material of the age is more abundant more diversified and more indicative	of the hopes and fears of its makers who begin to show scenes of	human life and death.	3.3323474161071567
1490. figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence	of sculpture and architecture in greece; objects in gold	ivory	and bronze grow more numerous.	4.920292053327142
1491. since writing was practiced in the	aegean before the end of the century we may hope that the details of	tradition will now be occasionally useful.	4.5866356115173055
1492. though it is not easy to	apply the evidence of the iliad to any specific era this marvelous	product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape	by 750.	5.820769584137079
1493. the dipylon geometric pottery of athens and the iliad	are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of greek	civilization; but both were among the last products of a phase	which was ending.	3.190016931223357
1494. greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution	in which the developed qualities of the hellenic outlook were	suddenly to break forth.	4.980693831445578
1495. the revolution was well under way before	700 bc and premonitory signs go back virtually across the century.	3.5426346020047945
1496. the era however is janus-faced.	6.515217524219468
1497. while many tokens point forward	the main achievements stand as a culmination of the simple patterns	of the dark ages.	3.898553126248351
1498. the dominant pottery of the century was geometric;	political organization revolved about the basileis;	trade	was just beginning to expand; the gods who protected the greek countryside	were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress.	4.510075689387875
1499. the modern student who knows what was to come next is likely	to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth	century.	3.3604080464385486
1500. not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis.	8.326839055857713
1501. many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted	with radically new ideas; the poet of the iliad deliberately	archaized.	4.555421249036162
1502. although it is not possible to sunder old and new	in this era i shall consider in the present chapter primarily the	first	decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee	of the first stage of greek civilization.	5.299100566873155
1503. on this principle	of division i must postpone the evolution of sculpture architecture	society and politics; for the developments in these areas make sense	only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself.	3.8874224837932414
1504. the growing	contacts between aegean and orient are also a phase which should	be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of hellenic culture	after 750.	4.588401011371815
1505. we shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections	to the east as we consider ripe geometric pottery the epic	and the myth and the religious evolution of early greece; the important	point however is that these magnificent achievements unlike those	of later decades were only incidentally influenced by oriental	models.	3.31474303150348
1506. the antecedents of dipylon vases and of the iliad lie in	the aegean past.	5.617770194136463
1507. the pottery of the first	half of the eighth century is commonly called ripe geometric.	3.7177066918180417
1508. the	severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years the strong	geometric style of the late ninth century display as firm a mastery	of the principles underlying geometric pottery; but artists now were	ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance.	4.514765639494089
1509. the vases which resulted	had different shapes far more complex decoration and a larger	sense of style.	3.5177069743400518
1510. beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of	this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader	lines.	5.130592532161127
1511. in earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding	a fundamental sense of order after chaos.	4.161702952433732
1512. they had had to work on very	simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses.	6.207270016295885
1513. the	potters in particular had virtually eschewed freehand drawing elaborate	motifs and the curving lines of nature while yet expressing a	belief that there was order in the universe.	3.4867804025449143
1514. in their vases were embodied	the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of greek civilization	at first hesitantly in protogeometric work and then more confidently	in the initial stages of the geometric style.	4.870916868870414
1515. by 800 social	and cultural security had been achieved at least on a simple plane;	it was time to take bigger steps to venture on experiments.	3.745172113229767
1516. ripe	geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments	and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of	motifs which they had inherited.	5.210834845291727
1517. in these respects the vases of the early	eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress.	4.047881796609894
1518. to the ancestral lore however new materials were added.	7.384153110503286
1519. painters	left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color; instead they	divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns	into which freehand drawing began to creep.	3.352339000993367
1520. wavy lines feather-like	patterns rosettes of indefinitely floral nature birds either singly	or in stylized rows animals in solemn frieze bands-	all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary	signs that the potters were broadening their gaze.	4.677259010949875
1521. the rows of animals	and birds in particular suggest awareness of oriental animal friezes	transmitted perhaps via syrian silver bowls and textiles but the	specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are	nonetheless greek.	3.0736680476013656
1522. though the spread of this type of decoration in the	aegean has not yet been precisely determined it seems to appear first	in the cyclades which were among the leading exporters of pottery	throughout the century.	5.514838230965381
1523. as the material at the command of the	potters grew and the volume of their production increased the local	variations within a common style became more evident.	4.0214467117816115
1524. plate 12 illustrates	four examples which are ripe or late geometric work of common	spirit but of different schools.	5.057556181613073
1525. cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and	when he could not show the hide arrested him.	3.9628890065057316
1526. thinking the evidence	insufficient to get a conviction he later released him.	6.489179364434843
1527. even while suffering	the trip to his home cook swore to moore and lane that he	would kill the indian.	4.029440946165766
1528. three weeks later following his recovery	armed with a writ issued by the catskill justice on affidavits prepared	by the district attorney cook and russell rode to arrest martinez.	4.792661693966565
1529. arriving at daybreak they found julio in his corral and demanded	that he surrender.	4.046642206484951
1530. instead he whirled and ran to his house for	a gun forcing them to kill him cook reported.	5.736028134199097
1531. both cook's	and russell's lives were threatened by the mexicans following the	killing but the company officers felt that in the end it would serve	to quiet them despite their immediate emotion.	3.978839148619181
1532. general manager pels	even suggested that it might be wise to keep the mexicans in suspense	rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away and try	to have a few punished.	5.1143983611049375
1533. on february 17 russell and cook	were sent to the pena flor community on the vermejo to see about renting	out ranches the company had purchased.	3.85752953040993
1534. while talking with julian	m beall francisco archuleta and juan marcus appeared both	heavily armed and after watching the house for a while rode away.	5.704641709484443
1535. it was nearly sundown before they finished the business with beall and	began riding down the stream.	4.030960584550162
1536. they had traveled only a short distance	when they spotted five mexicans riding along a horse-trail across	the stream just ahead of them.	5.389114820617789
1537. suspecting an ambush the two deputies	decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into catskill.	3.632711015013689
1538. after spending two nights in catskill	the deputies again headed for the vermejo to finish their business.	5.87386878502588
1539. they stayed with a rancher friday night and by eleven o'clock	saturday morning passed the old garnett lee ranch.	3.8643139165915907
1540. half a mile below	at the mouth of salyer's canyon was an old ranch that the company	had purchased from a j armstrong occupied by a mexican	his wife and an old trapper.	5.108300524120971
1541. there were three houses in salyer's	canyon just at the foot of a low bluff the road winding along the top	entering above and then passing down in front of the houses thence	to the vermejo.	3.89556108685728
1542. to the west of this road was another low bluff forty	or fifty feet high covered with scrub oak and other brush.	5.851288890710507
1543. as they	were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the	two bluffs a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers.	3.50679684136116
1544. not a bullet touched cook who was nearer the ambush but one	hit russell in the leg and another broke his arm passing on through	his body.	5.1442218019664745
1545. with the first reports russell's horse wheeled	to the right and ran towards the buildings while cook followed by a	hail of bullets raced towards the arroyo of salyer's canyon immediately	in front of him just reaching it as his horse fell.	3.574973373544093
1546. grabbing	his winchester from its sheath cook prepared to fight from behind	the arroyo bank.	5.448482501884564
1547. bullets were so thick throwing sand in his face that	he found it difficult to return the fire.	3.783156528932715
1548. noticing russell's horse	in front of the long log building he assumed his friend had slipped	inside and would be able to put up a good fight so he began working	his way down the ditch to join him.	5.173394753860455
1549. at a very shallow place two mexicans	rushed into the open for a shot.	4.806999441995261
1550. dropping to one knee cook	felled one and the other struggled off with his comrade sending no further	fire in his direction.	5.666545527216546
1551. just before leaving the arroyo where he	was partially concealed he did hear shots down at the house.	4.401391225522126
1552. russell had reached the house as cook surmised dismounted but just	as the old trapper opened the door to receive him he fell into the trapper's	arms- dead.	4.84149375963217
1553. a bullet fired by one of the mexicans hiding	in a little chicken house had passed through his head tearing a hole	two-inches square on the outgoing side.	3.725023294674689
1554. finding him dead cook caught	russell's horse and rode to the cattle foreman's house to report	the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins.	4.739803807233411
1555. before daylight sunday morning a posse of twenty-three men under	the leadership of deputy sheriff frank macpherson of catskill followed	the trail to the house of francisco chaves where 100 to 150	mexicans had gathered.	3.6949817479553224
1556. macpherson boldly approached the fortified	adobe house and demanded entrance.	6.144814417540349
1557. the men inside informed him that they	had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see	them even though he offered medical aid.	4.343870971298439
1558. the officer demanded the names	of the injured men; the mexicans not only refused to give them	but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it.	4.402868911127614
1559. since	the strength of the mexicans had been underrated too small a posse	had been collected and since the deputy had not been provided with	search warrants macpherson and his men decided it was much wiser to	withdraw.	3.5935030797680594
1560. the posse's retreat encouraged the mexicans to	be overbearing and impudent.	5.315964723648707
1561. during the following week six tons of hay	belonging to one rancher were burned; some buildings farm tools	two horses plows and hay owned by bonito lavato a friendly interpreter	for the company and pedro chavez' hay were stolen or destroyed;	and a store was broken into and robbed.	3.297478321230224
1562. district attorney m	w mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught	committing these crimes or carrying arms- he just didn't catch	anyone.	5.257324219263641
1563. increasing threats on his life finally convinced cook	that he should leave new mexico.	4.003864637933735
1564. his friends advised that it would	be only a question of time until either the mexicans killed him by	ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense perpetuating	the troubles.	4.974892041000736
1565. by early summer he wrote from laramie that he	was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in a bad	way financially so pels sent him a draft for $100 warning that it	was still not wise for him to return.	3.4813612969190078
1566. pels also sent a check for $100	to russell's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his	grave.	5.0670556827622395
1567. cattle stealing and killing again serious during the	spring of 1891 placed the land grant company officers in a perplexing	position.	3.7416869787591867
1568. they were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property	thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on	the vermejo and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary	for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot.	5.20625479757774
1569. and	the law virtually ignored the situation.	5.289085212213691
1570. the judge became ill just as	the colfax district court convened no substitute was brought in	no criminal cases heard only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried	and court adjourned sine die after sitting a few days instead of the usual	three weeks.	4.509532884884049
1571. pels complained: litigants and witnesses were	put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact	business; public money spent; justice delayed; nothing accomplished	and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to	be an absolute farce.	3.174213241857226
1572. word reached the company that the man	behind these depredations was manuel gonzales a man with many followers	including a number who were kept in line through fear of him.	5.137405728082055
1573. although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old man named asher jones	the warrant for his arrest had never been served.	3.9851895873813596
1574. on may 19 a	deputy sheriff's posse of eight men left maxwell city and rode thirty-five	miles up the vermejo where they were joined by juan jose	martinez.	5.18087146203519

1576. when they were refused entrance to his brother's house nearby	they smashed down the door broke the window and threw lighted clothes	wet with kerosene into the room.	5.104701046214631
1577. still there was no gonzales and	the family would say nothing.	5.8110430238699395
1578. about 300 yards up the creek was	a cluster of mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a	square.	5.856563100279898
1579. while prowling around these buildings two of the posse recognized	the voice of gonzales speaking to the people inside.	4.524085833842964
1580. he was promised	that no harm would befall him if he would come out but he cursed	and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door.	5.460528996283563
1581. the	posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building	would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him	dead or alive.	3.539645351617376
1582. in deadly earnest the besiegers methodically	stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags	inside only to have most stamped out by the women as soon as they hit	the floor.	4.996144454799241
1583. when it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer	taking a thousand to one chance gonzales rushed outside square against	the muzzle of a winchester.	3.9415704592075578
1584. shot near the heart he turned to	one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away three	bullets following him.	4.758972536424235
1585. as he pushed open the door he fell on his	face one of his comrades pulling him inside.	4.832633887485982
1586. not realizing the	seriousness of the wound the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender	the house would be burned down around him.	6.070354431284695
1587. receiving no answer	they set the fire.	5.219666477665999
1588. when the house was about half consumed his comrade	ran to the door and threw up his hands declaring repeatedly that	he did not know the whereabouts of manuel.	5.296533547801023
1589. finding it true that he	was not inside the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes	through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed	covered by a blanket.	3.7145890461936673
1590. several slugs fired into the bed jerked aside	the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand.	5.651062519581482
1591. shot six or eight	times the body was draped with russell's pistol belt and cartridges.	4.018132735096413
1592. there was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who though	numbering in the fifties had stood around on the hillside nearby	without firing a shot during the entire attack.	5.46993300656914
1593. early the next	morning a mexican telephoned pels that celso chavez one of the	posse members was surrounded by ten mexicans at his father's home	on the upper vermejo.	3.541875223425387
1594. the sheriff and district attorney mills	hastily swore	out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed	according to signed statements by chavez and dr i p george	and ordered deputy barney clark of raton to rescue the posseman.	4.75098314532253
1595. traveling all night clark and twelve men arrived at about seven	o'clock may 22.	3.994880720245243

1597. a mexican justice of the peace had issue a writ against	chavez for taking part in the murder of manuel gonzales	so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger.	4.320148235019697
1598. the men	helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to raton along	with three other families desiring to leave.	4.653079438027171
1599. the ten or more	dangerous parties singled out for prosecution were still at large and	pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe	houses defending themselves through loopholes it would be most difficult	to capture them.	3.35057833249374
1600. thus he wired j p lower and sons of	denver: have you any percussion hand grenades for throwing in a	house or across a well loaded with balls or shrapnel shot?	4.783632361878977
1601.  if not	how long to order and what is the price?	5.644607109403433
1602.  he wisely decided that	it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup	particularly since the mexicans were on their guard.	5.117156480208038
1603. his problem	then became one of restraining the american fighters who wanted to clean	out the vermejo by force immediately.	3.9411435959340464
1604. the plant was located west of the battenkill and south of the location	of the former electric light plant.	5.301028313053215
1605. the manchester depot	sewer company issued 214 shares of stock at $10 each for construction	of a sewer in that locality and assessments were made for its maintenance.	3.186273188504057

1617. there the matter stands with	the prospect that soon manchester may be removed from the roster of	towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams.	4.133218760683587
1618. telegraph	manchester's unusual interest in telegraphy has	often been attributed to the fact that the rev j d wickham	headmaster of burr and burton seminary was a personal friend and	correspondent of the inventor samuel f b morse.	5.195213393221973
1619. at any	rate manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system	which was set up in 1844 between baltimore and washington.	3.9350543716420994
1620. in	1846 matthew b goodwin jeweler and watchmaker became the town's	first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business	two doors north of the equinox house or one door north	of the bank manchester vermont.	4.642353543744491

1628. the line soon lived up	to its name as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a	dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends	on its capital stock.	4.430408393081206
1629. in 1879 the same clark wait with h	h holley of south dorset formed the american telegraph	line extending from manchester depot via factory point and	south dorset to dorset.	3.400170553882384
1630. besides being most convenient the line soon	proved a good investment for the owners.	5.888289822724765
1631. telegraphers at the	depot at this time were aaron c burr and mark manley of burr	and manley dealers in lumber and dry goods.	3.758043196555686
1632. early equipment	was very flimsy; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles	making communications impossible.	6.006178025585041
1633. but companies continued to spring	up.	6.236627984188189
1634. by 1883 the battenkill telegraph company was in existence	and alvin pettibone was its president.	5.7292865156256685

1641. the village office of western union	with george towsley as manager and telegrapher continued in hard's	drugstore until 1905.	3.4284152241159416
1642. during the summers towsley often needed	the assistance of a company operator.	6.846296955740123
1643. these were the years when	people flocked to manchester not only to play golf which had come	into vogue but also to witness the ekwanok country club tournaments.	3.9301037734810365
1644. new yorkers were kept informed of scores by reporters who telegraphed	fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers.	5.3552569008840605
1645. this boosted local telegraph business and manchester basked in	all the free advertising.	4.157601580199868

1651. she was succeeded by clarence goyette.	6.5051435993765745
1652. since	that time the telegraph office has shifted in location from the railroad	station at the depot and shops at the center back to the town clerk's	office and drugstore at the village.	5.244258713307813
1653. after being located for	some years in the village at the equinox pharmacy under the supervision	of mrs harry mercier it is presently located in the hill	and dale shop manchester center.	3.892273174572969
1654. the first known telephone	line in manchester was established in july 1883 between burr and	manley's store at manchester depot and the kent and root marble	company in south dorset.	4.678812018689847

1660. a small single switchboard was installed	in the village over woodcock's hardware store	.	5.885589797688273
1661. george woodcock was manager and troubleshooter;	elizabeth way was the first operator; and a night operator was also	employed.	4.286424635722977
1662. anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phones	advertised the fact along with the telephone number in the manchester	journal.	6.370404976252499
1663. in 1918 the new england telephone company	began erecting a building to house its operations on the corner of u	s rte 7 and what is now memorial avenue at manchester center.	3.6845191423054646
1664. service running through barnumville and to bennington county	towns east of the mountains was in the hands of the gleason telephone	company in 1925 but major supervision of telephone lines	in manchester was with the new england telephone and telegraph company	which eventually gained all control.	5.278913929571701
1665. more aerial and underground	equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care	of the expanding business.	4.630900488313977

1669. in 1932 dorset received its own exchange	which made business easier for the manchester office but it was	not until february 1953 that area service was extended to include manchester	and dorset.	3.4104219701798746
1670. this eliminated toll calls between the two towns.	7.79944952230858
1671. within a month calls were up seventy per cent.	5.351792895728755
1672. power	electricity plays such an important part in community life	today that it is difficult to envision a time when current was not	available for daily use.	5.790937219710697
1673. yet one has to go back only some sixty years.	5.179655678913753
1674. the first mention of an electric plant in manchester seems	to be one installed in reuben colvin's and houghton's gristmill	on the west branch in factory point.	4.756436068911639
1675. no records are available as	to the date or extent of installation but it may have been in 1896.	4.812305944844753
1676. on june 14 1900 the manchester journal reported that	an electrical engineer was installing an electric light plant for edward	s isham at ormsby hill.	5.106676792312618
1677. this was working by the end	of august and giving satisfactory service.	4.795202602987652
1678. in november 1900	surveying was done under john marsden on the east mountains to ascertain	if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate	an electric power plant.	5.382662834212263
1679. nothing came of it perhaps due to lack of	opportunity for water storage.	4.447651350613073
1680. the next step was construction	by the manchester light and power company of a plant on the west	bank of the battenkill south of union street bridge.	4.718146908024343
1681. this was nearly	completed may 23 1901 with a promise of lights by june 10 but	the first light did not go on until september 28.	3.7090784084340354
1682. it was at the end	of the sidewalk in front of the dellwood cemetery cottage.	7.871274216224007
1683. the	first directors of the manchester light and power company were	john marsden m l manley william f orvis george smith	and john blackmer.	3.6838463708111506
1684. the officers were john marsden president;	john c blackmer vice-president; george smith treasurer;	and william f orvis secretary.	4.875659013570204
1685. marsden was manager of the	company for ten years and manager of its successor company the colonial	light and power company for one year.	3.726322918183409
1686. at about the time	the marsden enterprise was getting under way the vail light and	lumber company started construction of a chair stock factory on the	site of the present bennington co-operative creamery intending to	use its surplus power for generating electricity.	4.76274456194701
1687. manchester then had	two competing power companies until 1904 when the manchester light	and power company purchased the transmission system of the vail	company.	3.5033994744337345
1688. this was fortunate as the vail plant burned in 1905.	6.859434136514463
1689. the colonial light and power company was succeeded by the vermont	hydro-electric corporation which in turn was absorbed by the	central vermont public service corporation.	3.4465867515764335
1690. the latter now furnishes	the area with electricity distributed from a modern sub-station at	manchester depot which was put into operation february 19 1930 and	was improved in january 1942 by the installation of larger transformers.	4.51127356754289
1691. for a time following the abandonment of the local plant	electric current for manchester was brought in from the south with	an emergency tie-in with the vermont marble company system to the north.	4.0545373534453555
1692. some who have written on utopia have treated it as a learned	diversion of a learned world a phantasy with which more amused	himself a holiday work a spontaneous overflow of intellectual	high spirits a revel of debate paradox comedy and invention.	4.622279264676277
1693. with	respect to this view two points are worth making.	4.477601198394805
1694. first it appears	to be based on the fact that on its title page utopia is described	as festivus gay.	6.899855827026082
1695. it overlooks the other fact that	it is described as nec minus salutaris quam festivus no	less salutary than gay.	3.9707474376706213
1696. it also overlooks the fact that in a rational	lexicon and quite clearly in more's lexicon the opposite of	serious is not gay but frivolous and the opposite of gay is not serious	but solemn.	5.523068616468053
1697. more believed that a man could be both serious and gay.	4.96280475064025
1698. that a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional	illusion sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly	believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because	they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode	of expression their authors are capable of.	4.833581615313831
1699. secondly to find a learned	diversion and a pleasing joke in more's account of the stupid	brutalities of early sixteenth century wars of the anguish of the poor	and dispossessed of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful	requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising	in a moral imbecile and most surprising in more himself.	3.3154949361540473
1700. indeed	it is even surprising in the canon of christ church and regius	professor of ecclesiastical history who fathered this most peculiar	view and in the brilliant professor of medieval and renaissance	english at cambridge who inherited it and is now its most eminent	proponent.	4.603573110695904
1701. but to return to the main line of our inquiry.	6.269999280952547
1702. it	is doubtful that utopia is still widely read because more was medieval	or even because he was a martyr- indeed it is likely that these	days many who read utopia with interest do not even know that	its author was a martyr.	5.032657949398206
1703. utopia is still widely read because in	a sense more stood on the margin of modernity.	4.117840216577415
1704. and if he did stand	on the margins of modernity it was not in dying a martyr for such unity	as papal supremacy might be able to force on western christendom.	6.097065361053899
1705. it was not even in writing latin epigrams sometimes bawdy ones or	in translating lucian from greek into latin or in defending the study	of greek against the attack of conservative academics or in attacking	the conservative theologians who opposed erasmus's philological	study of the new testament.	3.5197478526877233
1706. similar literary exercises were the	common doings of a christian humanist of the first two decades of the	sixteenth century.	6.26576216135074
1707. had more's writings been wholly limited to such	exercises they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen	or so other authors living in his time whose works tenuously survive	in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit	of their very specialized occasions read those works.	3.4293921130339284
1708. more	stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone- because he	wrote utopia.	5.448482501884564
1709. and the evidence that he does indeed stand there	derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual	readers have responded to that book for the past century or so.	3.8723626117507237
1710. only one other contemporary of more's evokes so immediate and direct	a response and only one other contemporary work- niccolo machiavelli	and the prince.	5.382612303142122
1711. can we discover what it is in utopia	that has evoked this response?	6.1790722644192
1712.  remember that in seeking the modern	in utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the renaissance	there; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing	on the same inconceivable	scale the relative importance of the medieval the	renaissance and the modern.	4.743099556198017
1713. the medieval was the most important	to chambers because he sought to place thomas more the author of	utopia in some intelligible relation with st thomas more	the martyr.	3.413473899621708
1714. to others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance	of christian humanism the renaissance elements are of primary	concern.	5.82354792234023
1715. but here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation; we want	to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has; we want	to know what is perennially new about utopia.	3.624414666832623
1716. what is new	about it?	11.749049409667752
1717.  to that question the answer is simple; it can be made	in two words utopian communism.	4.956260467940513
1718. but it is an answer which opens the	door wide to an onrush of objections and denials.	6.693160234966844
1719. surely there is nothing	new about communism.	5.289832839054316
1720. we find it in plato's republic and	in utopia more acknowledges his debt to that book.	6.086469046836519
1721. we find it	in that common way of life h pleasing to christ and h still in	use among the truest societies of christians that is the better	monasteries which made it easier to convert the utopians to	christianity.	4.044276039950847
1722. we find it in the later stoic conception of man's natural condition	which included the community of all possessions.	6.559563533577696
1723. this conception	was taken up by the early church fathers and by canon lawyers and	theologians in the middle ages; and more was far too well read not	to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it.	3.7510566306324935
1724. but although the idea of communism is very old even in more's	day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 it	is not communism as such that we are concerned with.	5.187274122325691
1725. we are concerned	not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus:	platonic stoic early christian monastic canonist or theological	communism; we are concerned with utopian communism- that is simply	communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of utopia	as more conceived it.	3.3044946782775364
1726. perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity	of utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier	types of communistic theory.	5.848107535680576
1727. we will achieve a more vivid sense	of what it is by realizing what it is not.	5.416348154158808
1728. in plato's republic	communism is- to speak anachronistically- a communism of janissaries.	6.001229871442224
1729. its function is to separate from the base ruled mass among	whom private ownership prevails the governing warrior elite.	3.952070047710788
1730. moreover	it is too readily forgotten that in the republic what	gave	the initial impetus to plato's excursus into the construction of an	imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods wives	and children was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of	the individual human psyche; and it is to this problem that the republic	ultimately returns.	4.924125900184388
1731. in more's utopia communism is not	a means of separating out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass.	3.8043872679306676
1732. utopian	communism applies to all utopians.	8.197425186029347
1733. and in the economy of the	book it is not peripheral but central.	6.635424545672613
1734. the concern of utopia is	with the optimo reipublicae statu the best ordering of a civil society;	and it is again and again made clear that utopian communism	provides the institutional array indispensible to that best ordering.	4.546232058195505
1735. to derive utopian communism from the jerusalem christian community	of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors-in-spirit	the monastic communities is with an appropriate shift of adjectives	misleading in the same way as to derive it from plato's republic:	in the republic we have to do with an elite of physical	and intellectual athletes in the apostolic and monastic communities with	an elite of spiritual and religious athletes.	3.4323395954151508
1736. the apostolic community	was literally an elite: chosen by christ himself.	5.315964723648707
1737. and the monastic	communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only	after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic	rigors their spiritual athleticism.	4.310415910060512
1738. finally the conception	of the natural community of all possessions which originated	with the stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by more's time although	it was not accepted by all the theologian-philosophers of the	middle ages.	4.611176831533819
1739. in that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in	the age of innocence before the fall of man.	4.320293625240173
1740. it did not serve to	contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order	because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man	had sinned.	5.624200144799142
1741. the actual function of patristic-civilian-canonist-scholastic	communism was adequately set forth by st gregory almost a	millenium before more wrote utopia.	3.4545560222394105
1742. the soil is common	to all men h.	5.9846264875949124
1743. when we give the necessities of life to the poor	we restore to them what is already theirs.	4.764438378707458
1744. we should think of it more	as an act of justice than compassion.	7.714283439624251
1745. because community not	severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely	unalterable right to what is his.	4.520980688180994
1746. indeed of all that is his every	man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated	to regard himself as a custodian.	6.186928900083692
1747. he is a trustee for the common good	however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of	property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund	wisely or unwisely entrusted to his keeping.	3.80024616603665
1748. in contrast to this	stoic-patristic view utopia implies that the nature of man is such	that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of	municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness	in a sieve.	5.16214537228069
1749. the utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions.	4.280553672808819
1750. in	a properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the	function which in natural law theory ineptly is left altogether to	a small voice so often still.	4.664612998467164
1751. in all the respects just	indicated	utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community	of possessions and living plays a role.	4.147914844415574
1752. neither from one of these	conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced.	6.83653642370333
1753. we do	not deny originality to the agamemnon because aeschylus found the	tales of the house of atreus among the folk lore of the greeks.	4.0959943070421
1754. in	a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may	find in it utopian communism remains as an integral whole original-	a new thing.	4.889739072366804
1755. it is not merely a new thing; it is one of the very	few new things in utopia; most of the rest is medieval or humanist	or part of an old tradition of social criticism.	4.3506668617172055
1756. but to say that	at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say	that it is modern; and for this statement the best evidence comes	within the five years following the publication of utopia when	martin luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the divine's	encounter with man.	4.808684603012521
1757. new indeed is luther's perception but	not modern as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible	to modern students what luther was getting at.	3.6824102484891346
1758. although utopian	communism is both new in 1516 and also modern it is not modern communism	or even modern socialism as they exist or have ever existed in	theory or in practice.	5.150502187709015
1759. consider the features of utopian communism:	generous public provision for the infirm; democratic and secret elections	of all officers including priests meals taken publicly in common	refectories; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens;	even houses changed once a decade; six hours of manual labor	a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars and careful measures	to prevent anyone from shirking; no private property no money;	no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services and therefore	no market in the economic sense of the term.	3.1259461814493603
1760. whatever the merits of	its intent utopian communism is far too naive far too crude to suit	any modern socialist or communist.	5.275932774771675
1761. it is not the details of utopian	communism that make utopia modern it is the spirit the attitude	of mind that informs those details.	4.8473705845355175
1762. what that spirit and attitude	were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts	with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history the	one which reached christianity by the way of stoicism through the	church fathers of late antiquity.	4.810947121328029
1763. during the dorr trial the democratic press condemned the proceedings	and heralded dorr as a martyr to the principles of the declaration	of independence.	4.001525722013477
1764. during the brown trial however the state's	most powerful democratic newspaper the providence daily post	stated that brown was a murderer a man of blood and that he and	his associates with the assistance of republicans and abolitionists	had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow	of state and federal governments.	5.140930969540682
1765. the providence daily journal	answered the daily post by stating that the raid of john	brown was characteristic of democratic acts of violence and that he	was acting in direct opposition to the republican party who proclaim	as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere	with slavery in the states.	3.446041105225758
1766. the two major newspapers in providence	continued throughout the crisis to accuse each other of misrepresenting	the facts and attempting to falsify history.	4.895987298231051
1767. while the	daily post continued to accuse republicans and the daily journal	continued to accuse democrats the woonsocket patriot complained	that the virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly	haste to condemn brown and his men.	3.3785903760348064
1768. editor foss stated of their	guilt h there can be no doubt h but they are entitled to sufficient	time to prepare for trial and h a fair trial.	5.41158315077985
1769. the providence	daily post thought that there were probably good reasons for	the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing	gained by a delay would be calmer feelings.	3.850414679179729
1770. the providence daily	journal stated that although the guilt of brown was evident the	south must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace.	4.715725658310473
1771. on october 31 1859 john brown was found guilty of treason	against the state of virginia inciting slave rebellion and murder.	4.2861075564994495
1772. for these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in public on friday	december 2 1859.	6.089169198273437
1773. upon receiving the news northern writers editors	and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the southern states	particularly virginia.	3.91713772261723
1774. although rhode islanders were preparing	for the state elections they watched john brown's trial with	extreme interest.	5.737411495334116
1775. on wednesday morning november 2 1859 the providence	daily journal stated that although brown justly deserved	the extreme penalty no man however criminal ought to suffer the penalty	without a fairer trial.	3.472963095684131
1776. the editor's main criticism of the trial	was the haste with which it was conducted.	5.61236123547299
1777. the readers of the providence	daily post however learned that it was generally conceded	that old brown had a fair trial.	3.7513726580990165
1778. concerning the sentence	the editor asked what else can virginia do than to hang the men	who have	defied her laws organized treason and butchered her citizens.	4.67288338831304
1779. in the eastern section of the state the newspapers' reaction	to brown's trial and sentence were basically identical.	4.77669515941706
1780. j	wheaton smith editor of the warren telegraph stated that the	ends of justice must be satisfied a solitary example must be set	in order that all those misnamed philantropists sic who actuated	by a blind zeal dare to instigate riot treason and murder may	heed it and shape their future course accordingly.	4.3624998336216985
1781. the editor of	the newport advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating	circumstances in the brown trial which would warrant making an exception	to the infliction of capital punishment.	3.285969766250561
1782. in direct contrast	to the other rhode island editors samuel s foss of the woonsocket	patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely	unfair.	4.977567281094271
1783. concerning the sentence foss wrote if it be possible	h that mercy shall override vengeance h and that john brown's	sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment it would be well- well	for the country h and for virginia.	3.387225094996286
1784. despite the excitement	being caused by the trial and sentence of john brown rhode islanders	turned their attention to the state elections.	6.54801286090714
1785. the state had	elected republican candidates in the past two years.	5.328788358547397
1786. there was no doubt	as to the control the republican party exercised throughout the	state.	7.064982707341651
1787. if it failed on occasion to elect its candidates for general state	offices by majorities the failure was due to a lingering remnant	of the know-nothing party which called itself the american republican	party.	3.5846922129516074
1788. the american republicans and the republicans both nominated	lieutenant-governor turner for governor.	5.886533201248608
1789. elisha r potter	was the democratic candidate.	5.219666477665999
1790. the results of the election of 1859	found republican candidates not only winning the offices of governor	and lieutenant-governor but also obtaining the two congressional offices	from the eastern and western sections of the state.	4.705114525192617
1791. during	the month of november hardly a day passed when there was not some mention	of john brown in the rhode island newspapers.	3.739124052661031
1792. on november	7 1859 the providence daily journal reprinted a letter sent	to john brown from e b a quaker lady in newport.	5.175397591164153
1793. in	reference to brown's raid she wrote though we are non-resistants	and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal	weapons h we know thee was anemated sic by the most generous	and philanthropic motives.	3.268131341214724
1794. e b compared john brown	to moses in that they were both acting to deliver millions from	oppression.	5.729308597446827
1795. in contrast to e b most rhode islanders	hardly thought of john brown as being another moses.	4.108642553937785
1796. most attempts	to develop any sympathy for brown and his actions found an unresponsive	audience in rhode island.	5.69933189648018
1797. on wednesday evening november	23 1859 in warren rev mark trafton of new bedford gave	a mission of sympathy lecture in which he favorably viewed the	harper's ferry insurrection.	3.7256401597965136
1798. the warren telegraph stated	that many of rev trafton's remarks were inappropriate and savored	strongly of radicalism and fanaticism.	4.705010556909502
1799. in its account of the trafton	lecture the providence daily post said that the remarks	of	rev trafton made the people indignant.	4.388860132326044
1800. no sympathy or admiration	for brown could be found in the providence daily post	for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison	who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy.	6.086149463229172
1801. the providence	daily journal however stated that brown's courage bravery	and heroism in a good cause would make a man a martyr; it gives	something of dignity even to a bad one.	3.3337813678557846
1802. the woonsocket patriot	admitted that john brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment	but he should no more be hung than henry a wise or james	buchanan.	4.456516269869767
1803. the newport mercury exhibited more concern over	the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of brown than it	did over the development of sympathy for him.	3.533702991163081
1804. in her letter	to john brown e b the quakeress from newport had	suggested that the american people owed more honor to john brown for	seeking to free the slaves than they did to george washington.	5.027030739838112
1805. during	the latter days of november to the day of brown's execution	it seems that most rhode islanders did not concur in e b's	suggestion.	3.809559836953468
1806. on november 22 1859 the providence daily journal	stated that although brown's pluck and honest fanaticism	must be admired any honor paid to brown would only induce other fanatics	to imitate his actions.	4.835366817542542
1807. a week later the daily journal	had	discovered the initial plans of some providence citizens to hold a	meeting honoring john brown on the day of his execution.	3.5249105267198795
1808. the editor	of the daily journal warned h that if such a demonstration	be made it will not find support or countenance from any of the men	whose names are recognized as having a right to speak for providence.	4.8578474217411864
1809. the providence daily post's editor wrote that he could	not	believe that a meeting honoring brown was to be held in providence.	4.105217814901806
1810. he further called upon the people of providence to rebuke the meeting	and avoid disgrace.	6.347974983683626
1811. on december 2 1859 john brown was	hanged at charles town virginia.	4.90532077966387
1812. extraordinary precautions were	taken so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen within	the enclosure surrounding the scaffold.	5.728679419982057
1813. in many northern towns and	cities meetings were held and church bells were tolled.	4.461773146587562
1814. such was not	the case in rhode island.	7.849917960683684
1815. the only public demonstration in honor	of john brown was held at pratt's hall in providence on the	day of his execution.	3.725520860869334
1816. despite the opposition of the city newspapers	the pratt hall meeting brought together a very respectable	audience composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years	for their radical views upon the subject of slavery of many of our	colored citizens and of those who were attracted to the place by the	novelty of such a gathering.	5.442494088610628
1817. seated on the platform were amos c	barstow ex-mayor of providence and a wealthy republican stove	manufacturer; thomas davis an uncompromising garrisonian; the	reverend augustus woodbury a unitarian minister; the reverend	george t day a free-will baptist; daniel w vaughan	and william h h clements.	3.164684617466118
1818. the latter two were appointed secretaries.	7.413461662752312
1819. the first speaker was amos c barstow who had been unanimously	chosen president of the meeting.	4.957978625501366
1820. he spoke of his desire to promote	the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared john	brown of harper's ferry to the john brown of rhode island's	colonial period.	4.944001282526678
1821. barstow concluded that as rhode island's john	brown became a canonized hero if not a saint so would it be with	john brown of harper's ferry.	3.4659768178505845
1822. the next speaker was george	t day.	7.180162431549053
1823. although admitting brown's guilt on legal grounds	day said that brown is no common criminal; his deed was not	below but above the law.	3.711136447759656
1824. following day was woodbury who spoke of his	disapproval of brown's attempt at servile insurrection his admiration	of brown's character and his opposition to slavery.	5.062660549805197
1825. woodbury's	remarks were applauded by a portion of the audience several times	and once there was hissing.	4.750084698499031
1826. the fourth and last speaker was thomas	davis.	6.69513321990128
1827. by this time large numbers of the audience had left the	hall.	6.437375467288985
1828. davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling	of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the	citizens and all the newspapers of the city.	5.099864440410382
1829. he said that the propriety	or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled	by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments.	4.752169863531596
1830. in the remainder of his speech davis spoke of his admiration for	brown and warned those who took part in the meeting that they are	liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding	men whom the laws have condemned.	5.145891720414662
1831. he recalled that in rhode island	a party opposed to the state's condemnation of a man	proclaimed the state's action as a violation of the law	of the land and the principles of human liberty.	3.9124248497963454
1832. at the close of davis'	speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president	and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously:	whereas john brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring	to deliver those who are denied all rights h and is this day doomed	to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper:	therefore   resolved that while we most decidedly disapprove	the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects yet h in his	willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom we still	recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit	which true men have always admired and which history never fails	to honor.	4.503656814419029
1833. resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in kansas	occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on	the propagation of slavery in that territory call for a charitable	judgment upon his recent efforts in virginia to undermine the despotism	from which he had suffered and commend his family to the special	sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice.	3.1886130745589707
1834. resolved h that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for	resolute action.	5.9596864846392394
1835. resolved that we find in this fearful tragedy	at harper's ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the	evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible h.	3.5870203906817744
1836. on the morning following the pratt hall meeting the editor of the	providence daily journal wrote that although the meeting was	milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes	it could have been avoided completely.	5.24452742374665
1837. rather than being deceived the eye is puzzled; instead of seeing objects	in space it sees nothing more than- a picture.	3.9151716903006877
1838. through	1911 and 1912 as the cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to	the literal surface became harder and harder to deny the task of keeping	the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving	contrivances.	4.623863211233904
1839. to reinforce and sometimes to replace the simulated	typography braque and picasso began to mix sand and other foreign	substances with their paint; the granular texture thus created likewise	called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective	over much larger areas.	3.5953506068519756
1840. in certain other pictures however braque began	to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing.	5.438411841003271
1841. these areas by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern stated the	literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting	contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could	be rescued- and set to shuttling again- only by conventional perspective;	that is by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted	within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography	except near the surface.	3.1371310892696003
1842. the accumulation of such devices	however soon had the effect of telescoping even while separating	surface and depth.	5.387869840261396
1843. the process of flattening seemed inexorable and it	became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to	prevent it from fusing with the illusion.	3.6349132966433917
1844. it was for this reason and	no other that i can see that in september 1912 braque took the radical	and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain	wallpaper to a drawing on paper instead of trying to simulate	its texture in paint.	5.11462100664854
1845. picasso says that he himself had already made	his first collage toward the end of 1911 when he glued a piece of	imitation-caning	oilcloth to a painting on canvas.	4.051071287374806
1846. it is true that his first	collage looks more analytical than braque's which would confirm	the date he assigns it.	5.681585976709684
1847. but it is also true that braque was the	consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography;	and moreover he had already begun to broaden and simplify the	facet-planes of analytical cubism as far back as the end of 1910.	4.444898070458333
1848. when we examine what each master says was his first collage we	see that much the same thing happens in each.	6.323877502824014
1849. that braque's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal	by its greater	corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness the affixed paper	or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more	vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures	had ever done.	3.1661271850525434
1850. but here again the surface-declaring device both	overshoots and falls short of its aim.	5.757408538537557
1851. for the illusion of depth created	by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else	gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief which gives	way in turn and with equal immediacy to an illusion that seems	to contain both- or neither.	3.3496923523126383
1852. because of the size of the areas	it covers the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily	as more than an indication or sign.	6.500794826006312
1853. literal flatness now tends to	assert itself as the main event of the picture and the device boomerangs:	the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before.	3.368686057931947
1854. instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing	it the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it and	the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with	which to finish as well as start his picture.	5.050177586999809
1855. the actual surface	becomes both ground and background and it turns out- suddenly and paradoxically-	that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion	is in front of upon the surface.	3.590857999155955
1856. in their very first collages	braque and picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed	paper or cloth so that certain of the principal features of their	subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into real bas-relief space-	or to be about to do so- while the rest of the subject remains	imbedded in or flat upon the surface.	4.772397514823254
1857. and the surface is driven back	in its very surfaceness only by this contrast.	4.503367591461173
1858. in the upper	center of braque's first collage fruit dish	a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally	vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture	plane.	4.739833019046428
1859. the trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no longer enclosed	between parallel flatnesses but seems to thrust through the surface	of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it.	3.5135176843237876
1860. yet the	violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper and the	only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering	manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture	plane so that it does not jump.	5.183447573004275
1861. at the same time the wallpaper	strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and	patches of shading charcoaled upon them and by their placing in relation	to the block capitals; and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed	back by their placing and by contrast with the corporeality	of the woodgraining.	3.472776901653841
1862. thus every part and plane of the picture keeps	changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane; and	it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts	of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with	the surface.	4.677976288330227
1863. and the same thing more or less can be said of the contents	of picasso's first collage.	5.974097411508362
1864. in later collages of both	masters a variety of extraneous materials are used sometimes in the	same work and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving	and eye-undeceiving device they can think of.	4.9135034094303505
1865. the area adjacent	to one edge of a piece of affixed material- or simply of a painted-in	form- will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface while	something will be drawn painted or even pasted over another part of	the same shape to drive it back into depth.	3.4080210756939864
1866. planes defined as parallel	to the surface also cut through it into real space and a depth is	suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially.	4.63479892887524
1867. all this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to	encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it.	4.6196840390583915
1868. flatness may now monopolize everything but it is a flatness become	so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself- at least	an optical if not properly speaking a pictorial illusion.	5.129706837652187
1869. depicted	cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal	undepicted kind but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms	the undepicted kind- and it does so moreover without depriving	the latter of its literalness; rather it underpins and reinforces	that literalness re-creates it.	3.3924763038650347
1870. out of this re-created literalness	the cubist subject reemerged.	8.227889623553734
1871. for it had turned out by a	further paradox of cubism that the means to an illusion of depth and	plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation	or imaging.	3.675044907791035
1872. in the analytical phase of their cubism braque	and picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply	in order to preserve it; they had also had to generalize it-	to the point finally where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted	from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely	as the illusion of depth and relief as such: as a disembodied	attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself.	4.2997024367259815
1873. in order to be saved plasticity had had to be isolated; and	as the aspect of the subject	was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable	and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity	was isolated under the cubist method the subject itself became largely	unrecognizable.	3.7361804582202214
1874. cubism in its 1911-1912 phase	was on the verge of abstract art.	5.739974350684024
1875. it was then that picasso and braque were confronted with	a unique dilemma: they had to choose between illusion and representation.	4.078383411955185
1876. if they opted for illusion it could only be illusion per se-	an illusion of depth and of relief so general and abstracted as	to exclude the representation of individual objects.	4.974407354420258
1877. if on the other	hand they opted for representation it had to be representation per	se- representation as image pure and simple without connotations	of the three-dimensional space	in which the objects represented originally existed.	3.5941001005437383
1878. it was the	collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear: the representational	could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface	now that illusion and representation had become for the first time	mutually exclusive alternatives.	5.0648460848396235
1879. in the end picasso and braque	plumped for the representational and it would seem they did so	deliberately.	4.693858254679376
1880. but the inner formal logic of cubism	as it worked itself out through the collage had just as much to do	with shaping their decision.	5.44306126369345
1881. when the smaller facet-planes of analytical	cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large dense shapes	formed by the affixed materials of the collage they had to coalesce-	become synthesized- into larger planar shapes themselves	simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane.	3.5488348514533383
1882. left	in their previous atom-like smallness they would have cut away too abruptly	into depth; and the broad opaque shapes of pasted paper would	have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane.	4.959127653694821
1883. large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves	as independent shapes and to the extent that they are flat	they also assert themselves as silhouettes; and independent silhouettes	are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject	from which a picture starts.	3.5263279059579884
1884. it was	because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason- that	is because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage	as a shape- that the identity of depicted objects or at least	parts of them re-emerged in braque's and picasso's papiers colles	and continued to remain more conspicuous there- but only as	flattened silhouettes- than in any of their paintings done wholly in	oil before the end of 1913.	4.79084662975645
1885. analytical cubism came to an end	in the collage but not conclusively; nor did synthetic cubism fully	begin there.	3.685338251241182
1886. only when the collage had been exhaustively translated	into oil and transformed by this translation did cubism become	an affair of positive color and flat interlocking silhouettes whose legibility	and placement created allusions to if not the illusion of	unmistakable three-dimensional identities.	4.6241305458691295
1887. synthetic cubism began	with picasso alone late in 1913 or early in 1914; this was the	point at which he finally took the lead in cubist innovation away from	braque never again to relinquish it.	3.4839327923756556
1888. but even before that picasso	had glimpsed and entered for a moment a certain revolutionary path	in which no one had preceded him.	5.7101038219070634
1889. it was as though in that instant	he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly	tried to escape all the way back- or forward- to literal three-dimensionality.	3.6855857013134083
1890. this he did by using utterly literal means to carry	the forward push of the collage literally	into the literal space in front of the picture plane.	5.41164694655386
1891. some	time in 1912 picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the	shape of a guitar; to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper	and four taut strings thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real	and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture	plane.	3.1892282216939227
1892. the affixed elements of collage were extruded as it were	and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief.	4.943383761200579
1893. and without	high density in the core rapid-transit systems cannot be maintained	economically let alone built from scratch at today's prices.	3.7146277578638487
1894. however the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever.	7.157911864563925
1895. the new interchange among the four los angeles freeways including	the grade-constructed accesses occupies by itself no less than eighty	acres of downtown land one-eighth of a square mile an area	about the size of rockefeller center in new york.	3.5329777346121394
1896. it is hard to believe	that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law	calls the highest and best use of centrally located urban land.	5.233558875422109
1897. as it affects the city's fiscal situation such an interchange is	ruinous; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should	be taxed to pay for the city services.	4.065243550357077
1898. subways improved land values	without taking away land; freeways boost valuation less	and reduce	the acreage that can be taxed.	5.521074398377426
1899. downtown los angeles is already	two-thirds freeway interchange street parking lot and garage- one	of those preposterous if statistics has already come to pass.	3.5860799631562674
1900. the freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and	mitigates the access problem but it also acts inevitably as an artificial	isolating boundary.	4.759168586399779
1901. city planners do not always use this boundary	as effectively as they might.	4.2607360661217895
1902. less ambitious freeway plans may be	more successful- especially when the roadways and interchanges are	raised allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking	areas below the ramp.	4.755027791214721
1903. meanwhile the automobile and its friend	the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance.	4.00647248218918
1904. in ever greater numbers factories are locating in the suburbs or	in industrial parks removed from the city's political jurisdiction.	5.469027653524917
1905. the appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry	which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants	enough land area to do the entire job on one floor.	3.3977681905172386
1906. to light industry	the economies of being on one floor are much slighter but efficiency	engineers usually believe in them and manufacturers looking for	ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers.	4.593070865911011
1907. this movement of industry away from the central cities	is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe.	4.0014627441031925
1908. it	is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern	of virtually all american cities.	5.9692003974817505
1909. the big factories which are	relatively near the centers of our cities- the rubber factories in	akron chrysler's detroit plants ussteel's pittsburgh	works- often began on these sites at a time when that was the	edge of the city yet close to transport and	power.	3.573378081032905
1910. the leapfrog was a phenomenon of the railroad and	the steam turbine and the time when the belts of residence surrounding	the old factory area were not yet blighted.	4.709415924534301
1911. the truck and	the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his	plant site.	3.470558666016351
1912. until internal combustion became cheap he had to be near	a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community	of lower-class homes.	5.743815627371927
1913. the railroad siding is still important- it	is usually though not always true that long-haul shipment by rail is	cheaper than trucking.	3.406917362585231
1914. but anybody who promises a substantial volume	of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these	days and many businesses can live without the railroad.	4.710981554864613
1915. and there	are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking	lot which can be reached by driving across or against the usual	pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus lines is actually	more convenient than the walk-to factory.	3.4044018570668717
1916. willow run general	electric's enormous installations at louisville and syracuse the	pentagon boeing in seattle douglas and lockheed in los angeles	the new automobile assembly plants everywhere- none of these is	substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit.	4.505662051798856
1917. they are all suburban plants relying on the roads to keep them supplied	with workers.	4.893182341900413
1918. and wherever the new thruways go up their banks are	lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry.	5.029322102730556
1919. the	drive along massachusetts' route 128 the by-pass which makes an	arc about twenty miles from downtown boston may be a vision of the future.	3.784593827309181
1920. the future could be worse.	6.51334578478144
1921. the plants along route 128	are mostly well designed and nicely set against the new england rocks	and trees.	3.7355529649614265
1922. they can even be rather grand like edward land's monument	to the astonishing success of polaroid.	5.98662265402013
1923. but they deny the values	of the city- the crowded competitive tolerant city the melting	pot which gave off so many of the most admirable american qualities.	4.531534171044271
1924. they are segregated businesses combining again on one site	the factory and the office drawing their work force from segregated	communities.	5.329703242133651
1925. it is interesting to note how many of the plants on massachusetts'	route 128 draw most of their income either from the government	in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements or from the exploitation	of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly.	4.0416178700675
1926. while	the factories were always the center of the labor market they were	often on the city's periphery.	5.976357498083123
1927. in spreading the factories even farther	the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth	pattern of the cities.	3.9129593927071773
1928. even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt's	motel has been relatively painless; the hotel-motel demarcation	is becoming harder to find every year.	5.560681731921372
1929. what hurts most is the damage	the automobile has done to central-city retailing especially in	those cities where public transit is feeble.	3.777327978562136
1930. some retailing	of course always spreads with the population- grocery stores drugstores	local haberdasheries and dress shops candy stores and the like.	5.081054198781015
1931. but whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago- a	new bedroom set or a winter coat an easter bonnet a bicycle for junior-	the family set off for the downtown department store where the	selection would be greatest.	3.2765938771954044
1932. department stores congregated in the	one hundred per cent location where all the transit lines converged.	5.2288514545018705
1933. these stores are still there but the volume of the downtown	store has been on a relative decline while in many cities the suburban	branch sells more and more dry goods.	3.90107910730136
1934. if the retailer and	hotelman's downtown unit sales have been decreasing however his dollar	volume continues to rise and it is dollars which you put in the	bank.	5.36945044188006
1935. in most discussions of this phenomenon the figures are	substantially inflated.	4.916365850517278
1936. no suburban shopping-center branch- not even	hudson's vast northland outside detroit- does anything like	the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise	to be found in the home store.	5.35915621992862
1937. telephone orders distort the	picture: the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than a central-city	number if both are listed in an advertisement especially if	the local call eliminates city sales tax.	3.4434753867070733
1938. the suburban branch is thereby	credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass	doors had never opened.	5.503151963503262
1939. accounting procedures which continue to charge	a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store	make the branches seem more profitable than they are.	3.449119589876722
1940. in many cases	that statement we break even on our downtown operation and make money	on our branches would be turned around if the cost analysis were	recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store.	4.824296423423962
1941. fear of the	competition- always a great motivating force in the american economy-	makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate	both the volume and the profitability of their rival's shiny new	branches.	3.972606877712099
1942. the fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are	uneconomical that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important	as it was downtown and that even highly suburbanized cities will	support only so many big branches.	5.01507527391383
1943. moreover the cost of operations	is always high in any new store as the conservative bankers who	act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover.	3.9683289622876563
1944. when all has been said however the big branch store remains a major	break with history in the development of american retailing.	6.041815786547183
1945. just	as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant	to the worker with a car the trip to the shopping center may seem far	easier than to the downtown department store though both are the same	distance from home.	3.448039439079236
1946. indeed there are some cities where the suburban	shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown.	6.0425592431645905
1947. raymond vernon reports that residents of east st louis	have been driving across the mississippi through the heart of downtown	st louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping simply	because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart	of town.	3.9084257857482037
1948. to the extent that the problem is merely parking an aggressive	downtown management like that of lazarus brothers in columbus	ohio can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot	next door.	5.303086920537601
1949. if the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened	away from downtown by traffic problems however the city store	can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways	or await the completion of the federal highway program.	3.583669688946435
1950. and if the	affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with nice	people rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports	the downtown department store the central location may be in serious	trouble.	5.126625372721051
1951. today according to land economist homer hoyt shopping	centers and their associated parking lots cover some 46000 acres	of land which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's	central business districts put together.	3.5487968870360356
1952. the downtown	store continues to offer the great inducement of variety both within	its gates and across the street where other department stores are immediately	convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available	before making up her mind.	4.77621945814988
1953. if anything may be predicted in the quicksilver	world of retailing it seems likely that the suburban branch will	come to dominate children's clothing	household gadgetry and the discount business	in big-ticket items.	3.435809184987742
1954. department stores were built on dry goods especially	ladies' fashions and in this area in the long run the suburban	branches will be hard put to compete against downtown.	5.548825002224248
1955. if this	analysis is correct the suburban branches will turn out to be what management's	cost accountants refuse to acknowledge marginal operations	rather than major factors.	4.049393903213211
1956. historically in america the appeal	of cities has been their color and life the variety of experience	they offered.	5.488464210541893
1957. how ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm?	5.878967161659676
1958.  was	a question that had to be asked long before they saw paree.	6.349101407589748
1959. though	americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious	belief they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality	of downtown.	3.499879517314526
1960. only a radical change in the nature of the population in	the central city would be likely to destroy this preference- and we	must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change	gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians is actually upon us.	5.655828303030677
1961. in their book american skyline	christopher tunnard and henry hope reed argue that franklin roosevelt's	new deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility-	a fine ironical argument when you consider how suburbanites tend to	vote.	3.440332232682248
1962. the first superhighways- new york's henry hudson and chicago's	lake shore san francisco's bay bridge and its approaches	a good slice of the pennsylvania turnpike- were built as	part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression.	4.813117635789447
1963. at the same time roosevelt's federal housing administration	coupled with henry morgenthau's cheap-money policy permitted	ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes.	4.119233236656023
1964. bankers	who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house	itself got that security from the u s government; householders	who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term high-interest	mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per	cent under government aegis.	5.011519205524884
1965. before losing itself in the sands of the 19th century the grand stream	of italian renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance	in the brumidi frescos of the capitol rotunda in washington.	3.747933726778345
1966. the artistic generation after brumidi was trained in the paris	of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution and tended	to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were	easy to find.	4.4213396952104125
1967. but it is a great conception.	10.189340917358702
1968. the open ceiling with	allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky:	the closed frieze formally divided into historical scenes and tightly	tied to the stone walls belong in their large ordering to the line	of correggio and his baroque followers.	4.152331802958107
1969. the descent may be remote	but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance	in the united states.	3.3564185518874785
1970. constantino brumidi designed the	decorative scheme as a whole in collaboration with the architect charles	u walter at the time when plans were being made to replace	the wooden dome of bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure.	5.04440878222915
1971. after many years and many interruptions he was able to finish	the canopy fresco and slightly less than half the frieze beginning	with the liberty group opposite the east door and ending with william	penn all but one leg when a tragic accident ended his career.	3.45530482309249
1972. he left at his death sketches drawn to scale for the rest of the circle.	6.16879503516448
1973. these were carried out not too faithfully by filippo costaggini	who began by supplying the missing member to the founder of pennsylvania	and noting in pencil in italian that he began at this point.	3.3991710357195917
1974. when costaggini had used up all the sketches thirty-six	feet of empty frieze were left over.	5.945995372001781
1975. a blank undecorated void plastered	in roughcast disfigured the wall of the rotunda until 1951.	3.981840683965065
1976. then	advised by the architect of the capitol the joint committee	for the library traditionally responsible for the works of art in the	building ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco to show	the peace after the civil war the spanish-american war	and the birth of aviation to match as nearly as feasible	brumidi's technique and composition.	4.862005855962294
1977. later the cleaning and restoration	were ordered first of the older part of the frieze finally of	the canopy.	5.298864965377247
1978. what follows is therefore a description of three separate	undertakings the new frescoing of the gap and the successive essays	in conservation with some discussion of problems that arose in connection	with each.	4.875654853667039
1979. for the use of students and future restorers	a full day-by-day record was kept of all three undertakings complete	technical reports on what we found and what we did.	4.066724116611843
1980. these may be consulted	in the office of the architect of the capitol or the library	of congress.	6.319462361876148
1981. the first preliminary was inspecting the unfinished	length of frieze a jumble of roughcast and finish coats all	in	bad condition.	3.758905484521229
1982. it was decided to strip the whole area down to the bricks	and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree	with the older artists' preparation with a mortar one part slaked	lime three parts sand to be put on in two layers.	4.772050221330066
1983. cartoons were drawn	full size after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities.	4.092411569102882
1984. there was some difficulty here.	10.220011015036953
1985. one had to manage the given subjects	three diverse recent events so as to make them part of a classical	frieze- that is a pattern of large figures filling the space	with not much else against a blank background.	3.8521805677261454
1986. moreover all three	representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the	length brumidi allowed for each one of his.	6.082928316089969
1987. when it was all	arranged to fit and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement	in the frieze the cartoons were tried in place.	4.201506660504697
1988. the scaffolding a	confusion of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above was strong and	safe but obscured visibility.	4.705010556909502
1989. nothing could be seen from the floor	but by moving around the gallery one could get glimpses; and we were	able to decide on some amplification of scale.	3.593234252299905
1990. to be sure of matching	color as well as form pieces of cartoon were traced on the roughcast	and large samples painted in fresco then left two months to dry	out to their final key.	5.409253825178524
1991. later it was gratifying to note that they had	set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came.	4.3868040756402245
1992. the	scaffold was the length of the space to be painted.	7.604024103479929
1993. what bits of brumidi	and costaggini could be reached at either end seemed in good	order though the roughish sandy surface was thick with dust.	3.666071727063683
1994. washed	they came out surprisingly clear and bright.	6.743273855772659
1995. it could be seen that	both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster one half inch	and that both followed the traditional italian fresco technique as described	by cennino cennini in the 14th century and current in italy	to this day.	3.412704973540326
1996. that is they used opaque color throughout getting solid	highlights with active lime white.	6.298484908345059
1997. painting a secco is much	in evidence.	5.219666477665999
1998. a brown hatching reinforces and broadens shadows and	much of the background is solidly covered with a dark coat.	5.078284996494666
1999. this brown	is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint.	4.295493139325422
2000. in our own practice to have the last intonaco plaster coat thick	enough to match and at the same time to avoid fine cracks in	drying	we found that it had to be put on in two layers letting the first	set awhile before applying the second.	5.526112803093115
2001. the mortar was three parts sand	to two of lime.	3.9843222565600884
2002. some of the lime that is always on hand in the capitol	basement for plaster repairs was slaked several months for us;	but to make it stiffer of a really putty-like consistency to avoid cracking	we added a little hydrated lime- hard on the hands but we	could see no other disadvantage.	4.873312534092596
2003. i am told that a mortar longer slaked	might have remained longer in condition for painting.	4.401252136203605
2004. as it was it	took the pigment well for six hours enough for our purpose and held	it firmly in setting.	5.976969958533369
2005. it was obvious that to match brumidi white must	be mixed with all but the darkest tones.	4.346189004282185
2006. lime white hard and brilliant	has a tendency to jump away from the other colors in drying	and also by its capacity to set to preclude the use of ready-made	gradations so useful in decorative work.	5.305890775801409
2007. in older italian practice	lime dried and reground bianco sangiovanni entered into such	prepared shades.	4.129223173049631
2008. for convenience we chose a stronger pigment	unknown	to the early italians or to brumidi titanium oxide reserving the	active lime white for highest lights put on at the end of the day's	stint.	5.105884778428044
2009. other pigments were mostly raw umber some burnt umber and	a little yellow ochre.	4.284776815102127
2010. this last was probably not in brumidi's palette	but was needed to take the chill bluish look off the new work next	to the old where softening effects	of time were seen even after thorough	cleaning.	4.8506322710243035
2011. the use of secco we tried to restrict to covering	joints.	4.895908513661044
2012. experience showed however that it is very difficult to	paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty	and uneven.	5.965829353065839
2013. later brumidi and costaggini will be seen coping with this	same problem.	4.850488527910637
2014. we were forced as they were to work a good deal of	tempera into background and dark areas.	7.348169010853981
2015. we made it by doerner's	recipe five parts thoroughly washed cheese curd to one of lime putty;	ground together they made a strong adhesive which became waterproof	in drying.	3.7276666691222125
2016. figure 1 was taken in 1953.	7.163184125958424
2017. the new part is finished.	6.0635976940625325
2018. on the right is the brumidi liberty group as it looked after	cleaning operations which had not yet come around to the other end;	where of costaggini only some foliage has been washed at the point	where his work stopped.	4.958568525460401
2019. one is led to speculate as to why the empty	space was there left for our century to finish.	4.40183660723939
2020. costaggini said it	was brumidi's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle.	5.855267973934804
2021. brumidi's son later maintained that costaggini had compressed	and mutilated his father's designs ambitiously coveting a bit he	could claim for his very own.	3.467766426174774
2022. this question might be settled by comparing	the measurement of the actual circumference with the dimensions	noted presumably in brumidi's hand above the various sections of	his long preparatory drawing which has been kept.	4.779127346683367
2023. whose ever	fault	it is evident that brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with	his histories and come full circle with the scene of the discovery	of california gold.	3.5011219909922757
2024. in painting a fresco the handling of wet mortar	compels one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right	not to spoil yesterday's work with today's plastering.	4.650979805575045
2025. at the	very first then brumidi was required by the classically pyramidal	shape of his central group to fill in the triangular space above the	seated girl on liberty's right before starting on the allegorical	figures themselves.	3.4797151201950247
2026. here he put a small man whose missing hands	might have left his function doubtful until comparison with the first	sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning this	was to be the closing figure of the party of forty-niners and	was to hold a basket.	5.841895673289365
2027. one sees costaggini's rendering of the same	figure more than thirty feet away.	4.6531097606811125
2028. the photograph figure 1 of the completed	frieze shows how having been separated from his fellows in	useless isolation for eighty years he has now been given a hand and	by juxtaposition given a new job	to represent the witnesses of the first flight at kitty hawk in	1903.	4.424595561830103
2029. the startlingly bright effect of the first washings led	the committee to order the rest of the brumidi-costaggini cycle cleaned	and restored to go with them.	4.234396013290443
2030. the fixed wooden scaffold was removed	and so as to reach all the frieze one of pipe on wheels built	up from the floor.	4.7223655909193125
2031. every few days in the early morning as the work	progressed twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the	plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the rotunda	pavement supported as it is by ancient brick vaulting.	3.817463490136137
2032. on this	giddy and oscillating platform over fifty feet from the floor after	a first dusting we began to wash.	5.946904322413961
2033. a most useful tool for wetting the	surface without running down was made from a greenhouse mist spray	nozzle welded to a hose connection to be used at low water pressure.	3.6138712733124216
2034. a valve in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower.	5.535226767350575
2035. one	man sprayed with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting.	4.3319909034751385
2036. a second	assistant mopped with two sponges.	7.064901200998796
2037. in parts a repeated sponging was	needed but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to restore	the original brightness.	3.8760258761651207
2038. no soap or other cleaning agent was used that	might bring in unwanted chemical reactions.	5.755469585402549
2039. the painting a fresco	stood up superbly; a little of the secco came off.	3.6311665274219016
2040. necessary	retouching was put on at once.	7.163184125958424
2041. altogether we found the craftsmanship	first rate especially brumidi's.	4.6724501027054846
2042. we were greatly helped by	there being no traces of former restoring.	6.703232231793325
2043. apparently not more than	dusting had ever been done and not much of that.	4.504309734766431
2044. the plaster was sound	the intonaco firmly attached all over and the pigment solidly incorporated	with it in all but a few unimportant places.	4.58402790427742
2045. the greatest	source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly flowed from openings	above soaking the surface and leaving streaks of dissolved lime	very conspicuous even after cleaning particularly in the landing	of columbus oglethorpe and the indians and yorktown.	3.080545876941812
2046. here the architect referring to the use of the capitol as a	public building not a museum requested some repainting to maintain decorative	effect rather than leaving blank unsightly patches.	5.854140043296859
2047. these frescos have had no care for eighty years.	5.3442686800918615
2048. with naked gas jets	below and leaky windows above enough to ruin wall paintings in any	medium they have survived in a building long unheated in winter hot	and damp under the iron dome in summer.	4.6555878658311265
2049. those whom i wish to address with this letter are for the most	part unknown to me.	4.328119925000125
2050. it may well be that when rudy pozzatti and i	visited your country last spring you were living and working close	to the places we saw and the streets we walked.	5.07776535142827
2051. as american artists	it was natural that we would want to meet as many soviet artists as	possible.	4.115932425784339
2052. this letter might not have been necessary had our efforts	to meet and talk with you been more successful.	5.549309958846289
2053. even though we did not	see many of your faces it appears now quite evident that a considerable	number of your profession heard from those whom we had the fortune	to encounter that we had been in your midst.	3.782875704609476
2054. i am very pleased that	quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to	hear of our reactions and experiences in the ussr.	5.425937297077195
2055. i	can well understand your curiosity.	5.619635421798327
2056. we ourselves are always eager	to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live.	6.445859081329422
2057. it is	my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the	good offices of the union of soviet artists.	4.329709798348906
2058. there should	be no reason to misinterpret or ignore the intent of this letter.	7.149268655165408
2059. pozzatti	and i endeavored earnestly to record our impressions without the	prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily provokes.	3.7289827761611933
2060. the time-span	of little more than a month cannot entitle me to pose as an expert	on anything i saw.	5.532182887677444
2061. too much damage is done by experts who	have spent even less time if any at all in the ussr.	4.463978497554644
2062. nevertheless i consider it reasonable because of my commitment	as an artist to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative	individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific	geo-political interests.	5.36469239636826
2063. if this attitude is seriously questioned	in the soviet union it does not necessarily follow that the majority	of the society in which i live is too aware of the necessity for	clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view.	4.265298573429023
2064. it is	a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own countrymen	are too shortsighted to ascribe any symbolic significance to the	plight of a minority such as artists in any social order.	4.827829948416424
2065. i encountered	many questions and great interest upon my return from the soviet union	about my reactions to that experience.	3.9037207939758165
2066. that which i found most	profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction.	5.840422843857378
2067. almost as if i were talking about something quite unreal.	5.0168218596127305
2068. apparently	this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen	objectively or at least dispassionately to individual impressions	of a subject which preoccupies a good deal of their waking moments.	5.9661526208923865
2069. personal	predispositions tend to blunt the ear and in turn the voice	as well.	4.425120857946609
2070. i cannot be content with the anecdotal small talk of a somewhat	unusual travelogue.	6.043471981930542
2071. i am equally impatient with the shrug of the	shoulder shake of the head of those who no longer care because they	have known it for so long; the aggressive disbelief of those who are	romantically lost in a semantic jungle of the word revolution;	the belligerent denunciations by the sick fanatics of ignorance who	try to build a papier-mache wall of pseudo-patriotism on our physical	horizons.	3.530281558754805
2072. difficult as it may have been at times pozzatti and i saw	enough talked to enough artists historians and others to realize	that the issue is quite clear.	5.0543017721003745
2073. artists and poets are the raw nerve-ends	of humanity; they are small in number and their contribution is not	immediately decisive in everyday life.	3.4952481155558908
2074. by themselves they may not	be able to save the life on this planet but without them there would	be very little left worth saving.	5.195447695020047
2075. it cannot be said that our	very first day in the soviet union turned out to be an ordinary one.	5.862089551558409
2076. on that cold but bright april day we were guests of your government	in the reviewing stand of red square to witness the poeple's celebration	for yuri gagarin and later on that day we attended the somewhat	more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive palaces	of the kremlin.	4.724351936495831
2077. if we thus spent our very first day in the midst of	a large number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national	achievement our last day to us at least was equally impressive and	very moving even though the crowds were absent and there was almost	complete silence.	3.6369027661808038
2078. we stood under a gigantic tree in the rolling country	just outside of moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of	a russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to	the point of foregoing the highest international honor.	4.453328673094717
2079. the grave about	half-way between his home and the blue turrets of a small church	rose above the forms and spaces of gently undisciplined pastures of green	the sounds of birds the silence of other graves and the casual	paths through small forests.	3.1650519723325607
2080. just yesterday we had met and talked with	a living writer a contemporary of the dead poet who is known for his	ability of manipulating his ideas and his craft more advantageously.	4.733341542791438
2081. but today we were aware of only two men.	5.212358322872044
2082. one had taken a flight into	uncharted space in the service of science to return as a living hero.	6.0098140473320365
2083. the other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted	space of the human spirit.	5.069447699737885
2084. the flowers on his grave attested to the	fact that he as well was somebody's hero.	5.086197101541402
2085. these two recollections	form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which	to me at least symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as ethical	conflict between materialism and humanism.	4.095092517888319
2086. a struggle that is	being waged all over the world in the half-light of disinterest.	6.685515515102379
2087. the	prevalent opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in	your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was	elaborated even further with an incredible semantic dexterity.	3.6866494365050753
2088. the socialist	environment it was stated had cross-fertilized these two extreme	seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit.	5.089643415040531
2089. when i speculated	on one such occasion that the new growth like other mutations	might be unable to propagate i was immediately accused of preaching	racial prejudice.	3.994196113882185
2090. i could not bring myself to answer that some	of my best friends are non-propagating mules.	6.092141556499651
2091. this kind of	reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to.	4.393070781675352
2092. after a while	we were perhaps less surprised but still puzzled when a friendly	discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most irrelevant and	illogical comparisons.	5.19498789136335
2093. a chance remark about lenin's sealed train	brought the rejoinder that this was a myth akin to george washington's	cherry tree.	4.015241409745184
2094. theories of the behavior pattern of population masses	were compared to scientific discoveries concerning the motion-pattern	of gaseous masses.	5.300988838238279
2095. no wonder that pozzatti and i had at times difficulty	in remembering the real purpose of our presence namely cultural	exchange.	3.9506722116125514
2096. typical of such an experience was the occasion	of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the union	of soviet artists.	5.386924467959534
2097. we had looked forward to what we hoped to be our	first informal meeting with a number of moscow's artists.	4.579514043794223
2098. instead	we became involved in a series of friendly but overly formal welcoming	addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind.	5.86612564374745
2099. the terms	of friendship understanding cooperation etc tend to become	somewhat shopworn because of constant and indiscriminate use.	3.470558666016351
2100. i can only	hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between	our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion.	5.14470513601195
2101. the presiding female functionary of massive proportions and forbidding	appearance initially did not contribute to the expressions of	friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentlemen representing	the arts.	3.560899280113514
2102. it was only after we had responded with what i fear were	similar cliches that she went into action by questioning our desire	for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and	warlike actions by the us government in cuba and laos.	4.731487992950314
2103. she	retreated by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might	well terminate right then and there.	3.685338251241182
2104. unfortunately she returned later	just as i had taken advantage of the friendlier atmosphere in the	room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the cultural exchange	program would be the re-emergence of abstract art in russia	with social realism regaining dominance in the us.	5.008423230445699
2105. this	gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the petulant admonition	that we should not presume to lecture her on abstraction.	3.9707357038357656
2106. she	did not go so far as to say as was done on other occasions that	abstraction as well as impressionism were a russian invention that	had been discarded as unwanted by the people of the ussr	pozatti and i could not know then that we would experience	this sort of treatment more often in moscow than elsewhere.	5.02621427003632
2107. we were	to discover in fact that quite a number of people share with us the	impression that in contrast to other soviet regions moscow's atmosphere	is depressingly subdued and official.	4.109344099145792
2108. to have one's intentions	deliberately or unintentionally misunderstood is always a waste	of time.	7.130911178948437
2109. until our moscow experience i had not considered it necessary	to prepare any argument formally or informally.	4.188158002455981
2110. artists simply do	not talk to each other in that fashion; and furthermore i could	not presume the implication that i spoke for american artists as a	group.	5.075453276755137
2111. to save time some clarification seemed necessary.	5.422338772471507
2112. the following	is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists	in leningrad:   we have come to your land with the	express intention of understanding and respecting your ideas and your	ways.	4.815132230400526
2113. our presence here should also be considered further sincere evidence	of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek	any and all possible ways to effect closer peaceful ties among all	people.	3.384901849771465
2114. we are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future	depends upon the informal contacts and exchanges of ideas between	individuals.	6.295853299570689
2115. in spite of the relatively short period of time that we	have experienced among you we have already seen many indications of	your character and spirit.	4.368395141549243
2116. we are acutely aware that yours is a society	which in spite of several wars and many privations has developed	itself into one of the foremost nations of the world.	6.074153854961407
2117. your past history	is resplendent with the fruits of the intellect.	5.021356218602994
2118. your present history	is equally admirable for its industrial and scientific achievements.	6.303435399573754
2119. we have come to you to experience something of your way of life	while	also attempting to acquaint you with that of ours.	4.464201972995719
2120. while we as american	artists	believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual	activity we would be less than honest with you or ourselves	if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as	well as the international community as a whole.	4.691176676699402
2121. in stating this position	we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists	and intellectuals in other lands to share our opinion in every respect.	3.788213878116595
2122. as a matter of fact we prize the diversity among our own people	so much that we will not presume to speak for all other american artists.	5.87770375541
2123. but certainly all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge	and search for similarities between you and us but rather the thoughtful	exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead	us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of misunderstanding.	3.9189712958377783
2124. like yourselves we have pride and love for our country.	6.703604640584531
2125. to many of us this is a land to which we or our parents fled from totalitarian	terror in order to live in dignified freedom.	5.34042192009581
2126. as artists we	feel the same obligation as do other individuals in considering ourselves	responsible citizens of a great nation.	5.821784766479931
2127. the sane society is an ambitious work.	4.280553672808819
2128. its scope is as	broad as the question: what does it mean to live in modern society?	6.467201377941844
2129. 	a work so broad even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed	by a moral vision must necessarily fail.	3.9267869418887815
2130. even a hasty reader	will easily find in it numerous blind spots errors of fact and	argument important exclusions areas of ignorance and prejudice undue	emphases on trivia examples of broad positions supported by flimsy	evidence and the like.	4.663685780653277
2131. such books are easy prey for critics.	5.720075445684095
2132. nor need	the critic be captious.	9.260665106749666
2133. a careful and orderly man who values precision	and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility might easily be	put off by such a book.	3.7661783646255764
2134. it is a simple matter for one so disposed to	take a work like the sane society and shred it into odds and	ends.	5.2485402392723435
2135. the thing can be made to look like the cluttered attic of a large	and vigorous family- a motley jumble of discarded objects some outworn	and some that were never useful some once whole and bright but	now chipped and tarnished some odd pieces whose history no one remembers	here and there a gem everything fascinating because it suggests	some part of the human condition- the whole adding up to nothing more	than a glimpse into the disorderly history of the makers and users.	3.3372978688781414
2136. that could be easily done but there is little reason in it.	8.713701002800855
2137. it would come down to saying that fromm paints with a broad brush	and	that after all is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression	he has from the outset.	3.9569856820859397
2138. i mention these features of the book	because they are inherent in the book's character and therefore must	be mentioned.	5.799604475324417
2139. it would be superfluous to build a critique around them.	6.13763129482642
2140. there are more substantial criticisms to be made of fromm's account	of capitalist civilization.	7.66381785317563
2141. it is worthwhile to recall that	fromm's treatment has both descriptive and normative aspects.	4.255485948317235
2142. since	i have already discussed his moral position that discussion is	incorporated by reference into the following pages which will focus	on the empirical and analytic side of fromm's treatment.	4.566786271575569
2143. i shall	first indicate a couple of weaknesses in fromm's analysis then argue	that granted these weaknesses he still has much left that is valuable	and finally raise the general question of a philosophical versus	a sociological approach to the question of alienation.	3.796283201226106
2144. almost	no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation.	7.771501150305089
2145. despite	its rather long intellectual history alienation is still a promising	hypothesis and not a verified theory.	4.325323143338109
2146. the idea has received much	attention in philosophy in literature and in a few works of general	social criticism such as the sane society.	6.174018427118402
2147. what is missing is	work that would answer presumably by the use of survey methods and guttman-type	attitude scales such questions as these: what are the	components	of the feeling-state described as alienation?	3.855959967531424
2148.  how widespread	is alienation?	12.17521367916476
2149.  what is its incidence among the various classes	and subgroups of the population?	4.794881430434299
2150.  taking alienation as a dependent variable	with what socio-structural factors is it most highly associated?	5.74665199858818
2151. 	considered as an independent variable how does it affect behavior	in various sectors of life?	4.043113623705843
2152.  until such work is done there must	remain the nagging suspicion that alienation may be little more than	an expression of the malaise of the intellectual who rejected by and	in turn rejecting the larger society projects his own fear and despair	onto the broader social screen.	4.651170914089459
2153. i am not suggesting that	fromm ought to do this kind of work.	6.186255476540026
2154. nor do i think that alienation	is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual.	6.950117473687245
2155. i am saying only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence	comes in any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain	important limitations.	3.7180352945284763
2156. until such evidence appears we must	make do with the evidence we have.	6.4371215752010364
2157. here perhaps fromm is vulnerable	for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available	and he sometimes selects and interprets the evidence in rather	special ways.	3.8333466814707826
2158. fromm's analysis of alienation	in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the	bureaucratization of the corporation the separation of ownership from	control and the broad	dispersion of stock ownership.	4.597053755321933
2159. for all these	points he relies exclusively on berle and means's study of 1932 the	modern corporation and private property.	4.029001115012614
2160. the broad conclusions	of that pioneering work remain undisturbed but subsequent research	has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support has suggested	important revisions in the general analytic frame of reference and	has sharpened the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area.	4.509005006628518
2161. fromm seems unaware of these developments.	5.219666477665999
2162. another example	is his very infrequent use of the large amount of data from surveys	designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on	a broad	range of topics: he cites such survey-type findings just three	times.	5.051346019113385
2163. moreover the conclusions he draws from the findings are not	always the only ones possible.	4.328431462212623
2164. for example he cites the following	data from two studies on job satisfaction: in the first study 85 per	cent of professionals and executives 64 per cent of white collar people	and 41 per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with	their jobs; in the second study the percentages were 86 for professionals	74 for managerial persons 42 for commercial employees 56 for	skilled workers and 48 for semi-skilled workers.	4.913330106665655
2165. he concludes that	these	data show a remarkably high percentage of consciously dissatisfied	and unhappy persons among factory and clerical workers.	3.8991336519857445
2166. starting	from other value premises than fromm's some analysts might conclude	that the percentages really tell us very little at all while others	might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low.	4.507841974446781
2167. eric hoffer	for example once said that america was a paradise- the only	one in the history of the world- for workingmen and small children.	3.879639974934121
2168. what matters is that while fromm's reading of the data is not the	only one possible it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer	who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and	satisfied.	4.9797590319235185
2169. fromm also cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction	conducted by the opinion research corporation in 1945 in which	49 per cent of manual workers said a man ought to turn out as much as	he could in a day's work while 41 per cent said he should not do	his best but should turn out only the average amount.	3.2148318688597826
2170. fromm says these	data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are widespread.	5.739974350684024
2171. that	is one way to read the findings but again there are other ways.	5.041686000151925
2172. one	might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary	associations in the factory an interpretation which would run counter	to fromm's theory of alienation.	5.045409379478015
2173. or he might remind fromm that	the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly low: after all the	medieval guild system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per	cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount; and today's	trade unions announce pretty much the same view.	3.507110697311433
2174. in view	of these shortcomings in both the amount and the interpretation of	survey-type findings on public opinion and considering the criticisms	which can be brought against fromm's philosophical anthropology	such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously.	4.668417167014125
2175. are people	happy are they as satisfied unconsciously as they believe themselves	to be?	4.638443514492864
2176.  considering the nature of man and the conditions for	happiness this can hardly be so.	7.095566196403827
2177. the ambiguities suggested	above stem from a more basic difficulty in fromm's style of thought.	3.67423702443506
2178. he seems to use the term alienation in two different ways.	7.327256041914876
2179. sometimes	he uses it as a subjective descriptive term and sometimes as an	objective diagnostic one.	4.348967364531542
2180. that is sometimes it is used to describe	felt human misery and other times it is postulated to explain unfelt	anxiety and discontent.	5.881914393202803
2181. the failure to keep these two usages	distinct presents hazards to the reader.	3.8892917810975223
2182. it also permits fromm to do	some dubious things with empirical findings.	6.759800501997907
2183. when alienation is used	as an objective and diagnostic category for example it becomes clear	that fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far	toward conquering it.	4.094384638143514
2184. starting from this	and accepting his estimate of the iniquities of modern society it	would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would	be that of a work-satisfaction survey which reported widespread stated	worker satisfaction rather than widespread stated worker dissatisfaction.	4.625255640935861
2185. the point is that in a system such as fromm's which	recognizes unconscious motivations and which rests on certain ethical	absolutes empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition	the writer is urging at the moment.	3.8078301076895977
2186. thus in the example cited above	fromm rests his whole case on the premise that the workers are being	deprived unconsciously unknowingly of fulfillment and then supports	this with survey data reporting conscious experienced frustrations.	4.771286014743155
2187. he has his cake and eats it too: if the workers say they are dissatisfied	this shows conscious alienation; if they say they are satisfied	this shows unconscious alienation.	3.6850448484082405
2188. this sort of manipulation is	especially troublesome in fromm's work because although his system	is derived largely from certain philosophic convictions he asserts	that it	is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and	from his own consulting room.	4.583972537079979
2189. while the empirical psychoanalytic	label which fromm claims sheds no light on the validity of his underlying	philosophy it does increase the marketability of his product.	3.868104033694941
2190. the final example of the failure to use available evidence	though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered	comes from fromm's treatment of some other writers who have	dealt with the same themes.	5.050998046986472
2191. in a brief chapter dealing with various	other diagnoses he quotes isolated passages from some writers	whose views seem to corroborate his own and finds it most remarkable	that a critical view of twentieth-century society was already held	by a number of thinkers living in the nineteenth h.	3.4239143472305194
2192. he finds	it equally remarkable that their critical diagnosis and prognosis	should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of	the twentieth century.	5.2105696610249215
2193. there is nothing remarkable about this at	all.	6.889779148585125
2194. it is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes.	7.3023559316528
2195. there is a difference between evidence and illustration and fromm's	citation of the other diagnosticians fits the latter category.	5.006351930738593
2196. glance at the list: burckhardt tolstoy proudhon thoreau	london marx tawney mayo durkheim tannenbaum mumford a	r heron huxley schweitzer and einstein.	4.979818336248183
2197. this is a delightfully	motley collection.	7.52072729358409
2198. one can make them say the same thing only by	not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants	to hear.	5.616405351823194
2199. the method of selection fromm uses achieves exactly that.	4.384461218859846
2200. furthermore	the list is interesting for its omissions.	6.743273855772659
2201. it omits for	example practically the whole line of great nineteenth century english	social critics nearly all the great writers whose basic position	is religious and all those who are with more or less accuracy called	existentialists.	3.8854545157247404
2202. of course the list also excludes all writers who are	fairly optimistic about the modern situation; these almost	by definition are spokesmen for an alienated ideology.	5.237349699677221
2203. it is not hard	to find that concurrence of opinion which fromm finds so remarkable	when you ignore all who hold a different opinion.	3.8458722374716388
2204. turning from	these problems of the use of evidence one meets another type of difficulty	in fromm's analysis which is his loose and ambiguous use	of certain important terms.	5.383325032807881
2205. one such instance has already been presented:	his use of alienation.	5.589718961112753
2206. the only other one i shall mention here	is his use of the term capitalism.	6.672488779543091
2207. for fromm capitalism is	the enemy the root of all evil.	4.64911091129715
2208. it is of course useful to have a sovereign	cause in one's social criticism for it makes diagnosis and	prescription much easier than they might otherwise be.	5.719696154419574
2209. if one characteristic distinguishes boris godunov it is	the consistency with which every person on the stage- including the	chorus- comes alive in the music.	3.9142850949919583
2210. much of this lifelike quality results	from mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech	inflections.	6.039271756031791
2211. in this he followed a path that led back to the very	source of opera; such composers as monteverdi lully and purcell	with the same goal in mind had developed styles of recitative sensitively	attuned to their own languages.	3.736250808560247
2212. through long experimentation	in his songs mussorgsky developed a russian recitative as different	from others as the language itself.	5.395935227042451
2213. giving most of his musical continuity	to the orchestra he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence	but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words.	3.4910457694994084
2214. the moments of sung melody in the usual sense come most often when	the character is actually supposed to be singing as in folk songs and	liturgical chants.	4.685035398801884
2215. otherwise mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies	for prolonged expressions of emotion- boris' first monologue for	example.	4.18637372575774
2216. even then the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that	the word comes first in importance.	6.272021421071749
2217. aside from boris himself	one need but examine the secondary roles to place mussorgsky among	the masters of musical portraiture.	3.861455875301365
2218. even those who appear in only one	or two scenes are full personalities defined with economical precision.	5.612905625215746
2219. consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action:	pimen varlaam missail and the jesuit rangoni.	4.2715015584380955
2220. under no circumstances	could we mistake one for the other; each musical setting has	an individual touch.	5.9538135626274205
2221. pimen is an old man weak in body- his	voice rarely rises to a full forte- but firm and clear of mind.	3.6470486179968455
2222. his calmness offers contrast to grigori's youthful excitement.	6.69256789314542
2223. a	quiet but sturdy theme somewhat folklike in character appears whenever	the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past	life:    this theme comes to represent the outer world the	realm of battles and banquets- seen from a distance quite distinct	from the quieter spiritual life in the monastery.	3.325996813620625
2224. it changes and develops	according to the text; it introduces pimen when he comes before	boris in the last act.	6.1345435373471
2225. once he has been identified however a	new melody is used to accompany his narrative a bleak motif with barren	octaves creating a rather ancient effect:    an imaginative	storyteller pimen takes on the character he describes as if he	were experiencing the old shepherd's blindness and miraculous cure.	3.4980976469230654
2226. here the composer uses a favorite device of his the intensification	of the mood through key relationships.	5.85687776382007
2227. the original d minor seems	to symbolize blindness inescapable in spite of all attempts to move	away from it.	4.083882642848722
2228. as the child addresses the shepherd in a dream light-	in the form of the major mode- begins to appear and at the moment	of the miracle we hear a clear and shining d major.	5.502775085037578
2229. varlaam	and missail always appear together and often sing together in a straightforward	rhythmically	vigorous idiom that distinguishes them from	the more subtle and well-educated pimen.	3.467766426174774
2230. their begging song might	easily be a folk melody:    the same could be said for the	song to which they make their entrance in the final scene.	5.6833879548599615
2231. apparently	their origin is humble their approach to life direct and unsophisticated.	4.341977880093556
2232. whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't disturb	them now.	6.554025165938929
2233. missail is the straight man not very talkative	mild-mannered when he does speak.	4.0683852436856025
2234. varlaam is loud rowdy uninhibited	in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same.	6.199531002686346
2235. a	rough ostinato figure heard first in the introduction to the inn	scene characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into	the action:    the song of kazan in which this figure	becomes a wild-sounding accompaniment fills in the picture of undisciplined	high spirits.	3.4702686809739793
2236. the phrasing is irregular and the abrupt key	changes have a primitive forcefulness.	5.078074081494962
2237. varlaam's music begins to ramble	as he feels the effects of the wine but he pulls himself together	when the need arises.	3.9251242754008837
2238. both monks respond to the guard's challenge	with a few phrases of their begging song; a clever naturalistic touch	is varlaam's labored reading of the warrant.	5.093684408932216
2239. as the knack gradually	comes back to him his rhythm becomes steadier with the rigid monotony	of an unskilled reader.	4.016614514914676
2240. for the only time in the opera words	are not set according to their natural inflection; to do so would	have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene.	5.724864661614202
2241. musically and	dramatically rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as	varlaam.	4.72144045818026
2242. his music shows a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality	that suggest somehow a blood-kinship with dappertutto in offenbach's	hoffman.	5.102735813614007
2243. his speech shows none of the native accent of the	russian characters; in spite of the italian name he sounds french.	4.5056504910009245
2244. his personality appears more striking by contrast with marina who	is- perhaps purposely- rather superficially characterized.	5.372099434160921
2245. rangoni's first entrance is a musical shock a sudden open fifth	in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it.	3.6178928662820513
2246. the effect is as	if he had materialized out of nowhere.	5.848157229830841
2247. he speaks quietly concealing	his authority beneath a smooth humility just as the shifting harmonies	that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them.	3.6079604686483995
2248. he addresses marina with great deference calling her princess	at first; it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme	that he uses her given name placing himself by implication in the	position of a solicitous father.	4.589998181636915
2249. curiously this scene is a close	parallel to one that verdi was writing at the same time the scene	between amonasro and aida.	4.2385964159461675
2250. rangoni and amonasro have the same	purpose- forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her	country's cause- and their tactics are much the same.	4.627404205750556
2251. rangoni begins	by describing the sad state of the church; this brings a reaction	of distress from marina.	4.033504964048745
2252. the music becomes ethereal as he calls	up a vision of her own sainthood: it is she he tells her who can	bring the truth to russia and convert the heretics.	4.67892438874076
2253. as if in a trance	she repeats his words- then realizes with a shock her own audacity.	4.342820480252343
2254. this is no assignment for a frivolous girl she assures him.	7.032689284249624
2255. now rangoni comes to the point and we hear for the first time	a long downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic	motif of his sinister power.	4.230776805266018
2256. it is a phrase as arresting as a magician's	gesture with a piquant turn of harmony giving an effect of strangeness.	5.599975566421866
2257. another theme sinuously chromatic appears as he directs her	to gain power over grigori by any means even at the cost of her honor.	4.099039496110177
2258. coming from a priest the music sounds as odd as the advice:	marina rebels at this suggestion.	5.138210239895059
2259. her pride is as much at	stake as her virtue; she is the unattainable beauty the princess who	turns away suitors by the dozen.	3.9065776507273546
2260. indignantly she denounces rangoni	for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her.	5.448482501884564
2261. at once the	jesuit pulls out all the stops.	6.563414179358424
2262. to music of a menacing darkness	he describes the powers of satan gaining control of the girl poisoning	her soul with pride and destroying her beauty.	5.22437753966334
2263. the combined threat	of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her and she falls terrified	at his feet.	3.6071236913905156
2264. with another sudden change of mood he is again calm and	protective exhorting her to trust and obey him as god's spokesman-	and the chromatic scale descends in ominous contradiction.	4.764891615667008
2265. whatever	the source of rangoni's power marina is his captive now; we	are reminded of this at the end of the next scene when his theme cuts	through the warmth of the love duet again throwing a chill over the	atmosphere.	3.6758878917042788
2266. the most unusual feature of boris however	is the use of the greatest character of all the chorus.	7.480476601526286
2267. this is the	real protagonist of the drama; the conflict is not boris versus grigori	or shuiski or even the ghost of the murdered child but boris	versus the russian people.	3.702207243975589
2268. mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the	extent to which choral scenes propel the action.	5.331440467598945
2269. boris' first entrance	seems almost a footnote to the splendor of the coronation scene	with its dazzling confusion of tonalities.	3.632711015013689
2270. we have a brief glimpse	of the tsar's public personality the official boris but our	real focus is on the excitement of the crowd- a signigicant contrast	with its halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene its bitter	resentment and fury in the final act.	5.286238453526751
2271. one reason for the unique	vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression.	4.469104968099081
2272. it rarely	speaks as a unit.	9.197812658856618
2273. even in its most conventional appearance the guests'	song of praise to marina there are a few female dissenters criticizing	the princess for her coldness.	4.410199019409942
2274. in many passages- for example	the council of boyars- each section of the chorus becomes a character	group with a particular opinion.	5.78829730123228
2275. hot arguments arise between	tenors and basses who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an	idea.	3.920459412028863
2276. the opening scene shows this method at its most individual.	5.571560151443323
2277. mussorgsky paints a telling picture of the common people those	who must suffer the effects of their rulers' struggle for power without	understanding the causes.	4.067810545601794
2278. they are held in control by force but	barely.	7.819608803100602
2279. they will kneel and plead for boris' leadership in a strangely	intense song its phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for breath	but when the police with their cudgels move away they mock and	grumble and fight among themselves.	3.4499500150658853
2280. there is a quick change from the	plaintive song to a conversational tone.	6.908783176471297
2281. hey mityukh asks one	group what are we shouting about?	4.655872396709527
2282.  and mityukh apparently	the intellectual leader of the crowd replies that he has no notion.	7.361136302653182
2283. the jokes and arguments grow louder until the police return; then	the people strike up their song with even more fervor than before ending	it with a wail of despair.	3.1524264895335206
2284. mussorgsky frequently uses liturgical	music with considerable dramatic force.	6.412214371980113
2285. in pimen's cell the	soft prayers of the monks heard from offstage not only help to set	the scene but emphasize the contrast between young grigori's thoughts	and his situation.	3.400170553882384
2286. this is especially striking between pimen's	quiet exit and grigori's vehement outburst against boris.	6.380165166329181
2287. again as boris feels himself nearing death a procession files into	the hall singing a hymn its modal harmonies adding a churchly touch	to the grim atmosphere:  the words are hardly calculated	to put the tsar's mind at ease.	3.3644260194506748
2288. they echo the words with which	he has described his own vision of the dying child who trembles and	begs for mercy- and there is no mercy.	5.483457129491207
2289. the living as well as	the dead now accuse him; this final reminder of his guilt is the fatal	one.	3.594007507966452
2290. one of the outstanding assets of the present production	is the restoration of the st basil's scene usually omitted	from performances and rarely included in a published score.	5.7064426458887505
2291. though brief	it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy.	4.939802137998792
2292. in addition	it is an important link in the plot giving us a revealing glimpse of	the people's attitude toward boris and the false dimitri.	5.113909935233134
2293. the mayhem	in the forest of kromy is a natural sequel.	4.120299372448122
2294. the st basil's	scene opens with little groups of beggars milling around the	square the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny.	4.697063111575499
2295. in the	orchestra we hear first a hushed hesitant pizzicato figure then	the insistent police motif as it appeared in the opening scene.	4.076894265485808
2296. the service is over and a number of people come from the church	with their spokesman mityukh in the lead.	6.1153342769925505
2297. they bring the news that	the pretender has been excommunicated; this is met with scorn by	the hearers who claim that mityukh is lying or drunk.	3.6221705316798505
2298. contrasts the two groups by their orchestral accompaniment solemn	there is still more news mityukh	announces: they have prayed for the soul of the tsarevich.	4.768459364392754
2299. so far these remarks like most criticisms of hardy have tacitly	assumed that his poetry is all of a piece one solid mass of verse	expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development.	3.5817459866342185
2300. for critics	hardy has had no poetic periods- one does not speak of early hardy	or late hardy or of the london or max gate period but simply	of hardy as of a poetic monolith.	5.008427826254244
2301. this seems odd when one recalls	that he wrote poetry longer than any other major english poet: domicilium	is dated between 1857 and 1860; seeing the	moon rise is dated august 1927.	3.616263703897907
2302. one might expect that in a poetic	career of seventy-odd years some changes in style and method would	have occurred some development taken place.	5.698799512532104
2303. this is not however	the case and development is a term which we can apply to hardy	only in a very limited sense.	4.649713263544188
2304. in a time when poetic style and poetic	belief as well seem in a state of continual flux hardy stands out	as a poet of almost perverse consistency.	5.4557753491298815
2305. though he struggled with	philosophy all his life he never got much beyond the pessimism of his	twenties; the sober opinion of his letter to noyes written	when hardy was eighty years old is essentially that of his first philosophical	notebook entry made when he was twenty-five:	the	world does not despise us: it only neglects us	.	3.383501748076606
2306. and though in his later years he revised his poems many	times the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style	which he had established before he was thirty; so that while it usually	is easy to recognize a poem by hardy it is difficult to date one.	4.714047719126353
2307. there is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about	hardy's development: he did develop toward a more consistent and	more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his.	3.9724727015494383
2308. there is only one hardy style but in the earlier poems that style	is only intermittently evident and when it is not the style is the	style of another poet or of the fashion of the time.	6.5593939697716985
2309. in the later poems	however the personal tone predominates.	5.290145522955193
2310. the bad early poems are	bad shakespeare or bad swinburne; the bad late poems are bad	hardy.	4.905784751440315
2311. there are two ways of getting at a poet's development:	through his dated poems and through the revisions which he made in later	editions of his work.	3.9788196168465855
2312. about a quarter of hardy's poems carry	an appended date line usually the year of completion but sometimes inclusive	years or two separate dates when hardy worked	on the poem or an approximate date	.	4.848975083373151
2313. these dates are virtually the only clues we have to	the chronology of the poems since the separate volumes are neither chronological	within themselves nor in relation to each other.	3.567963136858605
2314. with the	exception of satires of circumstance each volume contains dated	poems ranging over several decades	; the internal organization rarely has any chronological order	except in obvious groups like the poems of pilgrimage the	poems of 1912-13 and the war poems.	4.503790153848136
2315. from the dated poems	we can venture certain conclusions about hardy's career in poetry	always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole	must remain tentative.	3.961357526924077
2316. the dated poems suggest that while hardy's	concern with poetry may have been constant his production was not.	5.171433681370635
2317. he had two productive periods one in the late 1860's the other	in the decade from 1910 to 1920	latter period and these alone total about one-tenth of all hardy's	.	3.915073135676049
2318. there was one sterile period: only one poem is dated between	1872 and 1882 and except for the poems written on the trip to italy	in 1887 very few from 1882 to 1890.	5.086882185743346
2319. the dated poems also	give us an idea of the degree to which hardy drew upon past productions	for his various volumes and therefore probably are an indication	of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time.	3.6241907134632356
2320. poems of the past	and the present and time's laughingstocks both published	while hardy was at work on the dynasts draw heavily on poems	written before 1900.	5.006115656239969
2321. satires of circumstance and moments of	vision coming during his most productive decade are relatively self-contained;	the former contains no poem dated before 1909-10- that	is no poem from a period covered by a previous volume- and the	latter has only a few such.	3.3166625065175124
2322. the last three volumes are again more dependent	on the past as hardy's creative powers declined in his old	age.	5.145231164399467
2323. these observations about hardy's productivity tally with	the details of his life as we know them.	4.882221890170338
2324. the first productive period	came when he was considering poetry as a vocation before he had decided	to write fiction for a living	he wrote that he wrote verses 1865-1868; gave up verse for prose	.	4.862350567139229
2325. during the poetically sterile	years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was	in addition burdened with bad health	.	4.338610092920233
2326. two entries in the early life support the assumption that	during this period hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry.	5.872193013709023
2327. mrs hardy records that h at the end of november 1881	he makes a note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible	; and on christmas day 1890 hardy	wrote: while thinking of resuming 'the viewless wings of	poesy' before dawn this morning new horizons seemed to open and worrying	pettinesses to disappear.	3.440357444046821
2328. there	are more poems dated in the 1890's than in the '80's- hardy	had apparently resumed the viewless wings as he decreased the volume	of his fiction- but none in 1891 the year of tess and only one	in 1895 the year of jude.	4.670057408338856
2329. after 1895 the number increases and	in the next thirty years there is only one year for which there is no	dated poem- 1903 when hardy was at work on the dynasts.	3.9771840204072975
2330. the second productive period the decade from 1910 to 1920 can	be related to three events: the completion of the dynasts in 1909	which left hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years;	the death of emma hardy in 1912 which had a profound emotional	effect on hardy for which he found release in poetry; and the first	world war.	4.651854952307059
2331. it may seem strange that a poet should come to full	fruition in his seventies but we have it on hardy's own authority	that h he was a child till he was sixteen a youth till he was	five-and-twenty	and a young man till he was nearly fifty	life	.	3.680577068349993
2332. we may carry this sequence one step further and say	that at seventy he was a poet at the height of his powers wanting only	the impetus of two tragedies one personal the other national to	loose those powers in poetry.	5.04604068305215
2333. hardy's two productive decades	were separated by forty years yet between them he developed only in	that he became more steadily himself- it was a narrowing not an expanding	process.	3.631728850288585
2334. like a wise gardener hardy pruned away the shakespearian	sonnets and songs and the elements of meter and poetic diction	to which his personal style was not suited and let the main stock	of his talent flourish.	4.985012063478716
2335. the range of the later poetry is considerably	narrower but the number of successful poems is far greater.	4.0662594522081035
2336. we	can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look	at two poems of very different qualities: revulsion	and neutral tones.	4.999430533859474
2337. there is not much to be said for revulsion.	7.443451705958253
2338. like about half of the 1860-70 poems it is a sonnet	on a conventional theme- the unhappiness of love.	6.95969818193296
2339. almost anyone could	have written it; it is competent in the sense that it makes a coherent	statement without violating the rules of the sonnet form but it	is entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike hardy.	3.7463576019224516
2340. the language	is the conventional language of the form; there is no phrase or image	that sounds like hardy or that is striking enough to give individuality	to the poem.	4.885894291876943
2341. it is smoother than hardy usually is but with the	smoothness of anonymity.	4.379682135158329
2342. it is obviously a young man's poem written	out of books and not out of experience; it asserts emotion	without evoking it- that is to say it is sentimental.	5.514920836473056
2343. there are many	such competently anonymous performances among the earlier poems.	4.9434849348441015
2344. neutral tones we immediately recognize as a fine poem in	hardy's most characteristic style: the plain but not quite colloquial	language the hard particular colorless images the slightly odd	stanza-form the dramatic handling of the occasion the refusal to	resolve the issue- all these we have seen in hardy's best poems.	4.461157853679976
2345. the poem does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on exotic	sources of diction yet it is obviously not ordinary speech-	only hardy would say a grin of bitterness swept therebylike an	ominous bird a-wing or wrings with wrong or would describe	a winter sun as god-curst.	3.108154975592788
2346. the details of the setting	of neutral tones are not strictly speaking metaphorical but	they combine to create a mood which is appropriate both to a dismal	winter day and to the end of love and in this way love and weather the	emotions and the elements symbolize each other in a way that is common	to many of hardy's best poems	and to	some moving passages in the novels as well	.	5.186080643761455
2347. neutral	tones is an excellent example of hardy's mature style drawn	from his earliest productive period; i cite it as evidence that he	did not develop through new styles as he grew older	but that he simply learned to use better what he already had.	3.230751876511341
2348. in the	poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's sense of the world; if	it is somber it is also precise and the precision lends authority to	the vision.	5.300748551652811
2349. in revulsion on the other hand the pessimism is	a case not proven; the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the speaker's	right to speak as he does.	3.903810605944003
2350. in the 1860-70 decade there are	many poems like revulsion but there is only one neutral tones.	6.839302859557698
2351. hardy was not hardy very often.	5.219666477665999
2352. the poems of 1912-13	offer a good example of hardy's style as it was manifested	in the later productive decade.	5.1352003111491715
2353. these are the poems hardy wrote after	the death of his first wife; they compose a painful elegy to what	might have been to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness	and ended in long years of suffering and hatred.	3.635598783440373
2354. hardy obviously felt	that these poems were peculiarly personal and private; he sometimes	called them an expiation and he would not allow them to be published	in periodicals.	5.0257742772430944
2355. they are the only poems that he rearranged as	a group between their first appearance	and the publication of the collected poems.	4.042643371348711
2356. the elegiac	tone is hardy's natural tone of voice and it is not surprising	that the 1912-13 poems are consistently and unmistakably his.	5.6366060357754275
2357. the	view is always toward the past; but the mood is not quite nostalgic-	hardy would not allow sentiment to soften his sense of the irredeemable	pastness of the past and the eternal deadness of the dead.	3.767359182762626
2358. the	poems are the epigraph tells us the traces of an ancient flame;	the fire of love is dead and hardy stands as the speaker does	in the last poem of the sequence over the burnt circle of charred sticks	and thinks of past happiness and present grief honest and uncomforted.	4.369291591718607
2359. critically invisible modern revolt like x-rays and radioactivity	is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels	where	it is called delinquency.	3.5033994744337345
2360. disaffiliation by the way	is the term used by the critic and poet lawrence lipton who has	written several articles on this subject the first of which in the	nation quoted as epigraph we disaffiliate h- john l	lewis.	4.868212696365609
2361. like the pillars of hercules like two ruined titans	guarding the entrance to one of dante's circles stand two	great dead juvenile delinquents- the heroes of the post-war generation:	the great saxophonist charlie parker and dylan thomas.	3.717925883201832
2362. if	the word deliberate means anything both of them certainly deliberately	destroyed themselves.	5.972803318763336
2363. both of them were overcome by the horror	of the world in which they found themselves because at last they	could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical	art.	4.161081412121284
2364. both of them were my friends.	10.03998695621113
2365. living in san francisco i saw	them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted	by exasperation or fatigue.	4.210172102721327
2366. so as the years passed i saw them	each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration.	6.6887918475350165
2367. the last time i saw bird at jimbo's bob city he was so	gone-	so blind to the world- that he literally sat down on me before he	realized i was there.	3.5720864760226365
2368. what happened man?	12.730926863765466
2369.  i said referring	to the pretentious jazz concert.	5.400630548460668
2370. evil man evil he	said and that's all he said for the rest of the night.	6.216576277625237
2371. about dawn	he got up to blow.	6.190963651179582
2372. the rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent	melody spiraled through it.	5.078074081494962
2373. the last time i saw dylan	his self-destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality.	4.444221506080131
2374. it	had assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter.	6.412214371980113
2375. being with	him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling stones.	4.39331748174946
2376. now dylan thomas and charlie parker have a great deal more in common	than the same disastrous end.	6.065043372103928
2377. as artists they were very similar.	5.978927538897823
2378. they were both very fluent.	9.96193485523282
2379. but this fluent enchanting utterance had	compared with important artists of the past relatively little content.	4.775589451575423
2380. neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture	at his own creativity.	6.531632923914156
2381. the principal theme of thomas's poetry was	the ambivalence of birth and death- the pain of blood-stained creation.	3.624051093585842
2382. music of course is not so explicit an art but anybody who knew	charlie parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own	gift.	5.935250763530125
2383. both of them did communicate one central theme: against the	ruin of the world there is only one defense- the creative act.	5.011624595232166
2384. this	of course is the theme of much art- perhaps most poetry.	6.209403702822616
2385. it is	the theme of horace who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance	to parker or thomas.	4.242655138423538
2386. the difference is that horace accepted his theme	with a kind of silken assurance.	6.591998988517742
2387. to dylan and bird it was an agony	and terror.	5.377623703083131
2388. i do not believe that this is due to anything especially	frightful about their relationship to their own creativity.	7.8447879472412145
2389. i believe	rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity	seemed to be the sole value.	5.698793749847351
2390. horace's column of imperishable	verse shines quietly enough in the lucid air of augustan rome.	5.331440467598945
2391. art	may have been for him the most enduring orderly and noble activity	of man.	4.36292777501267
2392. but the other activities of his life partook of these values.	7.351369838976483
2393. they did not actively negate them.	7.164706281268761
2394. dylan thomas's verse had to	find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning jews.	6.028129556587999
2395. he was	able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air	raids and gas ovens.	5.13892770617197
2396. as the world began to take on the guise of an immense	air raid or gas oven i believe his art became meaningless to him.	5.602267746473988
2397. i think all this could apply to parker just as well although because	of the nature of music it is not demonstrable- at least not	conclusively.	4.48385430533951
2398. thomas and parker have more in common than theme	attitude life pattern.	5.998957038882124
2399. in the practice of their art there is an	obvious technical resemblance.	5.078689815440108
2400. contrary to popular belief they were	not great technical innovators.	6.679721964661086
2401. their effects are only superficially	startling.	6.331737862607415
2402. thomas is a regression from the technical originality and	ingenuity of writers like pierre reverdy or apollinaire.	5.311121300029413
2403. similarly	the innovations of bop and of parker particularly have been vastly	overrated by people unfamiliar with music especially by that ignoramus	the intellectual jitterbug the jazz aficionado.	3.377283645704905
2404. the tonal novelties	consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music	for centuries.	5.499878729635327
2405. and there is less rhythmic difference between progressive	jazz no matter how progressive and dixieland than there is	between two movements of many conventional symphonies.	4.224303699638664
2406. what parker	and his contemporaries- gillespie davis monk roach	etc- did was to absorb the musical ornamentation	of the older jazz into the basic structure of which it then became	an integral part and with which it then developed.	4.780204484726404
2407. this is true	of the melodic line which could be put together from selected passages	of almost anybody- benny carter johnny hodges.	4.147868243400493
2408. it is true of	the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously or at least	is continuously sprung so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow	the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations of the phrase or	strophe.	5.139836141380309
2409. this is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque	to rococo music.	5.421202403415977
2410. it is the difference between bach and mozart.	9.329393262587386
2411. it is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what thomas	did to poetry.	6.903492701593384
2412. the special syntactical effects of a rimbaud or an edith	sitwell- actually ornaments- become the main concern.	4.762738366226197
2413. the metaphysical	conceits which fascinate the reactionary generation still	dominant in backwater american colleges were embroideries.	3.570845587849075
2414. thomas's	ellipses and ambiguities are ends in themselves.	6.743273855772659
2415. the immediate	theme if it exists is incidental and his main theme- the terror of	birth- is simply reiterated.	3.428445430010395
2416. this is one difference between	bird and dylan which should be pointed out.	7.403410384993559
2417. again contrary to popular	belief there is nothing crazy or frantic about parker either musically	or emotionally.	4.558999856590432
2418. his sinuous melody is a sort of nai^ve transcendence	of all experience.	6.80389981533239
2419. emotionally it does not resemble berlioz	or wagner; it resembles mozart.	4.9816878750032565
2420. this is true also of a painter	like jackson pollock.	8.27319286501931
2421. he may have been eccentric in his behavior	but his paintings are as impassive as persian tiles.	4.809134975503075
2422. partly this difference	is due to the nature of verbal communication.	7.983381700752676
2423. the insistent talk-aboutiveness	of the general environment obtrudes into even the most	idyllic poetry.	3.700289227276755
2424. it is much more a personal difference.	8.840616377654575
2425. thomas certainly	wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world.	4.271543857756372
2426. parker and pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world.	6.320100813445344
2427. technique pure and simple rendition is not of major importance	but it is interesting that parker following lester young was	one of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution.	3.7776432863499547
2428. in modern	jazz the saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played with conventional	embouchure.	5.666719514032038
2429. metrically thomas's verse was extremely conventional	as was incidentally the verse of that other tragic enrage hart	crane.	3.781328358202077
2430. i want to make clear what i consider the one technical	development in the first wave of significant post-war arts.	6.362375731165523
2431. ornament	is confabulation in the interstices of structure.	4.913686410369733
2432. a poem by dylan	thomas a saxophone solo by charles parker a painting by jackson	pollock- these are pure confabulations as ends in themselves.	4.73375195894849
2433. confabulation	has come to determine structure.	5.619635421798327
2434. uninhibited lyricism should	be distinguished from its exact opposite- the sterile extraneous	invention of the corn-belt metaphysicals or present blight of poetic	professors.	4.861416487662795
2435. just as hart crane had little influence on anyone	except very reactionary writers- like allen tate for instance	to whom valery was the last word in modern poetry and the felicities	of an apollinaire let alone a paul eluard were nonsense- so dylan	thomas's influence has been slight indeed.	3.2799255866871806
2436. in fact his only	disciple- the only person to imitate his style- was w s graham	who seems to have imitated him without much understanding and	who has since moved on to other methods.	5.044412331368424
2437. thomas's principal influence	lay in the communication of an attitude- that of the now extinct	british romantic school of the new apocalypse- henry treece j	f hendry and others- all of whom were quite conventional	poets.	3.938158273042053
2438. parker certainly had much more of an influence.	7.91403853425583
2439. at one	time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school	band in america to blow like bird.	4.216592371030908
2440. even before his death this influence	had begun to ebb.	8.09201667589676
2441. in fact the whole generation of the founding	fathers of bop- gillespie monk davis blakey and the	rest-	are just now at a considerable discount.	4.103559666789241
2442. the main line of development	today goes back to lester young and by-passes them.	5.841002181891036
2443. the point	is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays	are aberrant idiosyncratic.	5.262980537675642
2444. there is no longer any sense of continuing	development of the sort that can be traced from baudelaire to	eluard or for that matter from hawthorne through henry james to	gertrude stein.	5.980960159356516
2445. the cubist generation before world war 1 and	on a lower level the surrealists of the period between the wars both	assumed an accepted universe of discourse in which to quote andre	breton it was possible to make definite advances exactly as in the	sciences.	3.4192850500882788
2446. i doubt if anyone holds such ideas today.	7.633187733199164
2447. continuity exits	but like the neo-swing music developed from lester young it is	a continuity sustained by popular demand.	3.685338251241182
2448. in the plastic arts	a very similar situation exists.	7.058866214174952
2449. surrealists like hans arp and max	ernst might talk of creation by hazard- of composing pictures by	walking on them with painted soles or by tossing bits of paper up in	the air.	3.2653762695140407
2450. but it is obvious that they were self-deluded.	11.022760091001807
2451. nothing looks	anything like an ernst or an arp but another ernst or arp.	4.317614708512467
2452. nothing	looks less like their work than the happenings of random occasion.	5.739974350684024
2453. many of the post-world war 2 abstract expressionists apostles	of the discipline of spontaneity and hazard look alike and do look	like accidents.	4.105675319585626
2454. the aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random	may exist but it is a very impoverished appeal.	6.0802154349821365
2455. once again what has	happened is an all-consuming confabulation of the incidentals the accidents	of painting.	4.457074832017884
2456. it is curious that at its best the work of this	school of painting- mark rothko jackson pollock clyfford still	robert motherwell willem de-kooning and the rest- resembles	nothing so much as the passage painting of quite unimpressive painters:	the mother-of-pearl shimmer in the background of a henry mcfee	itself a formula derived from renoir; the splashes of light and	black which fake drapery in the fashionable imitators of hals and sargent.	4.510100777827486
2457. often work of this sort is presented as calligraphy- the pure	utterance of the brush stroke seeking only absolute painteresque values.	3.9433707971683143
2458. you have only to compare such painting with the work of say	sesshu to realize that someone is using words and brushes carelessly.	6.335979770305357
2459. at its best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo	decorative surface.	4.699750026330829
2460. its poverty shows up immediately when compared	with tiepolo where the rococo rises to painting of extraordinary profundity	and power.	5.287357895345115
2461. a tiepolo painting however confabulated is a	universe of tensions in vast depths.	4.033407084863062
2462. a pollock is an object of art-	bijouterie- disguised only by its great size.	5.404383207843004
2463. in fact once the size	is big enough to cover a whole wall it turns into nothing more than	extremely expensive wallpaper.	3.985664505564643
2464. now there is nothing wrong with complicated	wallpaper.	10.607191029628995
2465. there is just more to tiepolo.	6.635859572537576
2466. the great ashikaga	brush painters painted wallpapers too- at least portable ones	screens.	5.764057425862458
2467. a process of elimination which leaves the artist with	nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest	in either artist or public for very long.	3.517573447921184
2468. so in the last couple	of years abstract expressionism has tended toward romantic suggestion-	indications of landscape or living figures.	6.367320877995432
2469. anglo-saxon and greek epic each provide on two occasions	a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic	age.	3.6293302210817977
2470. hrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at finnsburg	and improvises the tale of beowulf's exploits in	a complimentary comparison of the geatish visitor with sigemund	; alcinou^s' court bard sings of the discovered adultery	of ares and aphrodite and takes up	a tale of odysseus while the ithacan wanderer listens on	.	4.214965621865877
2471. nothing in all this is autobiographical: unlike	the poets of deor and widsith the poet of beowulf is	not concerned with his own identity; the poet of the odyssey	reputed blind reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel	demodocus.	3.78893445195082
2472. since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing	is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter there	is prima-facie evidence that beowulf and the homeric poems each	derive from an oral tradition.	4.766640660954833
2473. that such a tradition lies behind	the iliad and the odyssey at least is hard to deny.	4.652114854522662
2474. milman	parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant homeric	poems are largely formulaic and was led to postulate that they could	be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of greek epic survived;	he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate	oral composition and assumed the slightly less likely corollary	that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas.	4.29930144644441
2475. proceeding from	parry's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata francis p	magoun jr argues that beowulf likewise was created from	a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive	generations and the thesis is striking and compelling.	3.314406960956084
2476. yet a fresh	inspection will indicate one crucial amendment: beowulf and	the homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent.	6.014928990302228
2477. the bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a	very skilful oral poet but it appears safe to assume that no sustained	narrative in rhyme could be composed without extreme difficulty even	in a language of many terminal inflections.	3.2739960022737784
2478. assonance seems nearly	as severe a curb although in a celebrated passage william of malmesbury	declares that a song of roland was intoned before the battle	commenced at hastings.	4.622632268446216
2479. the anglo-saxon alliterative line and the	homeric hexameter probably imposed less of a restraint; the verse	of beowulf or of the iliad and the odyssey was not easy	to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents	perforce in earning a livelihood.	3.1556273147309257
2480. yet certain aids were valuable	and quite credibly necessary for reciting long stretches of verse without	a pause.	5.623753058039811
2481. the poet in a written tradition who generally never blots	a line may once in a while pause and polish without incurring blame.	3.2711328379838163
2482. but the oral poet cannot pause; he must improvise continuously	with no apparent effort.	6.007673384703963
2483. even though the bondage of his verse is not	so great as the writing poet can manage it is still great enough for	him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid	composition.	3.7294568266130463
2484. the germanic poet had such aids in the kennings which	provided for the difficulties of alliteration; the homeric poet	had epithets which provided for recurring needs in the hexameter.	4.563260486724028
2485. either	poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply	his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines because the kennings	and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous	synonyms for the chief common and proper nouns.	3.214582740864731
2486. other synonyms	could of course serve the same function and for the sake of ease i	shall speak of kennings and epithets in the widest and loosest poss1ble	sense and name for example gar-dene a kenning for the danes.	4.8642088119208635
2487. verbal and adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction	but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and	adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents and to designate the	members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the poetic	language.	3.3969269980500933
2488. limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in anglo-saxon	as in the other germanic dialects we cannot say how frequently	the kennings in beowulf recurred in contemporary epic on the same	soil.	4.903939752620039
2489. but we can say that since a writing poet with leisure before	him would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and	substantial circumlocution the kennings like the epithets must reasonably	be ascribed to an oral tradition.	3.448938765462612
2490. one of the greatest	homerists of our time frederick m combellack argues that when	it is assumed the iliad and the odyssey are oral poems the	postulated single redactor called homer cannot be either credited with	or denied originality in choice of phrasing.	4.65853184903839
2491. any example of grand	or exquisite diction may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous	lays into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his	completely	unknown fellow-craftsmen.	3.957669559073923
2492. the quest of the historical homer	is likely never to have further success; no individual word in the	iliad or the odyssey can be credited to any one man; no strikingly	effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance	be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus	that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before	christ.	4.605206450555311
2493. this observation is of interest not only to students of homeric	poetry but to students of anglo-saxon poetry as well.	3.9011603678732576
2494. to the	extent that a tale is twice told its final author must be suspect although	plagiarism in an oral tradition is less a misdemeanor than the	standard modus dicendi.	4.729676241752395
2495. combellack argues further and here	he makes his main point that once the iliad and the odyssey	are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to	formulaic poetry homeric critics are deprived of an entire domain they	previously found arable.	3.188358338318412
2496. with a few important and a few more unimportant	exceptions no expression can be deemed le mot juste for its	context because each was very probably the only expression that long-established	practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow.	4.945917469850835
2497. words	or phrases that connoisseurs have admired as handsome or ironic or	humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable	time-servers sometimes accurate and sometimes not.	3.3515864650355898
2498. this observation	too may have reference to anglo-saxon poetry.	6.600382403185883
2499. to the extent that	a language is formulaic its individual components must be regarded	as no more distinguished than other cliches.	4.158424170708115
2500. w f bryan	suggests that certain kennings in beowulf were selected sometimes	for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness but	such a view would appear untenable unless it is denied that the language	of beowulf is formulaic.	4.428040294691671
2501. if the master of scops who was most	responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional he	was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd	and sophisticated misuse of speech elements.	3.4244659282132353
2502. once many significant	phrases are found in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for	prosodic necessity they are not to be defended for their semantic properties	in isolated contexts.	5.8827338453512485
2503. it is false to be certain of having discovered	in the language of beowulf such effects as intentional irony.	4.121308220480805
2504. yet if the argument is turned awry there may be found a	great deal in bryan's view after all.	5.850325114284141
2505. a formulaic element need not	be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious	reflection.	4.087980982007486
2506. time-servers though the periphrastic expressions are	they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous.	5.331440467598945
2507. a long evolution	in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic	age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things	and these formulas are therefore potentially rather than always actually	accurate.	3.3832813169678695
2508. true we do not know how they were regarded in their	day but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive	to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who	have read germanic or homeric poetry all their lives and still found	much to admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases.	5.033034880903297
2509. nouns and adjectives in a written tradition are chosen for the nonce;	in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus	and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation.	3.4860179279479935
2510. reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars	in an oral poem; no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable	ruins of heorot or the palace of priam.	4.912808192259401
2511. a ship at dry-dock	could be called a foamy-necked floater in anglo-saxon or a swift	ship in greek.	3.812991877133981
2512. even when defenseless of weapons the danes would be	gar-dene and priam would be |e|u|m|m|e|l|i|h|s.	6.154261912120119
2513. achilles like siegfried in the nibelungenlied	is potentially the swiftest of men and may accordingly	be called swift-footed even when he stands idle.	3.587426875308265
2514. in coriolanus	the agnomen of marcius is used deliberately and pointedly but the	homeric epithets and the anglo-saxon kennings are used casually and	recall to the hearer a familiar story or situation or a useful or	pleasant quality of the referent.	4.607447647353628
2515. the epic language was not entirely	the servant of the poet; it was partly his master.	3.5177069743400518
2516. the poet's	intentions are difficult to discern and except to biographers unimportant;	the language however is a proper object of scrutiny and the	effects of the language are palpable even if sometimes inevitable.	4.5056166070789105
2517. beowulf and the homeric poems appear oral compositions.	4.6724501027054846
2518. yet	they are written; at some stage in their evolution they were transcribed.	5.6380004005191555
2519. albert b lord suggests that the homeric poems were dictated	to a scribe by a minstrel who held in his mind the poems fully matured	but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it	would	be useless to his guild and magoun argues that the beowulf	poet and cynewulf may have dictated their verse in the same fashion.	3.277794593762794
2520. this explanation is attractive but is vitiated at least in part by	the observation that cynewulf though he used kennings in the traditional	manner was a literate man who four times inscribed his name by runes	into his works.	4.645492155498875
2521. if cynewulf was literate the beowulf poet	may have been also and so may the final redactor of the iliad and	the odyssey.	3.7192981579478324
2522. in lieu of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate	bard one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry	recited and became intimately familiar with the established aids	to poetizing and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of	the compositions of the past.	4.710083803632038
2523. other theories of origin are compatible	with the formulaic theory: beowulf may contain a design for	terror and the iliad may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering	to a ceramic pattern produced during the geometric period in	pottery.	3.450316184911042
2524. the account of the growth and final transcription of these	epics rests partly however upon the degree to which they were formulaic.	5.509023301352352
2525. carl eduard schmidt counted 1804 different lines repeated	exactly in the two homeric poems and by increasing this figure so	as to include lines repeated with very slight modifications he counted	2118 different lines used a total of 5612 times.	3.3809043873292945
2526. thus one line in	five from the iliad and the odyssey is to be found somewhere	else in the two poems.	6.674107299884356
2527. the ratio is thoroughly remarkable because the	lines are so long- half again as long as those of beowulf.	3.891940575707934
2528. anglo-saxon	poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition;	there is no reason to think that the scop used and re-used whole lines	and even lengthy passages after the manner of his homeric colleague.	5.07323606529614
2529. in determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle	however to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their entirety	for a stock of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the poet	to extemporize with deftness if they provided for prosodic needs.	3.3743369727703008
2530. the closest scrutiny is owed to the anglo-saxon kennings and the homeric	epithets; if any words or phrases are formulaic they will be.	4.489155318941073
2531. the iliad has two words for the shield |a|s|p|i|s	and |s|a|k|o|s.	3.873635296338494
2532. recent criticism of great expectations has tended to emphasize	its symbolic and mythic content to show as m d zabel has	said of dickens generally that much of the novel's impact resides	in its allegoric insight and moral metaphor.	4.857107774351506
2533. j h miller's	excellent chapter on great expectations has lately illustrated	how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective.	3.6436827247720274
2534. in his analysis however he touches upon but fails to explore an idea	generally neglected in discussions of the book which i believe is	central to its art- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature	of the narrative.	4.968540213083418
2535. this essay seeks to make that exploration.	5.569119605363294
2536. dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great victorian	writers.	6.277662158503808
2537. he knew instinctively that next to voice and face an	actor's hands are his most useful possession- that in fiction as	in the theatre gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing	character and dramatizing action and response.	3.3392966295180173
2538. it is hardly accidental	therefore that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or	eccentric things with their hands.	6.063532480437199
2539. in great expectations the hands	become almost an obsession.	4.939479607666261
2540. mr jaggers habitually bites his	forefinger	a gesture which conveys both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness	that half fascinates half terrifies all who have dealings with him.	4.846603700304824
2541. miss havisham's withered hands heavy as if her unhappiness were	somehow concentrated in them move in restless self-pity between her	broken heart and her walking stick.	3.584233017505336
2542. pumblechook's signature	is the perpetually extended glad hand.	6.743273855772659
2543. wemmick reveals his self-satisfaction	by regularly rubbing his hands together.	4.477601198394805
2544. old mr pocket's	frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless social-climbing	wife is to put his two hands into his disturbed hair and make	an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it whereas	joe gargery endures the shrewish onslaughts of mrs joe by apologetically	drawing the back of his hand across and across his nose.	4.358138962888235
2545. such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark were it	not that in great expectations as in no other of dickens' novels	hands serve as a leitmotif of plot and theme- a kind of unifying	symbol or natural metaphor for the book's complex of human interrelationships	and the values and attitudes that motivate them.	3.439439173024857
2546. dickens	not only reveals character through gesture he makes hands a crucial	element of the plot a means of clarifying the structure of the novel	by helping to define the hero's relations with all the major characters	and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt pursuit	crime greed education materialism enslavement	friendship romantic love forgiveness and redemption.	4.542064706999979
2547. we have only to think of lady macbeth or the policeman-murderer	in thomas burke's famous story the hands of mr ottermole	to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment.	3.8558476834044573
2548. so it is with great expectations whether the hands be	orlick's	as he strikes down mrs gargery or pip's as he steals a	pie from her pantry.	5.188164490353615
2549. such associations suit well with the gothic or	mystery-story aspects of dickens' novel but on a deeper plane they	relate to the themes of sin guilt and pursuit that have recently	been analyzed by other critics.	3.414207047642511
2550. the novel opens with a fugitive	convict frantically trying to avoid the nemesis of being laid hands	on- a mysterious figure who looks into pip's frightened	eyes in the churchyard as if he were eluding the hands of the dead	people stretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist	upon his ankle and pull him in.	4.692250581022424
2551. magwitch terrifies pip into	stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination	of a bogy man who may softly creep h his way to him and tear	him open in him.	3.466480540174415
2552. as pip agonizes	over the theft that his own hands have committed his guilty conscience	projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local signpost transforming	it into a phantom devoting me to the hulks.	4.924834260142421
2553. held	upside down in the graveyard pip clings in terror with both hands	to his convict; later he flees in panic from the family table	just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the	front door by a soldier who accusingly holds out a pair of handcuffs which	he has brought to gargery's forge for mending.	3.2754584981480317
2554. through such details	dickens indicates at the outset that guilt is a part of the ironic	bond between pip and magwitch which is so unpredictably to alter	both their lives.	5.703605346905786
2555. since they commonly translate thoughts and	feelings into deeds hands naturally represent action and since nearly	half the characters in great expectations are of the underworld	or closely allied to it the linking of hands with crime or violence	is not to be wondered at.	3.5413992418161135
2556. dickens for excellent psychological reasons	never fully reveals magwitch's felonious past but pip at the	convict's climactic reappearance in london shrinks from clasping	a hand which he fears might be stained with blood.	4.481223380679198
2557. orlick	slouches about the forge like cain with his hands in his pockets	and when he shouts abuse at mrs joe for objecting	to his holiday she claps her hands in a tantrum beats them upon her	bosom and upon her knees and clenches them in her husband's	hair.	3.1860275258183326
2558. this last rampage is only the prelude to the vicious	blow upon her head dealt by some unknown hand whose identity	is later revealed not verbally but through a manual action- the tracing	of orlick's hammer upon a slate.	4.534415220077208
2559. pip himself is to feel the	terror of orlick's murderous hand in his secret rendezvous	at the sluicehouse on the marshes.	3.5853166747464886
2560. dickens lays great emphasis on	the hands in this scene.	6.144814417540349
2561. orlick shakes his hand at pip bangs the table	with his fist draws his unclenched hand across his mouth as if	his mouth watered for his victim lets his hands hang loose and	heavy at his sides and pip observes him so intensely that he knows	of the slightest action of his fingers.	3.0444225021029774
2562. orlick might almost	be magwitch's bogy man come alive a figure of nemesis from pip's	phantasy of guilt.	5.267194435410776
2563. the scarred disfigured wrists of mr	jaggers' housekeeper are the tell-tale marks of her sinister	past for her master coolly exhibiting them to his dinner guests makes	a point of the force of grip there is in these hands.	3.282890559296826
2564. jaggers'	iron control over her	any dish she put before him hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling	rests on his having once got her acquitted	of a murder charge by cleverly contriving her sleeves at the trial to	conceal her strength and by passing off the lacerations on the backs	of her hands as the scratches of brambles rather than of human fingernails.	4.173215468926734
2565. it is the similarity between estella's hands and molly's	that provides pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and	establishes a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and	the genteel cruelty of satis house.	3.569165267170449
2566. finally magwitch's pursuit	of compeyson his archenemy and betrayer begins by his holding him	in a vicelike grip on the river flats to frustrate his escape and culminates	in his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him	thus precipitating the death-locked struggle in the water during which	compeyson drowns.	4.477830048779578
2567. magwitch's hand here ironically becomes the agent	of justice.	4.6724501027054846
2568. but only in one of its aspects is great expectations	a tale of violence revenge and retribution.	6.6182689678617646
2569. money so	important a theme elsewhere in dickens is here central and hands are	often associated in some way with the false values- acquisitiveness	snobbery self-interest hypocrisy toadyism irresponsibility injustice-	that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of wealth.	3.3635831713296227
2570. dickens suggests	the economic evils of such a society on the first page	of his novel in the description of pip's five little dead brothers	who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal	struggle who seemed to have all been born on their backs	with their hands in their trousers-pockets and had never taken them	out	in this state of existence.	4.842217318366729
2571. pip's great expectations his	progress through illusion and disillusionment turn somewhat as they	do for the naive hero of dreiser's american tragedy upon	the	lure of genteel prosperity through unearned income- what wemmick calls	portable property and what jaggers reproaches pip for letting	slip through his fingers.	3.113042431664915
2572. since a gentleman	must if possible avoid sullying them by work his hands as importantly	as his accent become the index of social status.	5.130552176600155
2573. almost the first	step in the corruption of pip's values is the unworthy shame he	feels when estella cruelly remarks the coarseness of his hands: they	had never troubled me before but they troubled me now as vulgar	appendages.	3.3119027646840338
2574. pip imagines how estella would look down upon	joe's hands roughened by work in the smithy and the deliberate contrast	between her white hands and his blackened ones is made to symbolize	the opposition of values between which pip struggles- idleness	and work artificiality and naturalness gentility and commonness coldness	and affection- in fact between satis house and the forge.	4.3768964593780995
2575. when the snobbery that alienates pip from joe finally gives way before	the deeper and stronger force of love the reunion is marked by an	embarrassed handshake at which pip exclaims no don't wipe it	off- for god's sake give me your blackened hand!	pip's abject leave-taking of miss havisham during which he kneels	to kiss her hand signalizes his homage to a supposed patroness who	seems to be opening up for him a new world of glamour; when on the	journey to london that immediately follows he pauses nostalgically	to lay his hand upon the finger-post at the end of the village the wooden	pointer symbolically designates a spiritual frontier between innocence	and the corruption of worldly vanity.	3.065710877715331
2576. incidentally one cannot	miss the significance of this gesture for dickens reintroduces it associatively	in pip's mind at another moral and psychological crisis-	his painful recognition in a talk with herbert pocket that his	hopeless attachment to estella is as self-destructive as it is romantic.	4.883726298369852
2577. in both cases the finger-post represents pip's heightened awareness	of contrary magnetisms.	4.995232012157048
2578. a variety of hand movements helps	dramatize the moral climate of the fallen world pip encounters beyond	the forge.	5.667362091139212
2579. the vulturelike attendance of the pocket family upon	miss havisham is summed up in the hypocritical gestures of miss camilla	pocket who puts her hand to her throat in a feigned spasm of	grief-stricken choking then lays it upon her heaving bosom with	an unnatural fortitude of manner and finally kisses it to	miss havisham in a parody of the lady's own mannerism toward estella.	3.073618015009534
2580. pumblechook's hands throughout the novel serve to travesty greed	and hypocritical self-aggrandizement.	5.739974350684024
2581. we first see him shaking mrs	joe's hand on discovering the sizable amount of the premium paid	to her husband for pip's indenture as an apprentice and later pumping	pip's hands for the hundredth time at least	in effusive congratulation to pip on	his expectations.	3.25511140940159
2582. we take leave of pumblechook as he gloats over pip's	loss of fortune extending his hand with a magnificently forgiving	air and exhibiting the same fat five fingers one of which	he identifies with the finger of providence and shakes at pip	in a canting imputation of the latter's ingratitoode and	his own generosity as pip's earliest benefactor.	4.2575030667353335
2583. pip first learns the stupendous power of money from the	sycophantic tailor mr trabb whose brutality to his boy helper exactly	matches	the financial resource of each new customer and whose fawning	hands touch the outside of each elbow and rub	pip out of the shop.	3.3674284239272274
2584. the respectability which money confers implies	a different etiquette and upon taking up the life of a london gentleman	pip must learn from herbert pocket that the spoon is not generally	used over-hand but under.	4.584440355775043
2585. the following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the	operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items:	channel unit combined channel and unit combined arm and file unit	record synchronizers inquiry synchronizers and alteration switches.	3.2344944752712403
2586. the declarative operation equ is used to equate symbolic names	to item numbers.	5.63118571888574
2587. certain autocoder	statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained	in the operand of a single line on the autocoder	coding sheet.	3.6512723635703526
2588. when this is the case the appropriate section of this	manual will indicate that continuation cards may be used.	6.661805226300341
2589. thus	when specifically permitted the operand of a given line on the autocoder	coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to	four additional lines which immediately follow.	3.4160442230177934
2590. the label and	operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand	must begin in column 21; ie it must be left-justified in the	operand column of the coding sheet.	4.667285061932153
2591. the operand need not extend across	the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation	cards but may end with the comma following any parameter.	3.2680496116419313
2592. remarks may	appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they	are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces.	6.1548879944251516
2593. illustration	of the use of continuation cards are included throughout the	examples illustrating the various statements.	4.496372313877282
2594. if a continuation	card follows a statement that does not permit continuation cards	the compiler will generate a nop and issue an error message.	5.556207795268219
2595. additional	restrictions regarding the use of continuation cards with macro-instructions	appear on page 106.	4.795548250448698
2596. electronic switches	the assignment of actual addresses to symbolic	index word and electronic switch names occurs in phase 3 of the	autocoder processor.	4.861416487662795
2597. the initial availability of index words and electronic	switches is determined by a table which is included in the compiler	systems tape.	3.654600125336438
2598. this table originally indicates that index words	1 through 96 and electronic switches 1 through 30 are available for	assignment to symbolic references; index words 97 through 99 are	not available.	4.585766400110222
2599. the initial setting of this table may be altered however	as described in the 70707074 data processing system bulletin	ibm 70707074 compiler system: operating procedure	form j28-6105.	3.3181748516739686
2600. during the first pass of phase 3 references	to the actual addresses of index words and electronic switches	are collected and the availability table is updated.	5.333751433572961
2601. at the end	of this pass the table indicates which index words and electronic switches	are not available for assignment to symbolic references.	3.796769213186821
2602. both index words and electronic switches may have been made unavailable	before the start of assignment in one of the following ways:	the initial setting of the availability table indicated that the	index word or electronic switch was not available for assignment.	5.500001555589773
2603. the one- two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch	was used in the operand of a symbolic machine instruction to specify	indexing or as a parameter which is always an index word or electronic	switch eg   the one- or two-digit number of	the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of an equ	statement eg    when the index words or electronic	switches are reserved because of actual usage in the statements	described above the position or order of the statements within the program	is not important; any such reference will make the index word	or electronic switch unavailable at the end of this pass.	3.2164646417695932
2604. during	the assignment pass of phase 3 index words and electronic switches	are reserved as they are encountered during assignment.	5.677675727989302
2605. index	words and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways.	4.556724863803106
2606. the first two methods apply to both index words and electronic switches;	the third applies only to index words.	5.536084174799315
2607. during the assignment	pass each instruction is examined for reference to the symbolic	name of an index word or electronic switch.	4.2110051882307555
2608. when such a reference	is found an actual address is assigned and the availability table is	changed so that the assigned index word or switch is no longer available	for later assignment.	5.345897023945526
2609. if the one- or two-digit address of	an index word or electronic switch is used or is included in the operand	of an xreserve or sreserve statement	the corresponding index word or electronic switch is reserved.	3.5346594999546803
2610. if a statement has been assigned an address in the index word	area  by means of an	origin statement which refers to an actual address the	corresponding index word will be reserved.	5.158111217937675
2611. these entries should normally	appear at the beginning of the program or immediately following each	litorigin statement.	5.208894926609246
2612. otherwise symbolic names may have	previously been assigned to these same index words.	6.0729446567627745
2613. the preceding methods allow	efficient use of index words and electronic switches during a sectionalized	or multi-phase program particularly when used in conjunction	with the litorigin statement.	3.3189567747104705
2614. extreme caution should	be used however to avoid the conflicting usage of an index word or electronic	switch which may result from the assignment of more than one	name or function to the same address.	5.111760828230261
2615. if the symbolic name or	actual address of an index word or electronic switch appears or is included	in the operand of an xrelease or srelease	statement the specified index word or electronic switch	will again be made available regardless of the method by which it	was reserved.	3.322996349651052
2616. it will not however be used for symbolic assignment until	all other index words or electronic switches have been assigned for	the first time.	5.898928317744477
2617. if at any time during the assignment pass	the compiler finds that there are no more index words available for assignment	the warning message no more index words available	will be placed in the object program listing the table will be altered	to show that index words 1 through 96 are available and the assignment	will continue as before.	3.609946498771787
2618. if the compiler finds that there are	no more electronic switches available for assignment the warning message	no more electronic switches available will be placed in	the object program listing the table will be altered to show that electronic	switches 1 through 30 are available and assignment will continue	as before.	4.627395696314482
2619. the resultant conflicting usage of index words or electronic	switches may be avoided by reducing the number of symbolic names	used eg through the proper use of the equ xrelease	or srelease statements.	3.9558549644649315
2620. as noted in appendix	c index words 97 through 99 are never available for assignment	to symbolic names by the compiler; also index words 93 through	96 may have been made unavailable for assignment.	5.035142386117929
2621. statements	autocoder declarative statements provide the processor	with the necessary information to complete the imperative operations	properly.	3.8849121559715263
2622. declarative statements are never executed in the object program	and should be separated from the program instruction area placed	preferably at its beginning or end.	4.714137561967006
2623. otherwise special care must be	taken to branch around them so that the program will not attempt to execute	something in a data area as an instruction.	3.9102056617741963
2624. if the compiler does	encounter such statements a warning message will be issued.	6.197852301026256
2625. 70707074	autocoder includes the following declarative statements: da	dc drdw	dsw dline	equ code dtf	diocs	and duf.	4.0683852436856025
2626. da dc	dtf and dline require more than one entry.	7.252162285116746
2627. the da statement is used to name and define the positions and	length of fields within an area.	3.709395804549459
2628. the dc statement is used to name	and enter constants into the object program.	5.492517946490919
2629. since the 7070 and 7074	make use of record definition words to read write move	and otherwise examine blocks of storage the da and dc statements	provide the option of generating rdws automatically.	3.511810433270544
2630. when so instructed autocoder will generate one or more rdws	and assign them successive locations immediately preceding the area	with which they are to be associated.	6.030858320170726
2631. an rdw will be of the	form f where xxxx is the starting location of the area and yyyy	is its ending location.	4.277352888440706
2632. these addresses are calculated automatically	by the processor.	7.27148984511837
2633. in some cases it may be more advantageous	to assign locations to rdws associated with da and dc	areas in some other part of storage ie not immediately preceding	the da or dc areas.	3.927671301072172
2634. the drdw statement may be	used for this purpose.	5.650577481330174
2635. the drdw statement may also be used to	generate an rdw defining any area specified by the programmer.	3.7816762416673746
2636. as many as ten digital switches may be named and provided	by the dsw statement for consideration by the setsw and	logic macro-instructions.	5.5410965861943735
2637. each switch occupies one digit position	in a word can be set on or off and is considered	as logically equivalent to an electronic switch.	3.627869846009788
2638. it cannot however	be referred to by electronic switch commands eg esn bsn	etc.	6.313086495667379
2639. an individual switch or the entire set of switches in	a word may be tested or altered as desired.	3.80936245007775

2649. the duf also	supplies the locations of subroutines written by the user that are	unique to the file.	3.50677758235622
2650. a full description of the diocs	dtf and duf statements is contained in the 7070 data processing	system bulletin ibm 7070 inputoutput control system	form j28-6033-1.	5.407528253450359
2651. brief descriptions of these three declarative	statements and detailed descriptions of the formats and functions	of each of the other 70707074 autocoder declarative statements follow	below.	4.095910554837393
2652. when	the inputoutput control system is to be used in a program a	diocs statement must be used to select the major methods of processing	to be used.	6.5374975382738825

2664. in the midwest oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment	of domestic sewage from suburban areas.	5.593931972473908
2665. the high cost of land	and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have	created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational	characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat	more organic matter per unit volume.	3.692928082414203
2666. research at fayette missouri	on oxidation ponds has shown that the bod in the treated	effluent varied from 30 to 53 mgl with loadings from 8 to	120 lb boddayacre.	4.7109898582590555
2667. since experience indicates that effluents	from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these bod	concentrations the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated	treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds.	3.7120759108068073
2668. recent studies by weston and stack had indicated that a turbine	aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen	transfer.	5.34574881953708
2669. their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3	to 4 lb of oxygenhrhp.	4.660089355027404
2670. o'connor and eckenfelder	discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes.	6.581147521563909
2671. they indicated that a 4-day retention aerated lagoon would give 60	to 76 per cent bod reduction.	4.106300382549409
2672. later eckenfelder increased	the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer	months.	6.2199081750369976
2673. it appeared from the limited information available that the	aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity	of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree	of treatment in a smaller volume.	3.624521173746867
2674. with	the development of the red bridge subdivision south of kansas city	missouri the developer was faced with the problem of providing adequate	sewage disposal.	6.575169754391627
2675. the sewage system from kansas city was not	expected to serve the red bridge area for several years.	3.487388510322654
2676. this necessitated	the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with	an expected life from 5 to 15 yr.	5.228155654399123
2677. for the initial development an	oxidation pond was constructed as shown in figure 1.	4.983329210158887
2678. the oxidation pond	has a surface area of 4.	5.650577481330174
2679. 77 acres and a depth of 4 ft.	4.6724501027054846
2680. the pond	is currently serving 1230 persons or 260 persons per acre.	5.187735111958531
2681. in the summer	of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted	obnoxious odors.	4.2488020146845535
2682. it was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the	pond by regular additions of sodium nitrate until the temperature decreased	and the algae population changed from blue-green to green algae.	4.750497075489872
2683. the anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond	necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen	than by sodium nitrate.	3.3564185518874785
2684. at the same time further expansion in the	red bridge subdivision required the construction of additional sewage	treatment facilities.	6.458002924284277
2685. the large land areas required for oxidation	ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer.	3.9172811902434055
2686. it was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the	problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary	treatment for the additional development.	5.638380598617593
2687. the lack	of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompted the developer	to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility	for treating domestic sewage.	3.33646931496923
2688. the pilot plant was a circular lagoon	81 ft in diam at the surface and 65 ft in diam at the bottom	4 ft below the surface with a volume of 121000 gal.	4.400956818388731
2689. the	side slopes were coated with fiberglas matting coated with asphalt to	prevent erosion.	4.0683852436856025
2690. the pilot lagoon was located as shown in figure 1	to serve the area just south of the existing housing area.	5.062135473260568
2691. the major	contributor was a shopping center with houses being added to the system	as the subdivision developed.	3.94493572804161
2692. the pilot lagoon was designed to handle	the wastes from 314 persons with a 4-day aeration period.	4.848279856743894
2693. initially	the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping center with the	domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18-month period.	3.592527040520332
2694. this	operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant with a slowly	increasing load over a reasonable period of time.	4.985333447698777
2695. the pilot	plant was equipped with a 3-hp turbine aerator.	4.339089847010241
2696. the	aerator had a variable-speed drive to permit operation through a range	of speeds.	5.583228874976599
2697. the sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered and	continuously recorded on 24-hr charts.	3.570845587849075
2698. the raw sewage was introduced	directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the	raw sewage with the aeration tank contents.	4.524657308186351
2699. the effluent was collected	through two pipes and discharged to the blue river through a surface	drainage ditch.	3.470558666016351
2700. composite samples were collected at	weekly intervals.	7.163184125958424
2701. the long retention period and the complete mixing	concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent.	4.102246525558196
2702. weekly samples would make any changes more readily discernible	than daily samples.	5.739974350684024
2703. the composite samples were normally collected	over a 6-hr period but an occasional 24-hr composite was made.	3.470558666016351
2704. examination of the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation	of the 6-hr composite samples with 24-hr operations.	5.139404540790458
2705. the	data indicated that the organic load during the 6-hr composites was	essentially 50 per cent of the 24-hr organic load.	4.368021377815322
2706. grab samples	were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its	operating conditions.	5.583228874976599
2707. efforts were made to take the grab samples at	random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6-hr	composite sample.	4.30774910309319
2708. a single 24-hr composite sample indicated that the	sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical.	5.288480479759236
2709. operations	the bod of the influent to the pilot plant varied	between 110 and 710 mgl with an average of 350 mgl.	3.9293402192171936
2710. this was equivalent to 240 mglbod on a 24-hr basis.	6.859434136514463
2711. the	bod of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a	subdivision.	4.285326150552956
2712. the bod in the effluent averaged 58 mgl a 76-per	cent reduction over the 24-hr period.	4.827508206929211
2713. examination of the data	in table 1 shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent	bod.	3.847263205000952
2714. the periods of high effluent bod occurred during	cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted.	4.762804453309085
2715. ice caused the aerator to overload straining the drive belts.	4.317068102383446
2716. the	slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce	oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage.	5.7621067543240345
2717. the	organic loading on the unit averaged 32 lb of bodday or about	2 lb bodday1000 cu ft aeration capacity.	3.632711015013689
2718. needless	to say the organic load was very low on a volumetric basis but was	270 lb boddayacre on a surface loading basis.	4.807873378411027
2719. it seems that	the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly	loaded activated sludge system.	4.218303286579949
2720. the flow rate remained relatively	constant during the winter months as shown in table 1.	5.341250996940546
2721. with	the spring rains the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open	sewers.	4.102132295226146
2722. as construction progresses the volume of storm drainage will	be sharply reduced.	7.131783929225788
2723. the retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged	from 9.	3.9843222565600884
2724. 6 days averaging 6.	8.677302482075584
2725. the large amount	of vegetable grindings from the grocery store in the shopping center	created a suspended solids problem.	3.7356169100354437
2726. the vegetables were not readily metabolized	by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to float on	the surface.	4.653079438027171
2727. a skimming device at the effluent weir prevented loss of	most of these light solids.	3.8552083837030713
2728. the average volatile suspended solids in	the effluent was 75 mgl while mlss averaged 170 mgl	volatile suspended solids.	4.9294672226539955
2729. the average sludge age based on displacement	of solids was calculated to be 14.	3.8463616694480267
2730. the oxygen uptake rate	in the mixed liquor averaged 0.	5.4678654398730995
2731. 8 mglhr during the first	four months of this study.	4.8477274878269
2732. variations in aerator speeds during the latter	two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen	demand.	5.057556181613073
2733. the increase in oxygen uptake rates from 1.	4.935466254965754
2734. 6 mglhr	which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to	be related to resuspension of solids which had settled at the lower	rotor speeds.	5.00730290339166
2735. it appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids	were active microbial solids with the heavier less active solids	settling out.	4.421079472023096
2736. the suspended solids discharged in the effluent	were found to be the major source of the bod.	5.53779239425945
2737. removal of the suspended	solids by a membrane filter yielded an average effluent containing	only 20 mgl bod.	3.744109221929566
2738. the bod in the drainage ditch	receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 mgl.	4.983240996215937
2739. this low bod	was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation	since the only dilution was surface runoff which was very low during	this study.	3.41794617188886
2740. routine microscopic examinations	were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by mckinney and	gram for the various types of protozoa.	5.371513078576806
2741. it was found that the	aerated lagoon was an activated sludge system rather than an oxidation	pond.	4.212905676717951
2742. at no time were algae found in the mixed liquor.	8.250191029480348
2743. the bacteria	formed typical activated sludge floc.	4.484814815711922
2744. the floc particles were all small	as the heavier floc settled out.	5.187735111958531
2745. initially the flagellated	protozoa predominated but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated	protozoa.	4.90305544900944
2746. as the temperature decreased the number of free swimming	ciliated protozoa decreased.	7.85253180921311
2747. very little protozoa activity existed	below 40`f.	6.260548774951739
2748. when the temperature reached 32`f all protozoan	activity ceased; but as the temperature rose the numbers of	protozoa increased rapidly.	5.984762511696929
2749. only once were stalked ciliates found in	the mixed liquor.	5.1298183412245
2750. the predomination of free swimming ciliated protozoa	is indicative of a high bacterial population.	5.1450070816080435
2751. one of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen	transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator.	4.575949596079474
2752. routine determinations	were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen	uptake rates.	5.367289396080528
2753. the data given in table 2 show the routine operation	of the aerator.	3.7002464386011096
2754. the dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently	high until january 29 1961.	4.983240996215937
2755. an extended cold spell caused	ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform	and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water.	3.761446102210694
2756. the added	resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen	transfer capacity.	4.998913848101039
2757. it was approximately one month before the belt	problem was noticed and corrected but at no time was there a deficiency	of dissolved oxygen.	3.7374123583357464
2758. a series of eight special tests were	conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer	rate.	6.196890478910967
2759. five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to	simulate an ice cover.	4.56630136034725
2760. the rate of oxygen transfer at 1.	7.087173553945171
2761. 0-mgl	dissolved oxygen concentration and 10`c for various rotor speeds	is given in table 3.	3.9701983041559052
2762. the maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.	5.650272633457089
2763. 0	mgl dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 lbday at a maximum	rate of 9.	3.9701983041559052
2764. the actual power requirements indicated	2lb oxygen transferhrhp.	6.098086436343504
2765. the polyethylene cover reduced	the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent indicating that the maximum	oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface.	3.634540635817283
2766. pond	during this study septic conditions developed in the	oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted.	5.514665117071654
2767. shortly after this	study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of	sodium nitrate.	4.300319549868837
2768. the location of the oxidation pond in a high-value	residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer.	4.750748492552599
2769. the organic concentration in the influent raw sewage ranged from	160 to 270 mgl of bod with an average of 230 mgl.	3.5905961890002476
2770. the bod data are given in table 4.	5.650577481330174
2771. a single 24-hr composite	sample had a bod of 260 mgl indicating a typical	domestic sewage.	3.8536080872131557
2772. the daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged	147000 gpd giving a retention period of 42 days.	4.704865506850671
2773. the organic	loading on the pond was slightly under 60lbboddayacre.	3.9843222565600884
2774. the effluent bod averaged 34 mgl a little lower	than that of the study at fayette indicated for a loading of 60lb	boddayacre.	4.992936605494873
2775. the bod of the effluent ranged from a	minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47mgl.	3.788015468091796
2776. microscopic examination of	the effluent showed that minimum bod occurred when the algae began	to decrease with cold weather.	5.057556181613073
2777. when the algae began to build up	again the effluent bod rose.	4.786878205016556
2778. during the two weeks when the algae	disappeared from the effluent bod's in the effluent were 18	and 16 mgl.	5.5194517207120235
2779. thus the three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations	are defense of shipping defense of naval forces and area defense.	3.98208871260441
2780. the last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and	near terminals and bases.	5.691691007657431
2781. to effect these operations five elements	exist	fixed installations.	5.423348419931135
2782. surface forces have been used to provide defense	zones around naval and merchant ship formations air to furnish area	surveillance and mines for protection of limited areas.	5.005038670471196
2783. submarines and	shore installations are new elements.	5.219666477665999
2784. the submarine now has a definite	place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to	ocean areas.	4.762782422141702
2785. fixed installations offer possibilities for area detection.	4.913686410369733
2786. mine warfare is being reoriented against submarine targets.	6.412214371980113
2787. a sixth element not always considered is intelligence.	4.618964815664445
2788. it includes	operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment.	7.79282656726
2789. operational intelligence presumably will be available from our	national intelligence agencies; intelligence on the environment will	come from the recently augmented program in oceanography.	3.467766426174774
2790. the major	postwar development is the certainty that these elements should not be	considered singly but in combination and as being mutually supporting.	4.524741011976274
2791. thinking on submarine defense	has not always been clear-cut.	4.6724501027054846
2792. proponents of single elements tend	to ensure predominance of that element without determining if it is justified	and the element with the most enthusiastic and vociferous proponents	has assumed the greatest importance.	5.090046709079396
2793. consequently air surface	and submarine elements overshadow the mine fixed installations	and intelligence.	4.215574404376171
2794. these have sought more and more of what they have.	8.233360385527586
2795. each seems to strive for elimination of the necessity for the others.	4.467112996019944
2796. this despite postwar experience demonstrating that all elements are	necessarily mutually supporting.	5.874336267393343
2797. thus the most productive areas are	not necessarily the most stressed.	5.3266967368183975
2798. this is stated to emphasize the necessity	for an over-all concept of submarine defense one which would	provide positions of relative importance to asw elements based on	projected potentialities.	5.124351896224234
2799. then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements	can be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward a common	objective.	4.1298075888652255
2800. an over-all concept would have other advantages.	7.420998401046182
2801. it would	allow presentation to the public of a unified approach.	5.58615949389162
2802. now the problem	is presented piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily.	7.886847157998231
2803. while one	element	is announcing progress another is delineating its problems.	4.982266224732081
2804. the	result can only be confusion in the public mind.	7.615785351857987
2805. a unified concept	can serve as a guide to budgeting and if public support is gained will	command congressional support.	3.9246312297202706
2806. industry's main criticism of the	navy's antisubmarine effort is that it cannot determine where any	one company or industry can apply its skills and know-how.	5.262167161787179
2807. lacking guidance	industry picks its own areas.	5.753418555381722
2808. the result coupled with the salesmanship	for which american industry is famous is considerable expenditure	of funds and efforts in marginal areas.	5.097680758930345
2809. an over-all concept	will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield	greatest dividends.	4.224004506010002
2810. therefore a broad concept of over-all submarine	defense is needed for co-ordination of the navy's efforts for a logical	presentation to the public for industry's guidance and as a	basis for a program to the congress.	5.088399386915421
2811. concept	that which follows will be a discussion of principles	and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare.	4.1960125076960475
2812. russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world divided	between her various fleets.	6.8979654212949635
2813. some are also in albania and others	are on loan to egypt.	4.7195396680159005
2814. other countries which may willingly or unwillingly	become communist can furnish bases.	6.254968645394336
2815. communist target areas can	be assumed but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide	with soviet intentions.	4.8335697995697755
2816. attack can come from almost any direction against	many locations.	6.144814417540349
2817. logically then the first principle of the plan	must be that it is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical area.	4.575084057535092
2818. it is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while	building at bases in transit and on station.	5.37015738615747
2819. destruction of the enemy's	building and base complex however requires attacks on enemy	territory which is possible only in event of all-out hostilities.	3.808464369558499
2820. in	transit or on station it may not be possible to attack the submarines	until commission of an overt act.	5.814037129664659
2821. the communists are adept at utilizing	hostilities short of general war and will do so whenever it is	to their advantage.	3.6283482901876045
2822. therefore the second principle of the plan must be	that while providing for all-out hostilities its effectiveness is	not dependent on general war.	5.40021769498571
2823. antisubmarine warfare does not involve	clashes between large opposing forces with the decision a result	of a single battle.	3.685338251241182
2824. it is a war of attrition of single actions	of an exchange of losses.	6.746921879130105
2825. this exchange must result in our ending up	with some effective units.	4.280509275523906
2826. initially having fewer units of some elements-	especially submarines- than the opponent our capabilities need	to be sufficiently greater than theirs so that the exchange will	be in our favor.	4.942892431876948
2827. therefore the third principle of the plan must be that	it does not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types	unless at an assured favorable exchange rate.	3.8910197980600616
2828. the submarine	has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since	world war 2.	4.983240996215937
2829. its speed has increased it operates at increasingly	greater depths its submerged endurance is becoming unlimited and	it will become even more silent.	3.689511067769841
2830. the next developments will probably	be in weaponry.	6.757802316104118
2831. the missile can gradually be expected to replace the	torpedo.	4.57187747752113
2832. as detection ranges increase weapons will be developed to	attack other submarines and surface craft at these ranges.	5.511543313018439
2833. therefore	the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously	increasing capabilities in the opponent.	4.13887205000663
2834. no element can accomplish	the total objective of submarine defense.	6.831689567118745
2835. some elements support	the others	but all have limitations.	5.411014586580643
2836. some limitations of one element	can be compensated for by a capability of another.	5.799208642707734
2837. elements used	in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum	of the capabilities of the individual elements.	4.451401458630323
2838. therefore the plan's	fifth principle must be that it capitalize on the capabilities of	all elements in combination.	5.577304145814093
2839. conceivably the submarine defense	problem can be solved by sufficient forces.	4.317068102383446
2840. numbers would be astronomical	and current fiscal policies make this an impractical solution.	5.583228874976599
2841. shipbuilding aircraft procurement and weapon programs indicate that	there will not be enough of anything.	4.358172054902242
2842. therefore any measures taken	in peacetime which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute	greatly to success when hostilities occur.	5.157932635070325
2843. therefore the sixth	principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures	which will reduce future force requirements.	3.966396731292977
2844. the world is constantly	changing; what was new yesterday is obsolescent today.	6.624877928679237
2845. the	seventh principle of the plan is self-evident; it must be flexible enough	to allow for technological breakthroughs scientific progress and	changes in world conditions.	4.089665590825743
2846. to this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense	has been demonstrated the mission has been stated broad principles	delineating its content laid down and the supporting elements listed.	5.230818413892396
2847. before considering these elements in more detail an additional	requirement should be stated.	4.566798315352863
2848. large area coverage will accomplish all	other tasks.	6.837900141796083
2849. therefore because reduction in tasks results in reduction	of forces required the plan should provide for expanding area coverage.	3.8163373800112947
2850. but it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented	geographically.	8.807062037559117
2851. consequently the system giving area coverage	must be flexible and hence at least	partially mobile.	3.9978009921274746
2852. since effective area coverage appears fairly remote	the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements:	air surface sub-surface fixed installations mines and intelligence.	4.9431909299982495
2853. these are arranged approximately in the order of the vociferousness	of their proponents but will be discussed in the reverse order	in the hope that the true order of importance will result.	4.15956230753443
2854. intelligence	as used herein will include information on possible	opponents and on the environment which can affect operations.	5.78198306774963
2855. these can	be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence.	4.927297379958803
2856. in submarine defense these must have maximum stress.	6.7790825342916845
2857. good operational	intelligence can ensure sound planning greatly reduce force	requirements	and increase tactical effectiveness.	4.3975740586657395
2858. environmental intelligence	is just as important.	7.712079578137997
2859. the ocean presently co-operates with the	target.	4.4846074056149545
2860. full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the	environment to our side resulting in an increase in effectiveness of	equipment and tactics a decrease in enemy capabilities and the development	of methods of capitalizing on the environment.	4.754911503346278
2861. therefore improved	intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and as	it supports all other elements rates a top priority.	3.8163373800112947
2862. gathering intelligence	is important but of equal importance is its translation into	usable form.	5.583228874976599
2863. a program is needed to translate the results of oceanographic	research into tactical and operating instructions.	4.226510052075201
2864. approaching	this problem on a statistical basis is invalid because the opponent	has the same sources available and will be encountered not under	average conditions but under the conditions most advantageous to him.	4.709866442330872
2865. therefore the on-the-scene commander must have detailed operating	instructions based on measurement of conditions in the area at the time	of encounter.	4.001045619879388
2866. all capabilities must be used to maximum advantage	then.	8.494183636119088
2867. temperature wind oxygen content depth bottom character and	animal life are the chief environmental variables.	4.101001135460022
2868. variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature	because more of the variables would be encompassed.	5.572859743294759
2869. these variations	must eventually be measured horizontally as well as vertically.	5.609365993842513
2870. progress in predicting water conditions is encouraging but little	guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information.	6.593574432770714
2871. a concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on	the spot.	4.033407084863062
2872. mine warfare has in the past been directed against	surface targets.	7.046665900554924
2873. by its nature it has always been of great psychological	advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater	counter-efforts.	4.16265052451347
2874. mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine	targets.	6.743273855772659
2875. they are still considered to be for use in restricted waters	however and targets must come within a few yards of them.	4.64364100906285
2876. mines	need to be recognized as a major element in anti-submarine warfare employment	extended to deep water and have their effective area per unit	increased.	4.808863338179495
2877. mines can be used to deny access to great areas; they	are difficult to counter cost little to maintain until required and	can be put into place quickly.	3.7580031804816296
2878. a most attractive feature is that detection	and attack are combined in a single package.	5.785596734048386
2879. effective employment	will reduce force requirements.	5.619635421798327
2880. for example effective mine	barriers from florida to cuba and across the yucatan channel from	cuba to mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense	inshore patrol convoy escort shipping control and mine defense for	the entire gulf of mexico.	4.794613836558981
2881. more extended systems covering all passage	into the caribbean would free the caribbean and the gulf of mexico	from the previously listed requirements.	3.7890721399423373
2882. systems covering the gulf	of st lawrence and possibly the entire coasts of the united	states are not impossible.	5.17408758667882
2883. such mine defense systems could permit concentration	of mobile forces in the open oceans with consequent increase	in the probability of success.	4.433184504074426
2884. the advantages inherent in mine warfare	justify as great an importance for this element as is accorded any	of the other elements.	4.5635753977982
2885. fixed installations are increasingly	advocated as the problem of area defense emerges.	4.822592653851154
2886. the proponents	are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence	on their military counterparts.	4.983240996215937
2887. systems which detect submarines over	wide areas are attractive although they can be only burglar alarms.	4.197756569771829
2888. mobile forces are required to localize and attack detected targets	since the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target.	5.308245738398132
2889. such systems	are expensive and are oriented geographically.	5.720075445684095
2890. in an over-all	asw concept dependence on and effort expended for such systems	should be limited to those with proven capabilities.	5.745206334940865
2891. no general installation	should be made until a model installation has been proved and	its maximum capability determined.	4.070983534064018
2892. in addition proposals for fixed installations	should be carefully weighed against a counterpart mobile	system.	6.256867543541517
2893. for fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that	should be inherent in naval systems.	4.115388839437411
2894. the submarine has become	increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system.	5.315929595247935
2895. it operates	in its target's environment and any advantage gained therefrom	by the target is shared by the attacker.	4.242370186433008
2896. but the submarine is a weapon	of ambush and therefore always in danger of being ambushed.	5.845653439722909
2897. two metabolites	which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast	bacteria are biosynthesized from paba.	4.034423850956544
2898. the 7 carbons of paba	are incorporated directly into metabolite 2	.	5.315894470328817
2899. thirty-five of the 36	carbon atoms arise from paba.	4.6724501027054846
2900. all 28 carbons of metabolite 1	arise from paba.	7.200436508448407
2901. metabolite 1 isolated from the medium however showed a lower specific	activity which indicates endogenous synthesis of this metabolite.	3.632711015013689
2902. vigorous acid hydrolysis of metabolite 1 destroyed the	biological activity of the compound and liberated two aryl amines.	5.057556181613073
2903. fragment a has been obtained in crystalline form as a dioxalate salt	and free base.	3.8849121559715263
2904. preliminary evidence tentatively indicates that the	molecule is cleaved at a secondary amide bond.	5.448482501884564
2905. h sloane; chemical studies are being pursued with the cooperation	- research	on esterases in mammalian sera was continued.	3.9530173921806897
2906. one of the most interesting	findings was the extreme sensitivity of plasma arylesterases to	rare earth ions.	6.4574903783651365
2907. the inhibition of the enzyme by very low concentrations	of lanthanum ion is probably the strongest known biological effect	of rare earth salts.	3.366191686151736
2908. various metal ions have been found to protect plasma	arylesterase against inactivation by urea and guanidine.	5.9191469417841684
2909. the effects	can be related to the structure of this -sh enzyme.	4.581894156336711
2910. the non-identity	of serum and red blood cell arylesterase was also established.	5.187735111958531
2911. furthermore the hydrolysis of paraoxon was studied in mammalian	sera and it was found that it is hydrolyzed by albumin	in addition to arylesterase.	4.427833590907086
2912. selective inhibitors can	distinguish the two activities.	7.209563759634995
2913. investigations on the acceleration of	human plasma cholinesterase were carried further.	4.317068102383446
2914. biophysical studies on	- electron-microscopical and physical-chemical	methods were used to demonstrate the renaturation of heat-denatured	collagen and ribonucleic acid.	5.278567654201008
2915. a method	was devised for extracting and purifying soluble earthworm collagen	.	4.274675675810666
2916. it was observed that ewc macromolecules are the	same diameter than	vertebrate tropocollagen.	6.3941449049672485
2917. this unusual collagen also was shown to undergo	a reversible thermal phase transformation.	4.157601580199868
2918. this investigation	involved several aspects.	8.832727531160176
2919. substance z an active urinary	peptide was purified by extraction in organic solvents and repeated	column chromatography; high-voltage electrophoresis and paper chromatography	were used in preliminary structural studies; pharmacological	effects in vitro on isolated surviving organs and in vivo	on blood pressure were assayed; special equipment required for registering	respiration and for recording the contraction of smooth muscles	under various conditions was developed by the instruments section	; and enzymes	which terminate the action of peptides such as bradykinin and perhaps	substance z were studied.	2.9644019934193535
2920. experiments are in progress to develop	ultraviolet spectrophotometric techniques for assaying these enzymes	and for studying their sensitivity to metal ions.	5.011588695126007
2921. c d mackey a g renfrew w b severs	- in a physiochemical study	of seed proteins the globulins of the brazil nut have been investigated.	3.4876075551711407
2922. in addition to the known principal globulin excelsin three	other ultracentrifugally distinct components have been observed.	6.21511348390288
2923. a	water-soluble protein of quite low molecular weight has	also been found in this system and partly characterized.	4.0346407892561285
2924. on the basis of	a differentiability assumption in function space it is possible to prove	that for materials having the property that the stress is given by	a functional of the history of the deformation gradients the classical	theory of infinitesimal viscoelasticity is valid when the deformation	has been infinitesimal for all times in the past.	5.012084196918452
2925. by strengthening	the differentiability assumption it has been possible to derive second	and higher order theories of viscoelasticity.	4.443978375523652
2926. in the second-order	theory one of the normal stress differences can be calculated from the	first-order stress relaxation function.	6.134193012972068
2927. an extensive series of	measurements was made on a high-density polyethylene in a torsion pendulum	instrument using forced sinusoidal oscillation free vibration and	creep measurements over the temperature range of f to 80`c.	3.368133670402786
2928. as many as seven decades of the time scale were thus covered isothermally.	7.695533954224685
2929. the simple time-temperature equivalence valid for many amorphous	systems did not hold here.	4.029623128194705
2930. it was possible however to decompose	the compliance into a sum of a frequency-independent component and two	viscoelastic mechanisms each compatible with the boltzmann superposition	principle and with a consistent set of time-temperature equivalence	factors.	4.916546335482861
2931. and related	- the results of microanalysis of tektites	for gallium and germanium have shown that	these glasses are probably produced from terrestrial	matter by impact of a celestial body.	3.6289089791830347
2932. the galliumgermanium	ratio is higher than that for ordinary igneous metamorphic or sedimentary	matter as a result of selective volatilization of the components	of the tektite.	5.052822314624515
2933. gallium oxide is less volatile than silica	and germanium oxide is more volatile.	4.0683852436856025
2934. australites	give the appearance of a second	melting.	7.828797392333074
2935. in conformity with this conclusion a higher trace gallium	content was found in the portion that has undergone a second	melting.	4.091350971416079
2936. the silicate fractions of stony meteorites show galliumgermanium	ratios similar to those of tektites because they too have undergone	melting at some point in their histories.	4.927439995115954
2937. libyan desert silica-glass	another natural glass is composed of nearly pure silica	and has the same trace germanium content as sands in the area.	3.467766426174774
2938. the gallium	content however has been enhanced five-fold.	5.8743971957932475
2939. this glass is probably	formed from libyan desert sands by comet or stony-meteorite	impact.	4.157601580199868
2940. nickel-iron meteorites with sufficient kinetic energy	to produce large terrestrial-explosion craters may nevertheless melt only	small quantities of material.	5.057556181613073
2941. most of the impact energy is spent	in crushing and fragmentation.	5.468954961715662
2942. when rapid quenching follows melting	impact glasses may result.	7.2504358962210755
2943. these always contain metallic inclusions.	6.162247003720677
2944. impact glasses not containing elemental nickel-iron may have been	produced by stony meteorites or comets.	5.331440467598945
2945. no meteorites have ever been	recovered from paleoexplosion craters and recent craters containing	impact glass have all been produced by metallic meteorites with the exception	of aouelloul crater adrar western sahara desert.	3.424791666635504
2946. this	crater contains impact glass with no metallic inclusions and no meteoritic	material has been recovered.	5.331440467598945
2947. preparation of a coordination compound is often	accomplished by the simple method of reacting a metal salt with a	ligand in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol.	3.3692430454126225
2948. by applying this general	principle a great number of complex compounds of osmium ruthenium	iridium and rhenium with triphenylphosphine triphenylarsine	and triphenylstibine	have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few	years.	5.162921441549801
2949. in the absence of direct evidence to the contrary decomposition of	solvent alcohol and coordination of its fragments to the metal were	not considered following the above heretofore-accepted assumption in	preparative coordination chemistry.	3.6775773169049675
2950. recent work with radiocarbon and	deuterated alcohols as solvents however has given evidence that metal-hydrido	and -carbonyl complexes may be readily formed by reaction	with alcohol in some of these systems.	5.161573024914663
2951. some of the previously reported	compounds have thus been reformulated and a series of new hydrido and	carbonyl compounds discovered the more representative examples being	f f f f and f.	3.9842518050348943
2952. the coordination complexes	formed by transition metals with primary and secondary phosphines and	arsines are being investigated.	4.827508206929211
2953. particular interest	is directed towards the condensation of these ligands with metal	halides to form substituted phosphide or arside complexes.	3.632711015013689
2954. during the	past year these ligands have yielded some unusual five-coordinate complexes	of nickel and some interesting binuclear phosphorus-bridged	complexes of palladium as well as new compounds	of the well-known type f.	5.395280211256575
2955. the structures properties and reactions	of these compounds are being studied.	3.9071558453438637
2956. in another study	chromium-substituted aluminum oxyhydroxides and related species prepared	homogeneously by high-temperature hydrolysis are being characterized	and investigated spectrally in the ultraviolet region with a view	to identification and semiquantitative estimation of the phases formed	under varying preparative conditions.	4.583391083741469
2957. _elasticity	- the theory of elasticity of	gaussian networks has been developed on a more general basis and the	equations of state relating variables of pressure volume temperature	stress and strain have been precisely formulated.	3.3474573139082535
2958. simple elongation	has been treated in detail.	7.163184125958424
2959. the various stress-temperature coefficients	for constancy of volume and strain constancy of pressure and strain	and constancy of pressure and length have been interrelated.	3.391578295440065
2960. the	dilation accompanying elongation and the simultaneously developed anisotropy	of compressibility have been related to the elongation.	5.645357518996942
2961. in continuation	of these theoretical studies a more precise elucidation of	the effects of imperfections in network structure is sought.	3.7446446206850714
2962. chain conformations of polymeric	- recent theoretical work to calculate the dimensions	of polymeric chains by volkenstein and lifson has been extended to include	more general types of chains.	4.675210074125481
2963. the mean-square end-to-end distance	of the polyisobutylene chain has been calculated in reasonable agreement	with values deduced from viscosity data.	3.390604280653994
2964. these studies are being	extended to different polymers to increase our knowledge about the	hindrances to rotation around chain bonds.	5.2118823501734965
2965. the crystallization of copolymers comprising f units interspersed	with a minor percentage of f is limited by the inability of the	crystal lattice characteristic of the former to accommodate the bulky	side group of the latter.	3.4052637300024804
2966. only uninterrupted sequences of the former	are eligible for formation of crystallites.	6.457914896269029
2967. limitations on the lengths	of these sequences diminish the stability of the comparatively short	crystallites which can be formed and this is reflected in a broadening	of the melting range.	3.947540419524605
2968. carefully executed melting studies on this system	permit quantitative estimation of the instability	engendered by reduced crystallite length.	5.138210239895059
2969. the complex morphology of	polycrystalline homopolymers is necessarily dependent on the same factor.	4.38722737147319
2970. hence the present studies offer a possible basis for interpretations	in the latter field.	5.997796768823363
2971. glycerinated	muscle in the presence of the physiological agent.	5.312557677173381
2972. responsible	for delivering energy to the mechanochemically active proteins	of muscle has been shown to undergo a contraction which is highly sensitive	both to temperature and to solvent composition in mixtures of	alcohols and water.	4.456269831088081
2973. experiments carried out over long periods of time	in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the	onset of contraction and its completion are confined to an interval of	several degrees centigrade and to a concentration range of only several	per cent.	3.316529322392553
2974. the contraction therefore partakes of the character of	a phase transition.	5.315929595247935
2975. while atp appears to be necessary for the	occurrence of contraction its presence and enzymatic hydrolysis of it	by the muscle protein myosin are not the only criteria for contraction.	4.158563759745655
2976. one of the principal aims of anionic polymerization techniques	is the synthesis of polymers of extremely narrow molecular weight	distribution.	5.834764045940301
2977. a simple process for the preparation of nearly monodisperse	polystyrene of predictable molecular weight has been developed.	3.71797660683748
2978. the preparation of such products is not new but the systems heretofore	employed in polymerizations have commanded considerable experimental	skill and starting materials of a high purity.	4.481675959529195
2979. in the new process	impurities present in the solvent the monomer and in the	reaction system which would cause deactivation of propagation centers	are rendered inactive prior to polymerization by gradual addition of	initiator a mixture of butyl-lithium and telomeric styryl-lithium at	a temperature low enough to suppress chain growth.	3.4731657907661275
2980. upon completion	of the purging step additional initiator appropriate for the molecular	weight of the sample desired is added and the system is then warmed	to the polymerization temperature at which the reaction is allowed	to go to completion.	4.769126312767803
2981. the predictability of the molecular weights was	found to be within 10% for the polymers prepared with f ratios less	than 1.	3.3253845082477778
2982. contrary to observations with ethers no apparent	change of the reactivity of the chain ends takes place over considerable	periods of time in benzene as solvent.	4.8575258635047955

3100. in this	way a degree of unification of nomenclature symbols and units will be	realized.	6.046901090432695
3101. because individual classes of foods differ in their requirements	for preservation a number of methods have been developed over the years	involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration	fermentation salting chemical treatment canning refrigeration and	freezing.	3.89737168389572
3102. the basic objectives in each instance are to make available	supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter	to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and	insects and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of	harvest or production to areas of consumption.	4.73107488237771
3103. in earlier years	the preservation of food was essentially related to survival.	4.372974062082154
3104. in	the more sophisticated atmosphere of today's developed nations food-preservation	techniques have sought also to bring variety peak freshness	and optimum taste and flavor in foods at reasonable cost to the	comsumer.	4.7333509329714545
3105. with the development of nuclear technology isotopic	materials and machine radiation sources in recent years the possibilities	of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted	the attention of investigators in the united states and throughout	the world.	4.250485872587822
3106. an early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate	answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon dispelled.	5.627786287036887
3107. interest remained however in the possibility that it would serve	as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses	and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing or	without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations.	3.4279843379181387
3108. the chief	factors responsible for the spoilage of fresh foodstuffs are microorganisms	such as bacteria molds and yeasts insects	sprouting and chemical reactions.	4.890670422055402
3109. microorganisms are often	responsible for the rapid spoilage of foods.	4.574358047656773
3110. of special concern is	the growth of bacteria such as clostridium botulinum which generate	poisonous products.	6.101135284216327
3111. enzymatic action in stored food produces changes	which can adversely affect the appearance of food or its palatability.	3.846964104076588
3112. spoilage by chemical action results from the reaction of one group	of components in the food with others or with its environment as in	corrosion of the walls of metal containers or the reaction of fats with	oxygen in the air to produce rancidity.	4.6647336382461635
3113. sprouting is a naturally	occurring phenomenon in stored potatoes onions carrots beets	and similar root vegetables.	3.8849121559715263
3114. insect infestation is a problem of importance	chiefly in stored grain.	6.518614693353166
3115. the presence of parasitic organisms	such as trichinella spiralis in pork introduces another factor which	must be dealt with in food processing.	3.6263626275524823
3116. to permit the storage	of food for long periods of time a method of preservation must accomplish	the destruction of microorganisms and inhibition of enzymatic	action.	5.3905289144755955
3117. the term sterilization applies to methods involving essentially	complete destruction of all microorganisms.	3.809395861547629
3118. food treated in	this manner and protected from recontamination by aseptic methods of packaging	and containment presumably could be stored for long periods without	refrigeration.	5.001742336120245
3119. the process of pasteurization involves milder	and less prolonged heat treatment which accomplishes the destruction	of most but not all of the microorganisms.	4.1751470081943145
3120. less severe thermal	treatment as by blanching or scalding serves to inactivate enzymes.	6.037731258679057
3121. effects of ionizing radiation	ionizing radiation can cause	the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage	or at lower doses can inhibit their action.	3.4350960928305088
3122. it furnishes a means	of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain parasitic	organisms present in meats.	6.0952157432386835
3123. deactivation of enzymes is also	possible although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 mrad	or more.	3.744109221929566
3124. because of undesirable flavors odors colors and generally	low palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude	the inactivation of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation	by the conventional heat-processing methods of blanching.	4.800609648913088
3125. radiation does not retard the chemical spoilage of food.	4.477601198394805
3126. it will	however inhibit the sprouting of potatoes and other root vegetables.	6.379957507003579
3127. the radiation doses required for the preservation of foods	are in the following ranges:  for radiosterilization to destroy	all organisms for long-term preservation- about 4.	3.5288892540801284
3128. 5 mrad for	nonacid foods of low salt content.	7.703185156653452
3129. for radiopasteurization	to partially destroy microorganisms; results vary with types of food	storage conditions and objectives of treatment- commonly of the	order of 0.	3.714556196189282
3130. 2 mrads but up to about 0.	8.688984421874535
3131. for	destruction of insects- about 25000 rads.	5.219666477665999
3132. for inhibiting	the sprouting of root vegetables- 4000 to 10000 rads.	6.380184945172053
3133. preserving foods with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable side	effects particularly at the higher radiation dosages.	3.744109221929566
3134. in this respect	the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized	foods has to date been found to be low in comparison with	fresh and commercially processed foods.	4.997247210885902
3135. a number of foods are quite	acceptable as regards taste and palatability however at dosages substantially	less than sterilization levels.	4.077733353902817
3136. moreover the nutritive value	of irradiated foods apparently undergoes little if any change although	some of the fat-soluble vitamins are affected by sterilization	doses.	5.197045842133396
3137. for irradiation of food the results	obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation	and x-ray gamma and high-energy electron radiation are suitable.	3.760806227569995
3138. aside from availability and economic considerations each has certain	practical advantages; for example gamma rays give deeper penetration	but cannot be focused or collimated whereas unidirectional electron	beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the	food package to be irradiated.	4.647798736572662
3139. selection of a source for commercial irradiation	would involve consideration of numerous factors including required	dose rate load factor throughput convenience safety and most	important costs.	3.4350960928305088
3140. of the potentially useful sources of ionizing	radiations gamma sources cobalt-60 cesium-137 fission products	or a reactor irradiation loop system using a material such as an indium	salt have received most attention for food-preservation systems.	4.771840494244955
3141. of the various particle accelerators the van de graff machines resonant	transformers and linear accelerators are the principal ones available	for commercial use.	4.0458754183765855
3142. costs of the effective energy produced	by these sources is a major obstacle in the development of food-preservation	processes.	6.077467455091562
3143. estimated production costs of radiation energy	from machine and nuclide sources range from $1 to $10 per kwhr.	3.685338251241182
3144. conventional	energy for processing foods is available in the range of	at most a few cents per kwhr for electric power and the equivalent	of a few mills per kwhr for process steam.	4.760675194093627
3145. radiation therefore is	at an initial cost disadvantage even though only 1 to 10 per cent as	much radiation energy as heat energy is required for radiopasteurization	or radiosterilization.	3.591462690718159
3146. what are the possibilities of lowered radiation	production costs for the future?	7.392532263645993
3147.  it has been estimated that for	applications on a megawatt scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood	of 10 cents per kwhr for large-scale accelerators or for	gamma radiation generated in a reactor core.	3.5606746668881533
3148. no comparable reductions	in the cost of nuclide radiation are foreseen.	7.659734702791485
3149. such projections however	appear highly	speculative and the capacities involved are far beyond	those foreseen for food-preservation facilities.	4.160544595616035
3150. because agricultural	activities are seasonal and the areas of production and harvest	of many foods are widely scattered geographically and because of	the high cost of transporting bulk food items any substantial distance	to a central processing location the use of large central processing	stations where low-cost radiation facilities approaching the megawatt	range might be utilized is inherently impracticable.	4.643080804782696
3151. of irradiation preservation of foods	the objective of complete	sterilization of foods is to produce a wholesome and palatable product	capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods	of time.	3.6921048147323567
3152. chief interest in radiosterilization resides in the military	services.	6.934299865841975
3153. for them providing appetizing food under battle or emergency	conditions is a paramount consideration.	4.217123366535278
3154. they require completely	sterile foods capable of being stored without refrigeration preferably	items already cooked and ready to eat.	5.259879187274401
3155. high nutritional value variety	palatability and appetizing appearance are important for reasons	of morale.	4.466343726507149
3156. foods for rear stations which require cooking but no refrigeration	are also of interest.	5.495671946616734
3157. of primary interest are meats.	7.053807932700675
3158. radiopasteurization which produces fewer adverse sensory changes	in food products has potential usefulness in prolonging the keeping	qualities of fresh and refrigerated food items.	4.758972536424235
3159. thus food so processed	might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more	produce at peak freshness and palatability.	3.9377932674031597
3160. commercial interest is chiefly	in this type of treatment as is military interest under peacetime	conditions.	5.820796813416292
3161. the present status of food preservation by ionizing	radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs.	4.101453749095813
3162. the radiation processing of meat has received extensive	investigation.	5.8365087727519045
3163. to date the one meat showing favorable results at	sterilization doses is pork.	4.353362639586338
3164. of particular interest to the military	services is the demonstration that roast pork after radiosterilization	is superior in palatability to available canned pork products.	5.524476387641136
3165. tests	with beef have been largely unsuccessful because of the development	of off-flavors.	4.94289034871194
3166. a prime objective of the army quartermaster corps	program is to find the reasons for beef's low palatability and means	of overcoming it since it is a major and desirable dietary item.	6.120972101739742
3167. partly	because low-level heat treatment is needed to inactivate enzymes	before radiosterilization treated fresh meats have the appearance of	boiled or canned meat.	3.542415248362911
3168. off-flavor is a less severe problem with	the radiopasteurization of meats but problems of commercial acceptability	remain.	5.2288514545018705
3169. moderate radiation doses of from 100000 to 200000 rads	can extend the shelf life of fresh beef from 5 days	to 5 or 6 weeks.	3.4350960928305088
3170. however the problem of consumer acceptability remains.	10.229036253854472
3171. the preradiation blanching process discolors the treated beef	and liquid accumulates in prepackaged cuts.	3.6311862882065773
3172. cooked beef irradiated in	the absence of oxygen assumes an unnatural pink color.	5.583228874976599
3173. when lamb	and mutton are irradiated at substerilization doses the meat becomes	dehydrated the fat become chalky and again unnatural changes in	color occur.	3.716212850671366
3174. ground meats such as fresh pork sausage and hamburger	have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration and radiopasteurization	might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping	qualities.	4.726892725546913
3175. however a major problem here is one of scale of processing;	ground meats are usually prepared from scrap meats at the local	level whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would require	central processing and distribution facilities.	3.627742455766138
3176. the problems of	color change by blanching and liquid accumulation within the package are	the same as for solid cuts.	5.0063508939282935
3177. specialty cooked items containing	meat portions as in frozen dinners might offer a potential use	for radiopasteurization.	3.8101576301595865
3178. the principal potential advantage would be	that the finished product could be transported and stored at lower cost	under refrigeration instead of being frozen.	4.69494750588845
3179. a refrigerated item	could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen	foods of the same type.	3.9070781468504943
3180. competitive processes for preserving	meats are by canning and freezing.	6.144814417540349
3181. costs of canning meat are in the	range of 0.	4.730218267838498
3182. 8 to 5 cents per pound; costs of freezing are in the area	of 2 to 3.	5.825711095173009
3183. the table on page 10 shows costs of canning	and freezing meat and estimated costs for irradiation under certain	assumed conditions.	3.356283604471833
3184. under the conditions of comparison it will	radiosterilization is more	radiopasteurization by either the electron accelerator or cesium-137	irradiation	using the nuclide source is more expensive than use of an electron accelerator.	5.057806141827244
3185. results of irradiation tests with poultry have	been quite successful.	4.477601198394805
3186. at sterilizing doses good palatability results	with a minimum of changes in appearance taste and odor.	6.523145032831951
3187. radiopasteurization	has also been successful and the shelf life of chicken	can be extended to a month or more under refrigerated storage as compared	with about 10 days for the untreated product.	3.447874259749863
3188. acceptable taste and	odor are retained by the irradiated and refrigerated chicken.	5.739974350684024
3189. acceptance	of radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed however for two	reasons: the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration	is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved sanitation	and distributing practices and treatment by antibiotics a measure	already approved by the federal food and drug administration	serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 0.	3.352751291510888
3190. fresh seafood products are extremely	perishable.	7.712079578137997
3191. although refrigeration has served to extend the storage	life of these products substantially increased consumption might be possible	if areas remote from the seacoast could be served adequately.	3.662542432074028
3192. furthermore it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms	possible.	6.212652354945482
3193. the instrument is shown in fig 1 and consists	essentially of a hard sharp tungsten carbide knife which is pushed	along the substrate to remove the coating.	3.4802664519357918
3194. the force required to accomplish	removal is plotted by means of an electronic recorder against	distance of removal.	5.262896677093252
3195. since the removal force is a function of coating	thickness a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into	the instrument to accurately measure film thickness.	3.73707449236254
3196. this too is	recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously	cut.	5.599375982243518
3197. a number of adjustment features are included in the hesiometer	to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited	on such substrates as iron and other metals glass wood and	plastic surfaces.	3.715387655050446
3198. the measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily	be carried out.	5.187735111958531
3199. hesiometer results have been found to compare	excellently with manual knife scratching tests.	4.450498790870961
3200. the instrumental	method however is about 100 times more sensitive and yields numerical	results which can be accurately repeated at wil over a period of time.	4.975427573199364
3201. if a wedge-shaped coating of increasing thickness is removed from	a substrate by an instrument like the hesiometer with a knife of constant	rake angle a number of removal mechanisms are often observed	which depend upon the thickness of the coating.	3.632574623169823
3202. at low thicknesses a	cutting phenomenon is often encountered.	7.4256039461491135
3203. as the coating	becomes thicker the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of	failure.	4.392440692673179
3204. if the coating becomes still thicker a peeling type failure	finally can occur.	6.197852301026256
3205. the typical appearance of these various mechanisms	is illustrated in figs 2 3 and 4 which are single frame enlargements	of high speed movies taken during the course of the knife removal	process.	3.504853765033716
3206. it can be seen from fig 2 that the cutting removal	of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the	coating.	5.943657351968494
3207. the molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are	obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and	failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife	and extending to the coating surface.	3.245106416046471
3208. the pictures of figs	3 and	4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating	is detached by failure in a region at or close to the interface between	coating and substrate.	4.573862664757355
3209. if the force required to remove the	coatings is plotted against film thickness a graph as illustrated schematically	in fig 5 may characteristically result.	3.6978710558109364
3210. here h	is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the	substrate and t is the film thickness.	6.287655034796993
3211. it can be seen that	the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly	from cutting to cracking to peeling removal.	4.6295786502489005
3212. also it can be readily	seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state	response while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature.	5.2865638621510875
3213. it should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the	same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of	changes in coatings thickness.	4.032910876181826
3214. presumably the interfacial bond strength	and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case.	5.488386665647166
3215. what then	are the factors that contribute to these phenomena?	5.041105993244672
3216.  why should	the practical adhesion of a coating as assessed by a knife method	change initially increasing rather rapidly and then decreasing stepwise	to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing	thickness?	4.6009382873232125
3217. 	the	cutting removal process has been previously described.	4.913686410369733
3218. it was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely	by cohesive failure.	6.33819572332023
3219. the details of the removal process are shown	schematically in fig 6.	4.367326842751127
3220. the various forces result from the reaction	of the removed paint chip against the face of the knife and along	the shear plane which makes an angle |f with the substrate.	4.9427112234434665
3221. the	action and reaction forces are r and f respectively and	are equal and opposite in direction.	3.8391522750156133
3222. all the other force vectors are	derived from these.	8.82524138762691
3223. f is the force required to cut a coating of thickness	t from the substrate.	4.14796793674404
3224. f is the shear force along the shear	plane; f and f are the thrust forces acting against coating	and knife respectively; f is the normal compressive force acting	on the shear plane; f is the friction force between chip and knife	surfaces and p is the normal force acting on the face of the	knife.	4.442837948129071
3225. |a is the rake angle of the knife; |f is the angle	the shear plane makes with the substrate; |t is the friction	angle; and |b is the angle the resultants make with the plane of	the substrate.	3.184573767920863
3226. an analysis of the vector relationships shows	that the rake angle |a and the friction angle |t determine	the vector direction f of the force resultants r and f.	5.0661009958218575
3227. consequently	both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction	occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the	knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting	removal process.	3.9396739871604822
3228. it is difficult to measure the direction	and magnitude of r directly.	7.632091061085931
3229. in actual practice the values most	readily amenable to measurement are the cutting force f and the	shear angle |f.	3.744582614387381
3230. these two values and the rake angle |a are	sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships.	5.97209071469877
3231. |a is defined by the geometry of the knife; |f can readily	be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after	cutting from the substrate; f is instrumentally determined.	3.377226354361455
3232. from	fig 6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be	derived and the cutting force is f where |l is the shear strength	of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material w	is the width of the removed coating and t is its thickness.	4.4760919018051055
3233. if the cutting force f is plotted against film thickness	a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope	f.	3.829700672059755
3234. however in the actual assessment of the cutting force by instrumental	methods for any thickness of coating a number of spurious effects	occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured	value larger than the true cutting force indicated by eqn.	5.193410684507444
3235. one of these is the fact that the knife employed no	matter how well sharpened will have a slightly rounded cutting edge.	5.412663734840824
3236. this signifies that |a the rake angle is no longer a constant	to zero film thickness.	5.958883887122088
3237. the curvature of this bluntness is in the	case of the carboloy knife employed in the hesiometer determined by	the grain sizes of the polished grit and the tungsten carbide crystals	cemented together in the knife body and is in the order of 0.	3.58278950791345
3238. the force vector concept of fig 6 can readily be	applied to this condition also.	4.996763569575902
3239. because the rake angle f at the tip	of the knife is very much smaller when compared	to the value of |a for the major portion of the knife a very rapid	increase in cutting force with thickness will result.	4.013698871076298
3240. this reduces	to the relationship: f where f is the intercept at zero thickness	of the extrapolation of the slope indicated in eqn f is the	thickness of the coating equivalent to the rounding off of the knife	tip f is a straight line first approximation of this roundness and	the other symbols are equivalent to those of eqn.	4.360973678432774
3241. it can be	seen that f is a constant and is determined for the most part by the	geometry of the knife.	4.489233236759232
3242. the blunter the knife the higher is the value	of f.	5.315964723648707
3243. the importance of a hard abrasion resistant knife material	like the carboloy employed in the hesiometer immediately becomes	apparent.	3.7425874631379026
3244. softer knives would blunt very rapidly making the value of	f inexact.	5.739974350684024
3245. in extreme cases of very soft knives this value may even	change during the course of a measurement.	4.33011930037583
3246. a second	factor which enters into the practical measurement of the instrumentally	determined cutting force is the frictional resistance caused	by the bottom of the knife against the substrate.	4.914292774796128
3247. this is not a constant	value like f but varies with the thickness of the coating and the	direction and magnitude of the resultants r and f of fig	6.	4.021619853623667
3248. under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip exerts a thrust	f against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or	lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of f.	5.306741252869122
3249. the resultant friction force f is thus directly proportional to	f and consequently also to film thickness.	3.5136449925455984
3250. the value of f	can readily be assessed by determining the frictional force exerted	on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track	under various external loadings.	4.751628944678266
3251. a straight line relationship is usually	observed in a plot of f against load l having slope k	and f since the load l under actual cutting conditions	is caused by f it can be seen that f   the measured force	h in cutting removal of coatings from their substrates consequently	can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the	coating f that due to the bluntness of the knife f and that due	to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate f	or f the first two forces are directly interrelated and depend	upon film thickness whereas f is independent of these two and is a	constant for a given knifecoating combination.	3.24762636385427
3252. these theoretical	relationships are more clearly illustrated in fig 7 and their	sum can be seen to correlate in form with practical measurements made	with the hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion of fig 5	for the cutting mechanism.	5.209418098910719
3253. although a large number of coatings systems	particularly at low thicknesses fail cohesively by the cutting mechanism	frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place.	3.87377933297426
3254. this is a chipping dynamic type failure encountered with very brittle	coatings resins or very highly pigmented films.	5.730297351973404
3255. this is shown in	the photomicrograph of fig 8.	5.624161514373753
3256. the basic difference between	the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the chipping mechanism	is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously	without fracture rupture intermittently occurs along the	shear plane.	5.057777654965525
3257. the detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been	studied extensively by merchant for metal cutting and the principles	found can be directly applied to coatings.	3.4996159588466034
3258. by studying	high speed movies made of this type of failure the sequence of relationships	as schematically illustrated in fig 9 could be observed.	5.7393804453194255
3259. in the first picture the knife is just beginning to advance	into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip	formation.	4.223400479719509
3260. in the next the shear plane angle is high and extends to	the inclined work surface.	6.200647887594149
3261. with increasing advance of the knife into	the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear	angle rapidly decreases.	3.8189102812064895
3262. eventually rupture occurs along the shear	plane and the cycle repeats itself.	6.093948014284733
3263. merchant	has found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry	and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be	applied to the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper values	of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional	area are used.	3.4948374897599823
3264. consequently if the shear angle |f	is replaced by the rupture angle f the relationships as described in	eqns will directly apply.	4.8853331429788245
3265. mechanism	under equilibrium cutting conditions the chip exerts a	force f against the coating and an equal opposite force f against	the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in fig 6.	3.571742060284719
3266. if the	rake angle |a of the knife is high enough and the friction angle	|t between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low	enough to give a positive value for f the resultant vector r	will lie above the plane of the substrate.	5.089600888581
3267. within only a few years foamed plastics materials have managed	to grow into an integral and important phase of the plastics industry-	and the end is still not yet in sight.	4.143329243308476
3268. urethane foam as only	one example was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955.	6.213368859904621
3269. yet last year's volume probably topped 100 million lb and expectations	are for a market of 275 million lb by 1964.	3.752096856073502
3270. many of the other	foamed plastics particularly the styrenes show similar growth potential.	7.0042770915827255
3271. and there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be	evaluated.	5.323082925784165
3272. as this issue goes to press for example one manufacturer	has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength;	another reports that a cellular polypropylene primarily for use	in wire coating applications is being investigated.	4.606353943321698
3273. on the	following pages each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described	in detail as to properties applications and methods of processing.	4.44124887148764
3274. it might be well to point out however some of the newer	developments that have taken place within the past few months which	might have a bearing on the future of the various foamed plastics involved.	6.317495337577415
3275. in urethane foams for example there has been a definite trend	toward the polyether-type materials	and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot	molding.	4.325053066318012
3276. most manufacturers also seem to be concentrating on formulating	fire-resistant or self-extinguishing grades of urethane foam that	are aimed specifically at the burgeoning building markets.	5.459496484590873
3277. urethane	foam as an insulator is also coming in for a good deal of attention.	4.86484678568347
3278. in one outstanding example whirlpool corp found that by switching	to urethane foam insulation they could increase the storage capacity	of gas refrigerators to make them competitive with electric models.	4.9526986744138
3279. much interest has also been expressed in new techniques for processing	the urethane foams including spraying frothing and molding	.	3.9880910045370443
3280. and in meeting the demands for urethane	foam as a garment interlining new adhesives and new methods of laminating	foam to a substrate have been developed.	5.118375234736492
3281. new techniques	for automatic molding of expandable styrene beads have helped boost	that particular material into a number of new consumer applications including	picnic chests beverage coolers flower pots and flotation-type	swimming toys.	3.7818862691277446
3282. two other end-use areas which contributed to expandable	styrene's growth during the year were packaging	and foamed-core building panels.	5.888051614991359
3283. extruded expandable styrene film or sheet- claimed to be competitive	price-wise with paper- also showed much potential particularly	for packaging.	3.7281392210816526
3284. sandwich panels for building utility shelters that	consist of kraft paper skins and rigid styrene foam cores also aroused	interest in the construction field.	4.832679238254104
3285. in vinyl foam the big news	was the development of techniques for coating fabrics with the material	.	4.55011472603122
3286. better hand a more luxurious	feel and better insulating properties were claimed to be the result.	6.437132432883428
3287. several companies also saw possibilities in using the technique for	extruding or molding vinyl products with a slight cellular core that	would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end	product to any great extent.	3.514674540585967
3288. readers interested in additional	information on foams are referred to the foamed plastics chart appearing	in the technical data section and to the list of references which	appears below.	5.539718844858022
3289. since the mid 1950s when	urethane foam first made its appearance in the american market growth	has been little short of fantastic.	4.165152140909061
3290. present estimates are that production	topped the 100-million-lb mark in 1960	; by 1965 production	may range from 200 to 350 million lb for flexible and from 115	to 150 million lb for rigid.	4.502563902763654
3291. the markets that have started to open	up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations.	3.790378093213634
3292. furniture upholstery as just one example can easily take millions	of pounds; foamed refrigerator insulation is under intensive evaluation	by every major manufacturer; and use of the foam for garment	interlining is only now getting off the ground with volume potential	in the offing.	4.796959660725351
3293. urethane foams are basically	reaction products of hydroxyl-rich materials and polyisocyanates	.	4.317068102383446
3294. blowing can be either one of two types-	carbon dioxide gas generated by the reaction of water on the polyisocyanate	or mechanical blowing through the use of a low-boiling liquid	such as a fluorinated hydrocarbon.	5.3312785344801386
3295. the most important factor	in determining what properties the end-product will have is quite naturally	the type of hydroxyl-rich compound that is used in its production.	3.8843782817810037
3296. originally the main types used were various compositions of polyesters.	5.9245075971793435
3297. these are still in wide use today particularly in semi-rigid	formulations for such applications as cores for sandwich-type structural	panels foamed-in-place insulation automotive safety padding arm	rests etc.	3.623798338523729
3298. more recently polyethers- again in varied compositions	molecular weights and branching- have come into use at first	for the flexible foams just lately for the rigids.	5.157430675302023
3299. the polyether glycols	are claimed to give flexible urethanes a spring-back action which	is much desired in cushioning.	3.470558666016351
3300. although the first polyether foams	on the market had to be produced by the two-step prepolymer method	today thanks to new catalysts they can be produced by a one-shot	technique.	5.6031718411904885
3301. it is possible that the polyether foams may soon be molded	on a production basis in low-cost molds with more intricate contours	and with superior properties to latex foam.	3.7466623082578794
3302. the polyester urethane	foam is generally produced with adipic acid polyesters; the polyether	group generally consists of foams produced with polypropylene glycol	one shot vs	prepolymer the isocyanate and resin are	mixed anhydrously and no foaming occurs.	4.249873750267645
3303. the foaming can be accomplished	at some future time at a different location by the addition of the	correct proportion of catalyst in solution.	3.4157806269568867
3304. in one-shot the isocyanate	polyester or polyether resin catalyst and other additives are	mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately.	5.065211756410195
3305. basically this means	that simpler processing equipment	and less external heat	are required in one-shot foaming although	at the same time the problems of controlling the conditions of	one-shot foaming are critical ones.	3.8515884430421434
3306. most commercial	uses of urethane foams require densities between 2 and 30 lbcu	ft for rigid foams between 1 and 3 lbcu ft for flexible	foams.	5.005439292576382
3307. this latter figure compares with latex foam rubber at an average	of 5.	4.240982242257235
3308. 5 lbcu ft in commercial grades.	8.926904300794147
3309. graph in fig 1 p 392 indicates how the ratio of	compressive strength to density varies as the latter is increased or	decreased.	3.702002326053197
3310. the single curve line represents a specific formulation in	a test example.	5.434136986289767
3311. by varying the formula this curve may be moved forward	or backward along the coordinates to produce any desired compression	strengthdensity ratio.	3.738879354109094
3312. in flexible urethane foams we are referring to the range	between the highest and lowest temperatures under which the materials'	primary performance remains functionally useful.	4.832160076236708
3313. in temperature	resistance this quality is usually related to specific properties	eg flexural tensile strengths etc.	4.031714729494489
3314. thermal conductivity is	directly traceable to the material's porous air-cell construction	which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which	forms its composition.	4.63479892887524
3315. these air or gas bubbles make highly functional	thermal barriers.	4.772645226522347
3316. the k factor a term used to denote the rate	of heat transmission through a material	ranges from 0.	4.705010556909502
3317. 28	for flexible urethane foams and from 0.	4.913686410369733
3318. 16 for rigid urethane	foams depending upon the formulation density cell size and nature	of blowing agents used.	5.2791556109739926
3319. table 1 p 394 shows a comparison of	k factor ratings of a number of commercial insulating materials	flexural	this term refers to the ability of a material	to resist bending stress and is determined by measuring the load required	to cause failure by bending.	3.504394526684934
3320. the higher-density urethane semi-rigid	foams usually have stronger flex fatigue resistance ie the	12 lbcu ft foam has 8 times the flexural strength of the	3 lbcu ft density.	4.3726801332184495
3321. note that flexural strength is not always	improved by simply increasing the density nor is the change always	proportional from one formulation to another.	3.801375585161088
3322. where flexural strength	is an important factor be sure that your urethane foam processor is	aware of it.	6.21477587420399
3323. this property refers to the greatest	longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tearing	apart.	4.189492274339997
3324. like compression strength of urethane foams it has a direct	relationship to formulation.	6.946590800885546
3325. exceptional tensile strength is another	of urethane foam's strong features.	4.477601198394805
3326. figure 2 above shows the	aging properties of urethane foams as determined by the percent of change	processing	there are many ways of producing a foamed urethane	product.	5.01025503554799
3327. the foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape it	can be molded it can be poured-in-place it can be applied by spray	guns etc.	4.042002081538324
3328. slab stock is still one of the most important forms	of urethane end-product in use today.	7.137731453367336
3329. basically the foam machines	that produce such stock consist of two or more pumping units a variable	mixer a nozzle carriage assembly and in many cases a conveyor	belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process	and until it solidifies into foam.	3.383700425238144
3330. the ingredients are fed from tanks	through a hose and into the mixer at a predetermined rate.	4.897710150558751
3331. the mixing	head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the receptacle.	3.93284360235178
3332. it only takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed	and after a short cure the material can be cut into lengths as desired.	5.58929828639205
3333. much has been done in the way of ingenious slitters to fabricate	the slab stock into finished products.	5.388379385945414
3334. profile cutting machines	are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce	sine triangle trapezoid and other profiles in variable heights	dimensions etc.	4.714137561967006
3335. the convoluted sheets can be combined to attain	certain cushioning effects mechanically rather than chemically.	3.645842726860676
3336. also	available is a slitter which peels the inside of a folded block	of foam and can be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 yd in	length down to 116 in thick.	5.240913995255013
3337. the low cost and ease of fabrication	of the dies for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide	variety of shapes dimensions and contours that can be tailor-made to	customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case	liners materials handling containers packaging and cushioning devices	and such novelties as soap dishes toys head rests arch supports	and gas pedal covers.	3.0795644113043177
3338. although slab stock appeared	first it soon became apparent that for the production of cushions with	irregular shapes crowned contours or rounded edges the cutting of	slab stock is a wasteful and uneconomical process.	5.225929072274772
3339. only by resorting	to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily	in the established cushion market.	4.006864582537039
3340. the closed molding	of flexible urethane foams has been a problem ever since the introduction	of the material.	5.640997346640265
3341. satisfactory methods for polyester foams and even prepolymer polyether	foams were never fully achieved.	3.9701983041559052
3342. closed molding generally resulted	in parts weighing more than parts fabricated	from free-blown foams.	5.583228874976599
3343. this counteracted the gain from having no scrap	loss.	4.809564317192014
3344. in addition there were difficulties with the flow and spreading	of the foam mixture over the mold surface trouble with lack of	gel strength in the rising foam and problems of splits.	4.99777939196354
3345. the introduction	of one-shot polyether foam systems aided by the development of	new catalysts helped to alleviate some of the problems of closed molding.	4.038971498007191
3346. while there are still many bugs to be ironed out the technique	is fast developing.	5.757039204312147
3347. simple systems are available	that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured pumped	etc into a void where they foam up to fill the void.	3.6892317070518126
3348. in a	typical application- the making of rigid urethane foam sandwich panels-	an amount of foam mixture calculated to expand 10 to 20% more	than the volume of the panel is poured into the panel void and the top	of the panel is locked in place by a jig.	4.815779028301762
3349. temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85-90`f	.	4.182602481535312
3350. the top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs.	6.205065979865934
3351. sixty	lbs loading is possible but 40 lbs is adequate.	4.477601198394805
3352. the suds	box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain	pipe and the machine is started.	4.863177710166195
3353. the 160-ml bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is	applied slowly and directly to the running specimen.	3.6215252841848713
3354. washing is continued	for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips	or passes through the squeeze rolls.	5.660067565571151
3355. at the conclusion of the washing	8 liters of water at 90`f are automatically metered	from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs 4 liters to each tub.	3.7416760790132213
3356. this operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes.	6.863656724864975
3357. during the rinsing	operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow	from the main drain begins.	4.2116595042476535
3358. at this point the drains are readjusted so	that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line	and the main tub drain is set at the 2-12 mark on the drain gauge.	4.873937263656402
3359. when	all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the	main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs.	3.439951842960958
3360. the	run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line.	6.048852170511314
3361. by this procedure rinsing progresses in two stages first	by dilution until the time when the drains are separated and thereafter	by displacement of the soil-bearing liquor by clean rinse water since	soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the nip passes directly	to waste from the suds box drains.	3.388189879845037
3362. this method of rinsing appears	to produce maximum cleansing with minimum soil redeposition.	6.018514931461891
3363. evaluation and classification	evaluation may be made on	either a soil-removal or a grease-removal basis as desired.	3.9266446471601153
3364. a	reflectance-measuring	instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning whereas	soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal.	5.593394783462438
3365. this test method is intended for determining	the dimensional changes of woven or knitted fabrics made of fibers other	than wool to be expected when the cloth is subjected to laundering	procedures commonly used in the commercial laundry and the home.	3.4797217197485337
3366. four	washing test procedures are established varying in severity from very	severe to very mild and are intended to cover the range of practical	washing from commercial procedure to hand washing.	4.846415608100025
3367. five drying test	procedures are established to cover the range of drying techniques	used in the home and commercial laundry.	4.460906897110169
3368. three methods for determining	the dimensional restorability characteristics are established for those	textiles which require restoration by ironing or wearing after laundering.	5.177245201215648
3369. these tests are not accelerated and must be repeated to evaluate	dimensional changes after repeated launderings.	4.285228348033511
3370. table 1	summarizes all of the various washing drying and restoration procedures	available.	7.20919050756979
3371. the person using these tests must determine which combination	of procedures is practical for any specific item in order to	evaluate the dimensional changes of textile fabrics or garments after	laundering procedures commonly used in the home or commercial laundry.	3.365720047661747
3372. it is possible to identify the test procedure completely with a code	consisting of a roman numeral a letter and an arabic number.	5.449069897398483
3373. for	example test 3 e 1 refers to a specimen which has been washed	by procedure 3	in the machine has been dried in a tumble dryer by procedure e	and has been subjected to restorative forces on the tension	presser by procedure 1.	3.359286957192619

3397. a special template	is furnished with the apparatus to enable marking a specimen for	a central measuring area and the fabric extensions to the clamps	knit shrinkage gauge- consisting of a set of 20 mounting	each pin is individually	sprung to a tensioning member which is driven outwardly in	the slot.	3.1971157128209424
3398. the springs have an extension of 1 inch at f tension.	5.357004722923128
3399. the	tensioning members have a common drive so that the application of restorative	force takes place simultaneously in all directions in the plane	of the test specimen.	3.9730962690619753
3400. the minimum diameter of the pin frame in the	collapsed state is 11 inches and the maximum diameter in the freely	extended state is 14 inches.	4.705843146691714
3401. the surface of the apparatus	in contact with the test specimen is uncluttered and polished so as	to be as friction-free as possible.	3.911571626503678
3402. the preparation	of test specimens will vary depending upon the type of dimensional	restorability procedure to be used.	5.330300087741592
3403. three specimens	for each sample to be tested are required in order to arrive at a satisfactory	average of performance.	4.606762769807221
3404. this is especially true for knitted	fabrics.	9.521193529620852
3405. specimens are allowed to reach moisture equilibrium with	a standard atmosphere of f and f and then laid out without tension	on a flat polished surface care being taken that the fabric is	free from wrinkles or creases.	3.362576198393247
3406. fabrics that are badly distorted in their	unlaundered state due to faulty finishing may give deceptive dimensional	change results when laundered by any procedure.	4.758972536424235
3407. this also holds	true	if restorative forces are applied.	5.144909347275827
3408. therefore it is recommended that	in such cases the sample be replaced or if used the results of dimensional	change or dimensional restorability tests be considered as indicative	only.	5.240924052076498
3409. generally it is necessary to mark distances on	a specimen in both lengthwise and widthwise directions and	to measure before and after laundering.	4.092202966340254
3410. the distances may be marked	with indelible ink and a fine-point pen by sewing fine threads into	the fabric or by a specially designed stamping machine.	4.512810719368883
3411. the marked distances	are parallel to the respective yarns.	4.531786737406802
3412. usually the greater the	original distances marked the greater will be the accuracy of the	woven	fabrics to be dried by procedure b or restored by	the specimen of fabric is a rectangle	at least 22 by 22 inches except for cloth narrower than 22 inches	in which case the specimen is the entire width of the fabric.	4.5482116680651945
3413. three	distances each at least 18 inches are measured and marked off parallel	to each of the warp and filling directions.	3.902568714082147
3414. the distances are at	woven or warp knitted	each specimen is at least 25 inches by 25 inches.	5.234993217989711
3415. place the template	on the fabric so that the sides of the 10 inch square	cut out of the template are parallel to the warp and filling for woven	fabrics or the wales and courses for knitted fabrics and so that the	same amount of fabric extends beyond the edges of the template on all	sides.	3.8318220961681893
3416. mark the specimen at the outer edges of the template with pen	and indelible ink; also place three dots on the specimen at each	side of the 10 inch square one dot at midpoint and one at approximately	circular knitted	fabrics to be subjected to restorative procedure 2	each specimen is approximately 16 inches square.	4.399717707504871
3417. the markings	consist of a centrally located 10 inch diameter measuring circle	and a 14 inch diameter circle of 20 dots equidistantly spaced	.	3.2970866817098714
3418. critical measurements in length and width	directions should be taken before and after washing drying and restorative	procedures.	5.576991435402112
3419. the washing	procedures are summarized in table 2.	4.280553672808819
3420. place the specimen	in the wash wheel with sufficient other similar fabric to make a dry	load of f pounds.	6.125176656831724
3421. start the wash wheel and note the time.	5.34294564097048
3422. immediately	add water at 100-105`f to the wheel to a level	of f inches; this level will be increased by condensed steam.	5.04218359480053
3423. when this water level has been reached inject steam into the wheel until	the temperature reaches that shown in column b of table 2.	3.7587896303043067
3424. add sufficient soap	to furnish a good running suds or if desired use a synthetic detergent.	5.605051276662908
3425. stop the wash wheel at the end of the	time	shown in column a of table 2 and drain.	4.291399535750709
3426. refill the machine	to a level of f inches with water at 100-109` f	and start the machine.	5.138210239895059
3427. inject steam if necessary to reach the	temperature shown in column d of table 2.	4.007064041846675
3428. again stop the machine	at the end of the time shown in column c of table 2.	7.400720881526557
3429. this procedure is repeated for the second rinse using the temperatures	tests	2 3	- run the machine continuously until completion	of the test.	4.015442723003187
3430. drain off the soap solution of the suds cycle at such	a time that the wheel has become substantially empty of soap and water	at the end of the time shown in column a of table 2 measured	from the time the wash wheel was started.	5.164408146960272
3431. refill the machine to a	level of f inches with water at 100-109` f.	3.9701983041559052
3432. when this water level has been reached inject steam until the temperature	is that shown in column d.	5.67837254839376
3433. drain off the water at such a time	that the wheel has become substantially empty of water at the end	of the sum of the times shown in columns a and c measured from	the time the wash wheel was started.	3.4945735221796355
3434. immediately refill to a level	of f inches with water at 100-109` f.	5.929556912710734
3435. when	this water level has been reached inject steam until the temperature is	that shown in column f.	3.744109221929566
3436. drain off the water at such a time that	the wheel has become substantially empty of water at the end of the	sum of the times shown in columns a c and e measured from	the time the wash wheel was started.	4.9152334910029944
3437. high-gain photoelectronic image intensification is applied under	conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time	required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of	practicability.	3.3515864650355898
3438. examples of such situations are night reconnaissance	the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues	special radiography in medical or industrial applications track recording	of high energy particles etc.	4.566786271575569
3439. high-gain photoelectronic	image intensification may be achieved by several methods; some of	cascading single stages by coupling	lens systems	image intensifier based upon the multipactor	transmission secondary electron multiplication	cascading of single	stages enclosed in one common envelope.	3.3150269316597085
3440. cascading single stages	by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems	limit the obtainable gain quite severely.	4.985333447698777
3441. channel-type image intensifiers	are capable of achieving high-gain values; suffer however	from an inherently low resolution.	3.8849121559715263
3442. image intensifiers based upon	the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable	resolution is concerned.	5.742551335066376
3443. however the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts	the effective gain.	5.730525374321069
3444. tsem tubes have been constructed showing	high gain and resolution.	6.144814417540349
3445. however electrostatic focus important	for many applications has not been realized for these devices.	4.795670060030977
3446. resolution	limitations with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to	chromatic aberrations.	5.9245075971793435
3447. furthermore the thin film dynodes appear to	have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support cannot be	tolerated.	3.899646889934861
3448. cascaded single stages enclosed by a common envelope	have been constructed with high gain and high resolution.	5.254645499078215
3449. these	tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system	and in the design of the coupling members.	4.339222921423539
3450. the electron optical system	may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one.	5.187735111958531
3451. the magnification	may be smaller equal or larger than unity.	3.9843222565600884
3452. an electrostatic	system suffers generally from image plane curvature leading to defocusing	in the peripheral image region if a flat viewing screen	is utilized while a magnetic system requires accurate	adjustment of the solenoid which is heavy and bulky.	4.489992563236836
3453. as it will be discussed	later peripheral defocusing can be improved on by utilizing	curved fiber couplers.	5.186592271206678
3454. it should be noted however that the paraxial	resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems.	7.013399000349424
3455. it is felt that fiber-coupled double- stage image intensifiers	will gain considerable importance in the future.	4.054222623975651
3456. therefore we	shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities	of such tubes.	5.6626479964214775
3457. the luminous efficiency and resolution of single	stages fiber couplers and finally of the composite tube will be	computed.	3.428445430010395
3458. it will be shown theoretically that the high image	intensification obtainable with such a tube and contact photography permits	the utilization of extremely low incident light levels.	5.450676999683663
3459. the effect	of device and quantum noise associated with such low input levels	will be described.	3.570845587849075
3460. after these theoretical considerations constructional	details of a fiber-coupled double-stage x-ray image	intensifier will be discussed.	5.802848780715651
3461. measured performance characteristics	for this experimental tube will be listed.	4.477601198394805
3462. the conclusion shall	be reached that fiber-coupled double-stage tubes represent a sensible	and practical approach to high-gain image intensification.	4.704906939686849
3463. design of a fiber-coupled double-stage image intensifier	the tube	design which forms the basis of the theoretical discussion shall	be described now.	4.206284687072347
3464. the electron optical system is	based in principle on the focusing action of concentric spherical cathode	and anode surfaces.	4.705010556909502
3465. the inner anode sphere is pierced elongated	into a cup and terminated by the phosphor screen.	3.6898868056813567
3466. the photoelectrons	emitted from a circular segment of the cathode sphere are focused	by the positive lens action of the two concentric spheres pass through	the negative lens formed by the anode aperture and impinge	upon the cathodoluminescent viewing screen.	4.535875650672287
3467. the cylindrical focusing	electrode permits adjustment of the positive lens part by varying the	focusing potential.	3.6881313763154604
3468. the anode potential codetermines the gain g	and magnification m of the stage.	5.078074081494962
3469. both the photocathode	and the image plane of such an electrode configuration are curved	concave as seen from the anode aperture.	4.23404425537114
3470. the field-flattening property	of the biconcave fiber coupler can be utilized to alleviate the	peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat phosphor-screen or	coupling member.	4.489187264353258
3471. for the same reason the output fiber plate is planoconcave	its exposed flat side permitting contact photography if a permanent	record is desired.	4.081172711385856
3472. as it will be shown later the field-flattening	properties of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed	the main advantage of such a design.	6.288565107450206
3473. the second photocathode	and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate substrates.	4.070500180461246
3474. the photocathode sensitivities s phosphor efficiencies	p and anode potentials v of the individual stages shall	be distinguished by means of subscripts 1 and 2 in the text	where required.	5.000962961879726
3475. both stages are assumed to have unity magnification.	5.262509732279745
3476. _flux gain of a single	stage	to a first approximation given by the product of the photocathode	sensitivity s	and the phosphor conversion efficiency p.	5.559967002230785
3477. in	general p is a function of v and the current density	but it shall here be assumed as a constant.	3.6813990308855877
3478. the luminous	efficiency f of a photocathode depends on the maximum radiant	sensitivity f and on the spectral distribution of the incident light	f by the relation: f where f h normalized radiant photocathode	sensitivity.	4.861774405333188
3479. f h standard visibility function.	6.06503597428023
3480. the luminous flux	gain of a single stage is given by: f if the input light distribution	falls beyond the visible range f as expected since f.	4.398528065430878
3481. such	cases are not considered here.	5.619635421798327
3482. the numerical aperture of the fibers	is given by: f where f.	5.187735111958531
3483. the angle f is measured in	the medium of index f.	3.873635296338494
3484. settled phosphors as generally used in image	intensifiers have low optical contact with the substrate surface	hence f shall be assumed.	5.283927790218128
3485. the numerical aperture should be in general	close to unity.	4.434698496857116
3486. this condition can be satisfied eg with f	and f or equivalent glass combinations.	5.560545953279203
3487. a sufficiently good	approximation for determining the end reflection losses r	can be	obtained from the angle independent fresnel formula: f for phosphor	to fiber and fiber to air surfaces and assuming f we obtain	f percent.	3.2350604233864697
3488. this value may be reduced to 4.	7.655742370440411
3489. 6 percent by means of a	glass layer of index 1.	5.055644639026809
3490. hence the f factor for the output	fiber coupler is f.	6.6579106710264355
3491. as the index of refraction of photosensitive	surfaces of the sbcs-type lies around 2 the fresnel losses	at the fiber-photocathode interface are about 0.	3.8043600758006586
3492. 5 percent and the	f factor for the interstage coupler is 0.	6.647216051415182
3493. it might be anticipated	that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further.	4.847344557167295
3494. the internal losses are due to absorption and the small but	finite losses suffered in the numerous internal reflections due to	deviations from the prescribed cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute	imperfections of the core-jacket interface.	4.249873750267645
3495. these losses depend	on fiber diameter and length absorption coefficient the mean value of	the loss per internal reflection and last but not least on the angular	distribution of the incident light.	3.5512655023982496
3496. explicit expressions	are given in the literature.	8.058607449330358
3497. lacking reliable data for some	of the variables we are relying on experimental data of about 20 percent	internal losses for 14-inch long small diameter	fibers.	3.561224404116875
3498. this relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber	diameters increasing the number of internal reflections.	6.263617405256831
3499. since we are	considering here relatively small diameter fiber plates	their average thickness can be kept below 14 inch and their internal	losses may be assumed as 15 percent.	3.6483706463334955
3500. the packing	efficiency fr of fiber plates did not receive much attention	in the literature probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally	used until rather recently.	5.061985398612144
3501. for circular fibers in a closely	packed hexagonal array the packing efficiency is given by: f where	f and 0.	3.808111655267625
3502. 906 is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the	circumscribed hexagon.	6.782076780290364
3503. for the small diameter fibers now technically	feasible and required for about 100 f resolution f.	4.30331201988542
3504. the cladding	thickness is about 0.	6.5155523300336915
3505. 5|m hence f and f.	5.619635421798327
3506. thus	the efficiency |t couplers is given by- f or approximately	50 percent each.	5.583228874976599
3507. it must be remembered that the fiber plates replace	a glass window and a membrane in addition to an optical	output lens system.	4.521029293865227
3508. the efficiency f of an f lens at the magnification	f is: f neglecting absorption the end losses of the coupling	membrane and the output window f would be 6 percent and 8 percent.	4.2676461498983915
3509. thus the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two	fiber plates is 0.	4.565542220214758
3510. 043 or about	gain of fiber	including the brightness gain f due	to the f area demagnification the overall gain of a fiber coupled double	stage image intensifier is: f it is obvious that the careful	choice of photocathode which maximizes f for a given input e	is very important.	4.577923272564305
3511. the same consideration should govern the choice	of the second-stage phosphor screen for matching with the spectral	sensitivity of the ultimate sensor.	3.615185742824201
3512. we have evaluated the matching integrals for two types	of photocathodes and three types of light input.	5.731225213312049
3513. the input light distributions considered are p-11 and p-20	phosphor emission and the so-called night light	as given by hw babcock and j j johnson.	3.247372700740118
3514. the integrals	are listed in table 14-1 below:	discussion of paraxial device resolution	_resolution limitations	the resolution limitations for a single stage are	given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as	well as the resolution capabilities of the cathodoluminescent viewing	screen.	4.32463747761872
3515. the resolution capabilities of an electrostatic system	depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberrations.	4.037328130830678
3516. it has been stated previously that a minifying electrostatic system yields	a lower resolution than a magnifying system or a system with unity	magnification.	5.446312918283982
3517. furthermore the chromatic aberrations depend	on the chosen high voltage.	4.905686114376957
3518. in general a high anode voltage reduces	chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution.	5.933846283739681
3519. the luminous gain of the discussed tube was calculated from eq	for the 16 possible combinations of s-11 and s-20 photocathodes	and p-11 and p-20 phosphor screens for night light	and p-20 light input.	3.1094247477676515
3520. it corresponds roughly to the light emission of conventional x-ray	.	6.634974012353968
3521. the following efficiencies obtained from jedec	and rca specifications were used: f   the following	table gain values computed according	to eq with f:   the possibility of a space charge	blowup of the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundles has	been pointed out.	3.3475028050271045
3522. it is obvious that such an influence can only be	expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output	levels.	5.5440952812354904
3523. space charge influences will also decrease at increased	voltages.	4.739074362330177
3524. electrostatic systems of the pseudo-symmetric type have	been tested for resolution capabilities by applying electronography.	5.331440467598945
3525. a resolution of 70-80 line-pairs per millimeter appears to be feasible.	4.7320680282566485
3526. the inherent resolution of a cathodoluminescent phosphor	screen decreases with increasingly aggregate thickness	decreases with decreasing porosity	and might be impaired by the	normally used aluminum mirror.	4.456500999950274
3527. thus in general elementary light	optical effects light scatter and electron scatter determine the obtainable	resolution limit.	4.267990921432895
3528. it should be noted that photoluminescence	due to bremsstrahlung generated within the viewing screen by electron	impact appears to be important only if anode voltages in excess	of 30 kv are utilized.	5.791634230066789
3529. it has been stated that settled cathodoluminescent	phosphor screens may have a limiting resolution of 60 f	at high voltage values of approximately 20 kv.	4.147293653921254
3530. for the further discussion	we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of 80 f	and phosphor screen resolution of 60 f.	5.353323767722783
3531. the set of all decisions is called the operating policy or more simply	the policy.	3.6408628380888155
3532. an optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the	best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product.	6.449917899477667
3533. there are thus three components to an optimal design problem:	the specification of the operating variables and the transformation	the specification of the objective function	of which the optimization is desired.	3.507288811837616
3534. for a chemical process	the	first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical	species and the temperature or pressure of the stream.	5.458012926091542
3535. for the	second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling	to be supplied; the way in which the transformation of state depends	on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed	in the next chapter.	3.7196396195221832
3536. the objective function is some measure of	the increase in value of the stream by processing; it is the subject	of chapter 4.	5.53153334789869
3537. the essential characteristic of an optimal policy	when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages	with no feedback was first isolated by bellman.	3.536317746945316
3538. he recognized that	whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an r-stage	process the remaining stages must use an optimal f-stage policy	with respect to the state resulting from the first stage if there	is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process.	5.078708287329782
3539. moreover by	systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and	always using the optimal f-stage policy for the remaining stages	we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all r stages.	3.712882145490841
3540. proceeding	in this way from one to two and from two to three stages we	may gradually build up the policy for any number.	5.2419729127195005
3541. at each step of the	calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied.	4.395967828843386
3542. to see how important this economy is let us suppose that there	are m operating variables at each stage and that the state	is specified by n variables; then the search for the maximum	at any one stage will require a number of operations of order f	.	5.273606336026359
3543. to proceed from	one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated	to allow of interpolation; this number will be of the order	of f.	3.811512230080725
3544. if however we are seeking the optimal r-stage policy	for a given feed state only one search for a maximum is required at	the final step.	5.060029301245277
3545. thus a number of operations of the order of f are	required.	6.798192742705066
3546. if all the operating variables were varied simultaneously	f operations would be required to do the same job and as r	increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations	required by the dynamic program.	5.336618449926797
3547. but even more important than	this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all	operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy namely that	for the given feed state and r stages.	3.889331777450906
3548. in contrast the dynamic	program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for	any smaller number of stages.	5.340616467828763
3549. if the problem is enlarged to require	a complete coverage of feed states f operations are needed by the dynamic	program and f by the direct search.	3.744017353749765
3550. but f is vastly larger	than r.	7.8672625272876715
3551. no optimism is more baseless than that which believes	that the high speed of modern digital computers allows for use of the	crudest of methods in searching out a result.	3.508150602031002
3552. suppose that f and	that the average operation requires only f sec.	6.2073123831719546
3553. then the dynamic	program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would	take	more than three millennia!   the principle of optimality thus	brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of	a multistage decision process.	3.6898662299271066
3554. bellman has annunciated in the	following terms:   an optimal policy has the property that	whatever the initial state and initial decision are the remaining decisions	must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting	from the first decision.	4.737418827790316
3555. this is the principle which	we will invoke in every case to set up a functional equation.	5.00589709583759
3556. it appears	in a form that is admirably suited to the powers of the digital	computer.	6.634074815671737
3557. at the same time every device that can be employed to reduce	the number of variables is of the greatest value and it is one of	the attractive features of dynamic programming that room is left for	ingenuity in using the special features of the problem to this end.	4.19757643772307
3558. the discrete deterministic process	consider the process illustrated	in fig 2.	5.4678654398730995
3559. 1 consisting of r distinct stages.	6.343865058005521
3560. these	will be numbered in the direction opposite to the flow of the process	stream so that stage r is the rth stage from the end.	4.906441628600867
3561. let the state of the stream leaving stage r be denoted by a vector	f and the operating variables of stage r by f.	4.218133031978891
3562. thus	f denotes the state of the feed to the r-stage process and	f the state of the product from the last stage.	6.339392940524954
3563. each stage transforms	the state f of its feed to the state f in a way that depends on	the operating variables f.	4.374253465852932
3564. this transformation	is uniquely determined by f and we therefore speak of the process	as deterministic.	5.903986691785139
3565. in practical situations there will be restrictions	on the admissible operating conditions and we regard the vectors as belonging	to a fixed and bounded set s.	3.79757643947533
3566. the set of vectors f	constitutes the operating policy or more briefly the policy and a	policy is admissible if all the f belong to s.	4.572903566637529
3567. when the policy	has been chosen the state of the product can be obtained from the	state of the feed by repeated application of the transformation;	thus f.	4.487641614239075
3568. the objective function which is to be maximized is some	function usually piecewise continuous of the product state.	5.444555089171463
3569. let this	be denoted by f.	7.077959469389548
3570. an optimal policy is an admissible policy	f which maximizes the objective function p.	5.7967922193675125
3571. the policy may	not be unique but the maximum value of p certainly is and once	the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by	as a function of the feed state f.	3.1991891394178427
3572. let f where the maximization	is over all admissible policies f.	6.8717365568507915
3573. when it is necessary to be specific	we say that the optimal policy is an optimal r-stage policy	with respect to the feed state f.	4.704951063631006
3574. for any choice of admissible	policy f in the first stage the state of the stream leaving	this stage is given by f.	6.267333033527679
3575. this is the feed state of the subsequent	f stages which according to the principle of optimality must use an	optimal f-stage policy with respect to this state.	4.736370968534218
3576. this will result	in a value f of the objective function and when f is chosen correctly	this will give f the maximum of the objective function.	4.970953282779365
3577. thus	f	where the maximization is over all admissible policies f and f	is related to f by can be solved	for f when f is known and clearly f the maximization being	over all admissible f.	3.230113137190338
3578. the set of equations and the	starting equation is of a recursive type well suited to programming	on the digital computer.	4.789574824533269
3579. in finding the optimal r-stage policy	from that of f stages only the function f is needed.	3.871205644076363
3580. when	f has been found it may be transferred into the storage location of	f and the whole calculation repeated.	6.213848043793659
3581. we also see how the results	may be presented although if n the number of state variables	is large any tabulation will become cumbersome.	4.13248449369332
3582. a table or set of tables	may be set out as in table 2.	5.574314755927487
3583. to extract the optimal	r-stage policy with respect to the feed state f we enter section	r of this table at the state f and find immediately	from the last column the maximum value of the objective function.	3.750694413147265
3584. in	the third column is given the optimal policy for stage r and	in the fourth the resulting state of the stream when this policy is used.	5.113373040343012
3585. since by the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an	optimal f-stage policy with respect to f we may enter section f	of the table at this state f and read off the optimal policy for stage	f and the resulting state f.	3.5104097152378917
3586. proceeding in this way up the table	we extract the complete optimal policy and if it is desired we	can check on f by evaluating f at the last stage.	5.612331254254108
3587. it may be	that the objective function depends not only on f but also on f	as when the cost of the operating policy is considered.	4.237263778804849
3588. a moment's	reflection shows that the above algorithm and presentation work equally	well in this case.	5.290676638931941
3589. a form of objective function that we shall often	have occasion to consider is f.	4.245493382805219
3590. here v represents	the	the cost	of operating the stage with conditions .	7.421600990615253
3591. hence p	is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation that	is the net profit.	5.049865114487308
3592. if f denotes the net profit from stage r	and f then the principle of optimality gives f this sequence	of equations may be started with the remark that with no process f there	is no profit ie f.	4.860624245942183
3593. the process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only	statistically is also of interest although for chemical reactor design	it is not as important as the deterministic process.	4.077655600705489
3594. in this case	the stage r operating with conditions f transforms the state	of the stream from f to f but only the probability distribution of	f is known.	4.9280364522617015
3595. this is specified by a distribution function f such	that the probability that f lies in some region d of the stage	space is f.	3.730481299612457
3596. we cannot now speak of maximizing the value	of the objective function since this function is now known only in a	probabilistic sense.	5.37130056203891
3597. we can however maximize its expected value.	6.171035033541095
3598. for	a single stage we may define f where the maximization is by choice	of f.	5.331440467598945
3599. we thus have an optimal policy which maximizes the expected	value of the objective function for a given f.	4.109520269893561
3600. if we consider a process	in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the	next then the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent	stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first.	5.301721389533103
3601. then f the maximization being over all admissible f and the integration	over the whole of stage space.	4.113198308889886
3602. the type of presentation	of results used in the deterministic process may be used here except	that now the fourth column is redundant.	5.401941491556153
3603. the third column gives	the optimal policy but we must wait to see the outcome of stage r	and enter the preceding section of the table at this state.	4.122670809549673
3604. the	discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not	known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter.	5.316108228836616
3605. in many cases it is not	possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages	since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner	through the process.	3.8646032499906924
3606. we replace r the number of the stage	from the end of the process by t a continuous variable which	measures the distance of the point considered from the end of the	process.	6.507183637925514
3607. the word distance is used here in a rather general sense;	it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the	process.	3.888635819755317
3608. if t is the total length of the process its	feed state may be denoted by a vector  and the product	state by  denotes the state at	any point t and  the vector of operating variables	there.	5.077787245684714
3609. a gyro-stabilized platform system using restrained gyros is	well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the	gyro-platform-servo combination.	3.9739748771773598
3610. the restrained gyro-stabilized platform	with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate	equation of motion neglecting transient effects as follows:	f where u is a torque applied about the output axis of the	controlling gyro.	4.267192782413813
3611. the platform angle |f is the angle about	which the gyro is controlling.	3.700289227276755
3612. this is normally termed the gyro input	axis 90` away from the gyro output or |j axis.	6.405090433390513
3613. the gyro angular	momentum is defined by h.	4.280553672808819
3614. thus if the gyro and platform-controller	combination maintains the platform with zero angular	deviation about the |f axis the system can be rotated with an	angular velocity f if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis |j.	4.586314175790934
3615. it is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers	so that a torque can be applied about their output axes.	3.8985152458559025
3616. in the system shown in fig 7-1 the accelerometer output is amplified	and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro output-axis torquer.	5.857381176861341
3617. this torque causes the entire system to rotate about the |f	axis since the response to f.	3.80965061478659
3618. if the polarities are correct the	platform rotates in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output	to zero.	5.935203143115488
3619. as the accelerometer output is decreasing the torque applied	to the gyro output axis decreases and therefore the rate decreases.	3.9469343006190223
3620. finally when the accelerometer output is zero the entire system	remains stationary and the platform is by definition leveled.	5.478164863796743
3621. a mathematical block diagram for the leveling system is shown in	fig 7-2.	4.1188685229375706
3622. the platform is initially off level by the angle |f.	5.315964723648707
3623. the angle generated by the platform servo |f multiplied by g	is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer.	3.390604280653994
3624. f	is the scale factor of the accelerometer.	7.1094963127735795
3625. the voltage f is amplified	by f and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor f.	3.8482181671694886
3626. finally the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented	by f the system as indicated in fig 7-2 is fundamental and simple	because the transient effects of both the platform servo and the	accelerometer have been neglected.	4.780783362835438
3627. with these factors included an upper	limit is placed on the allowable loop gain by stability considerations.	4.577165875761653
3628. in this type of system a high loop gain is desirable because it	provides a fast response time.	6.016850636441393
3629. when the frequency response characteristics	of practical components are considered their effect on	stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop	gain.	3.721670715968107
3630. the time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately	inversely proportional to the servo loop gain.	4.974450989879804
3631. in addition	the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is approximately proportional	to the servo loop gain; ie high loop gain causes the	system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations.	3.5093542695638296
3632. this problem	usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response	time.	5.705664484268808
3633. it must be noticed in fig 7-1 that the accelerometer	responds to any input acceleration.	4.760933968751193
3634. the equation relating input	acceleration to output platform angle is f in practice the preflight	leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe.	4.426289510158595
3635. when the system is arranged for automatic leveling the platform	angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on	the accelerometers.	4.110702197051016
3636. there are many such components of acceleration present	due to the effect of wind gusts engine noise turbulence around	the vehicle etc.	6.055124557939788
3637. one of the greatest problems associated with automatic	leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of high-level	acceleration noise.	4.914265442217263
3638. one solution to the problem is to operate	with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filters.	6.7462186262462245
3639. this technique	causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components	such as the platform tilt.	3.80965061478659
3640. since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering	increases the response time a practical compromise must be reached.	5.498742261129303
3641. one of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the	use of a non-linear amplifier for f.	4.5747471951267435
3642. the amplifier is designed so	that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold	level.	4.762804453309085
3643. below this level the amplifier gain f is proportional	and is of small value in order to provide adequate noise filtering.	4.145688631956537
3644. the	effect is that the platform returns from an off-level position at	a rapid rate until it is nearly level at which point the platform is	controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response	so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process.	4.674683714819685
3645. when	the system is on automatic leveling the gyro drift is canceled by	the output of the leveling system.	3.8435090052941394
3646. the platform actually	tilts off level so that the accelerometer output when amplified	by f will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel	the gyro drift.	4.728665728345589
3647. the amount of platform dip required depends upon the	scale factors of the system.	4.225829768834559
3648. the automatic leveling system described in this section is readily	adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three integrating	gyros.	4.653079438027171
3649. the system requires some switching of flight equipment circuits.	4.496238987641129
3650. however the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled	remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform.	6.003744027043119
3651. this leveling system will hold the platform on-level automatically	as long as the system is actuated.	4.548558242347782
3652. a useful by-product of this	system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift biases	is available from the currents necessary to hold the system in level.	5.404832003498406
3653. the leveling process can be accomplished manually and the results	are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment.	3.524292833124534
3654. the	process consists in turning the platform manually until the outputs	of both accelerometers are zero.	5.331440467598945
3655. the turning is accomplished by applying	voltage to the gyro torquers described above.	3.700289227276755
3656. in brief the human	replaces amplifier f in figs 7-1 and 7-2.	6.116175876346834
3657. manual leveling	requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer outputs.	4.682522813973407
3658. if	high accuracy is required in preflight leveling it is usually necessary	to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs	.	5.253907419850852
3659. with integration the effect of a small	acceleration can be seen after a time.	5.088707106377423
3660. however skill is required on the part of an operator to level a	platform to any degree of accuracy.	6.001070420750537
3661. also it requires more time as	compared to the automatic approach.	4.819820433117885
3662. manual leveling is inconvenient	if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged	period of time.	5.138210239895059
3663. the operator must continually supply the correct	amount of turning current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of	gyro drift is canceled.	3.5802565698877507
3664. this process is especially difficult since gyro	drifting is typically random.	6.071120442168507
3665. platform	heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the accelerometers	parallel to the desired coordinate system of the navigator.	3.730051849018153
3666. in simpler	terms it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction.	5.983323798129954
3667. for purely inertial navigators two techniques are available	to accomplish the platform heading:  use of external or	surveying equipment to establish proper heading.	3.651833973057009
3668. use of the	characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true	heading the choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy	requirements field conditions and the time available to accomplish	the heading.	5.0453576630085575
3669. with the gyro-stabilized platform leveled it can be	headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques.	4.273653874202895
3670. the platform	accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure.	5.504585613369078
3671. before	the accelerometers are mounted on the platform the direction of	their sensitive axis must be accurately determined.	3.8535574800675056
3672. a mirror is mounted	on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is perpendicular	to the sensitive axis of the unit.	5.648117516848775
3673. a precision transit	is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north.	5.477666457963189
3674. this	can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques.	6.220593218685224
3675. with the transit set up a mirror on one of the accelerometers	is sighted and the platform is turned until it is aligned.	4.648953981284281
3676. the	sighting procedure includes the use of a fixture for the transit to	project a beam of light which is darkened by crossed hairs on the accelerometer	mirror.	5.285361505173302
3677. when the platform is aligned the reflected image	of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly superimposed upon the original	crossed hairs.	4.0369328404427955
3678. the images can easily be aligned with a high degree	of accuracy.	5.575801495925293
3679. the platform is turned as required by supplying currents	to the appropriate gyro torquers.	3.6311862882065773
3680. although this technique is	simple and satisfactory one practical difficulty does exist: the direction	of true north must be known for each launch point.	5.130711504560975
3681. however	this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying	team can establish a true north base line with a few days' work.	4.065259433249267
3682. in many installations the inertial platform is raised off the ground	a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight.	5.761934280322487
3683. with this situation it is difficult to sight in on the platform with	surveying equipment.	5.741828996067084
3684. if the platform is not too high off the ground	a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform.	5.870580484379513
3685. obviously the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since	errors are introduced because of motion of the stand.	3.926639768200895
3686. the transit can be replaced by an autocollimator.	6.153442740925014
3687. this instrument	provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations	of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform	on true heading.	4.0383641481366865
3688. the electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified	and supplied to the z-gyro torquer.	4.983105429684655
3689. if the polarity is	correct the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero.	4.160421132535439
3690. information is also available from this autocollimator system to set	the drift bias for the z-axis gyro.	5.441765585786282
3691. if the z gyro	is drifting a current generated by the autocollimator is delivered to	the gyro torquer to cancel the drift.	3.797839986043235
3692. if the drift error is systematic	it can be canceled with a bias circuit which can be arranged and adjusted	to supply the required compensating current.	5.253470802548215
3693. it is possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff which	will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction	and the platform.	3.978635705408885
3694. essentially the stator or reference portion of	the pickoff is established with respect to the true heading direction	and the platform is turned either manually or automatically until the	angular electrical pickoff signal is reduced to zero.	4.553618382687335
3695. gyrocompass alignment is an automatic heading system	which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true	heading.	3.685338251241182
3696. for the case of a purely inertial autonavigator consisting of	three restrained gyros a coordinate system is used where the sensitive	axis of the x accelerometer is parallel to the east-west direction	at the base point and the y accelerometer sensitive	axis is parallel to the north-south direction at the base point.	5.0552939461326645
3697. the	accelerometers are mounted rigidly on the platform.	4.913686410369733
3698. thus if one accelerometer	is properly aligned the other is also.	6.914211968994388
3699. the input axis of the	appropriate gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometers.	4.174712223887416
3700. figure 7-3 shows a platform system with the gyro	vectors arranged as described above.	5.448482501884564
3701. the platform is leveled and properly	headed so that the x-gyro input axis is parallel to the	east-west direction and the y-gyro input axis is parallel to	the north-south direction.	3.418095983944685
3702. the input axis of the x gyro	when pointing in the east-west direction is always perpendicular to	the spin axis of earth.	4.675545057872217
3703. if the platform is not properly headed the	x-gyro input axis will see a component of the earth's rotation.	3.9193755645679262
3704. the sensing of this rotation by the x gyro can be utilized	to direct the platform into proper heading.	4.653079438027171
3705. in fig 7-4	the input axis of the three-axis platform is shown at some point on the	earth.	4.024144434678279
3706. the point is at a latitude |l and the platform is at	an error in heading east.	5.036836457705764
3707. the earth is spinning at an angular velocity	\q equal to one revolution per 24 hr.	3.517347632762636
3708. when the platform is	level |e is a rotation about the z axis of the platform	f.	5.997514610036252
3709. since the earth is rotating and the unleveled gyro-stabilized platform	is fixed with respect to a reference in space an observer on	the earth will see the platform rotating.	3.819228752098766
3710. scotty did not go back to school.	7.339895323784242
3711. his parents	talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist	at the university hospital- mr mckinley was entitled to a	discount for members of his family- and it was decided it would be	best for him to take the remainder of the term off spend a lot of time	in bed and for the rest do pretty much as he chose- provided of	course he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating.	3.8081842822480025
3712. his	teacher and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed	that if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home there was	little danger of his losing a term.	4.8214151259236795
3713. scotty accepted the decision	with indifference and did not enter the arguments.	4.338793688560494
3714. he was	discharged from the hospital after a two-day checkup and he and his	parents had what mr mckinley described as a celebration lunch	at the cafeteria on the campus.	4.79087446476568
3715. rachel wore a smart hat and because	she had been warned recently about smoking puffed at her cigarettes	through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick.	3.4050350161502263
3716. scotty's father	sat sprawled in his chair angular alert as a cricket looking about	at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression	of proprietorship.	4.950258789443734
3717. teachers- men who wore brown suits and	had gray hair and pleasant smiles- came to their table to talk shop	and to be introduced to scotty and rachel.	3.369404295675781
3718. rachel was polite scotty	indifferent.	8.457718703298294
3719. they ate the cafeteria food with its orange sauces	and scotty gazed without interest at his food the teachers the heroic	baronial windows and the bright ranks of college banners.	3.4866136337412064
3720. his father	tried to make the food a topic.	8.041998240435458
3721. the blueberry pie is good	scotty.	4.747750369463677
3722. he looked at his son his face worried.	6.672211275991213
3723. scotty murmured no thanks so softly his father had to	bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him.	3.5189173996816376
3724. scotty regarded the ear and the grizzled hair around it with a moment	of interest.	5.928297225131144
3725. he said more loudly i'm full old pop.	5.745844425903409
3726. he	had eaten almost nothing on the crested three-sectioned plate and	had drunk about half the milk in its paper container.	5.059595323176457
3727. he's	all right craig rachel said.	5.619635421798327
3728. i can fix him something later	in the afternoon when we get home.	6.677228029679281
3729. since his seizure scotty	had had little appetite; yet his changed appearance surprisingly	was one of plumpness.	4.13660814539201
3730. his face was fuller; his lips and the usually	sharp lines of his jaw had become swollen-looking.	5.571863625702179
3731. he breathed now	with his mouth open showing a whitely curving section of lower teeth;	he kept his eyes with their puffed blurred lids always lowered	though not apparently focusing.	3.379445892865623
3732. even his neck seemed thicker and	therefore shorter.	7.918539841837454
3733. his hands which had been as quick as a pair of fluttering	birds were now neither active nor really relaxed.	4.267814027658235
3734. they lay	on his lap palms up stiffly motionless the tapered fingers a little	thick at the joints.	5.35425038072843
3735. altogether he had since the seizure the appearance	of a boy who overindulged in food and took no exercise.	3.802284975748604
3736. he looked	lazy spoiled a little querulous.	7.5139871259533155
3737. rachel had little to say.	5.619635421798327
3738. she greeted her husband's colleagues with smiling politeness offering	nothing.	6.713816465488134
3739. mr mckinley for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity	was completely alert to his son eyes always on the still	face jumping to anticipate scotty's desires.	3.790769522950828
3740. it was a strained silent	lunch.	10.347435731693974
3741. rachel said i'd better get him to bed.	4.6724501027054846
3742. the doctors had suggested scotty remain most of every afternoon	in bed until he was stronger.	4.827484701178731
3743. since mr mckinley had to	give a lecture rachel and scotty drove home alone in the plymouth.	4.050791855660775
3744. they did not speak much.	10.965062195191853
3745. scotty gazed out at ugly gray slums and	said softly look at those stupid kids.	3.8849121559715263
3746. it was a negro section	of peeling row houses store-front churches and ragged children.	6.365848408993782
3747. rachel	had to bend toward scotty and ask him to repeat.	4.317068102383446
3748. and then: there are lots of kids around here.	6.810966747105137
3749. scotty looked at the children his mouth slightly opened his eyes	dull.	4.346701144689689
3750. he felt tired and full and calm.	7.641910821491423
3751. the	days seemed short perhaps because his routine was each day almost	the same.	4.0683852436856025
3752. he rose late and went down in his bathrobe and slippers to	have breakfast either alone or with rachel.	5.21580052589399
3753. virginia treated him with	attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food: biscuits	cookies candies- the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen.	4.0150626730713865
3754. she would hover over him and looking like her brother anxiously	watch the progress of scotty's fork or spoon.	5.84995715718661
3755. you don't	eat enough honey.	8.09303208031044
3756. try to get that down.	11.08121704754796
3757. rachel observing	would say he has to rediscover his own capacity.	4.819927667748143
3758. virginia and rachel talked to each other quietly	now as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war	atmosphere.	5.244604029124691
3759. both watched scotty constantly rachel without seeming	to virginia openly her eyes filled with concern.	4.2054586099850315
3760. he did not resent their supervision or virginia's sometimes tiring	sympathy.	7.402553349809283
3761. he ate what he felt like slept as much or as little as	he pleased and moved about the draughty rooms of the house when he	was not in bed with slow dubious steps like an elderly tourist in a	cathedral.	3.4456545200063076
3762. he was able now to sit for hours	in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without	moving.	6.2741568600859265
3763. his hands lay loosely yet stiffly- they were like wax hands:	almost lifelike not quite- folded in his lap; his mouth hung	slightly open.	3.5362572906591327
3764. when he was asked a question or addressed in such a way	that some response was inescapable he would answer; if as often	happened he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly he would	repeat his words in the same way without emphasis or impatience only	a little louder.	5.377214413936325
3765. he had not mentioned kate.	7.52007473957541
3766. he had not even	thought about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his	slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly almost accidentally encounter	her.	5.373016265864285
3767. at these times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest but	it was an objective pain in no way different from others in intensity	and not different in kind; it was like the bandaged wound on the back	of his head which occasionally throbbed; it was merely another part	of his weakness.	3.3338522218694657
3768. he was calm drugged and lazy.	8.524995147246532
3769. rachel mentioned kate.	6.939425769494729
3770. she said i notice the girl from	across the street hasn't bothered to phone or visit.	5.903136789546736
3771. scotty	said that's all right.	6.162967476035402
3772. he thought	about it briefly then deliberately turned the talk to something else.	5.752586250134144
3773. once sitting at the front window in his parents' room he	saw kate come out of her house.	4.344274376987999
3774. they were	far off and looked tiny.	7.7782111142395784
3775. the heavy branches in his front yard would hide	and then reveal them.	3.7001608864762963
3776. they turned at the bottom of kate's steps	and moved off in the direction of the park.	6.684223908466239
3777. he thought he saw- it	awakened and for a moment interested him- that elizabeth held a	leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash.	4.321869686073288
3778. then they disappeared and scotty got up and went into his own	room and got into bed.	5.996101242976696
3779. by the time he was under the covers he had forgotten	about seeing kate.	5.619338629137222
3780. the doctor since scotty was no longer	allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him came often	and informally to the house.	4.603713554915759
3781. he would sit slim-waisted and spare	on the edge of scotty's bed his legs crossed so elaborately that the	crossed foot could tap the floor.	3.883982877626398
3782. scotty did not mind the doctor's	unsmiling teasing as he used to.	5.875819110669642
3783. husky young man he	said with mock distaste.	4.913686410369733
3784. i imagine you're always battling in school.	7.419762506052198
3785. i don't go to school any more.	5.907356466889155
3786. pardon?	13.921774766768346
3787. 	the doctor had to bend close to hear; his delicate hand as	veined as a moth's wing rested absently on scotty's chest.	3.5033994744337345
3788. scotty	said the same words more loudly.	7.163184125958424
3789. well we're taking a	little vacation that's all.	5.796618518052249
3790. he turned unsmilingly to rachel.	8.936506657120397
3791. i	think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little.	5.647811077636238
3792. he could now but the weakness is very definite; it would exhaust	him further and unnecessarily.	5.98721146564611
3793. his stethoscope	was on the table by scotty's bed and he picked it up and wagged	it at scotty.	4.070532691045113
3794. he said fussily just keep the cap on those	strong emotions.	7.073454544422407
3795. the stethoscope glinted silver in the darkening room.	4.1174608023645085
3796. i'll drop by again in a few days.	7.5709808836944585
3797. rachel stayed	on after the doctor had gone.	4.913686410369733
3798. she smoothed the covers on scotty's	bed and picked things up from the floor.	6.343951866222525
3799. she did not touch him.	6.773018716886577
3800. he did not speak.	12.489052350037706
3801. he had no desire to.	8.267445906977285
3802. she said do you think you'll miss school?	8.816570468645741
3803.    he	had noticed how formal and irritably exact rachel had grown.	4.355040023770888
3804. he felt her irritability did not concern him yet he knew	he would not care even if it did.	5.61395679382223
3805. we've	had any number of calls about you.	5.452481737715539
3806. you could win a popularity contest	at that school without any trouble.	6.8497454359436905
3807. she wants to pay you a visit.	5.4558319364004175
3808. she says the children miss you.	8.70163368996951
3809. apparently	you were the light of their lives.	5.930357578670578
3810. rachel came close to the bed bent as if she would kiss him	then moved away.	5.97578093272429
3811. that doctor annoys me.	7.512203395885849
3812. she	seemed to speak to herself.	8.599074372633357
3813. do you suppose his self-consciousness	is characteristic of the new negro professionals or merely of doctors	in general?	5.0632066789664005
3814.    she turned to him again.	9.064876134142267
3815. well mrs	charles- sally- has phoned too.	6.260179202319753
3816. rachel's	tone was dry.	9.52328749892442
3817. she didn't really say- she glanced	away at the floor then swooped gracefully and picked up one of scotty's	slippers.	3.940547126844873
3818. i mean do you feel like seeing kate?	7.526763979729287
3819. 	scotty said i don't know.	5.619635421798327
3820. he did not.	13.177478284911475
3821. there	was the slight pain but it was no different from the throbbing in	his head.	5.141720607882514
3822. well there's time in any case.	8.591126747194702
3823. we'll wait	till you're stronger and then talk about it.	4.477601198394805
3824. she put the slipper	neatly	by its mate at the foot of the bed.	6.834139184510185
3825. this time rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead.	5.240011995595883
3826. his father was a constant visitor.	8.286892662034013
3827. scotty	would hear the front door in the evening and then his father's deep	slow voice; it floated up the stairs.	3.66632750338918
3828. how's scotty?	11.155741451300253
3829. 	and rachel's or virginia's reply: better.	5.219666477665999
3830. he's	getting plenty of rest.	8.457718703298294
3831. is his appetite improved?	8.407539535987503
3832. 	or: does he get exercise?	7.712079578137997
3833.    the exchange was almost	invariable and scotty in his bed could hear every word of it.	3.5177069743400518
3834. it required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical	about his father.	6.038008478364605
3835. his father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously	at the foot of the bed and look at his son.	4.2416775982569455
3836. after a pause	during which he studied scotty's face as if scotty were not there	and could not study him too mr mckinley would ask the same	questions he had asked downstairs.	4.8526264063790245
3837. scotty would reply softly and	his father apologetically would ask him to repeat.	4.0683852436856025
3838. i'm	eating more he would say.	7.712079578137997
3839. or: i walk around the house a	lot.	5.176723087847041
3840. perhaps you should get out a little.	8.418205107234906
3841. i'm	not supposed to yet.	6.162967476035402
3842. he did not mind	the useless kindly questions.	8.953251763404689
3843. he looked at the lined face with vague	interest; he felt he was noting it as if it were something he might	think about when he grew stronger.	3.775657650651013
3844. mr mckinley examined	everything with critical care seeking something material to blame for	his son's illness.	5.642922835614992
3845. have you got enough blankets?	7.074686404178957
3846.  and	another time without accusation: you never wore that scarf	i bought you.	5.739974350684024
3847. where their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves thrusting themselves	upward in angry motion papa-san sat glacier-like his smooth solidity	his very immobility defying all the turmoil about him.	3.4940876871974154
3848. our	objective the colonel had said that day of the briefing is papa-san.	6.127778230234542
3849. there the objective sat brooding over all.	6.477946292890498
3850. gouge burn	blast insult it as they would could anyone really take papa-san?	5.780694126664545
3851. 	between the ponderous hulk and himself in the valley over which	papa-san reigned men had hidden high explosives booby traps and	mines.	3.8229246965552233
3852. the raped valley was a pregnant womb awaiting abortion.	5.4678654398730995
3853. on	the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed	wire.	5.563287394361765
3854. at the slope's base coils of concertina stretched out of eye	range like a wild tangle of children's hoops stopped simultaneously	weirdly poised as if awaiting the magic of the child's touch to	start them all rolling again.	4.601538116277289
3855. closer still regular barricades of barbed	wire hung on timber supports.	4.317068102383446
3856. was it all vain labor?	9.669656091662496
3857.  who would	clean up the mess when the war was over?	5.531900036671543
3858.  smiling at his quixotic	thoughts warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before	sitting down.	5.284018547978732
3859. tonight a group of men tomorrow night he himself	would go out there somewhere and wait.	4.616015177148398
3860. if he were to go with white	he would be out there two days not just listening in the dark at some	point between here and papa-san but moving ever deeper into enemy	land- behind papa-san itself.	5.28323774188767
3861. was this what he had expected?	6.0358298714072465
3862.  he	hadn't realized that there would be so much time to think so many	lulls.	6.734839345416884
3863. somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told that combat	was an intermittent activity.	4.416442489721769
3864. now he knew that the moment illuminated	by the vision on the train would have to be approached.	7.54011370299947
3865. it could	take place tomorrow night or it might occur months from now.	4.492216360467276
3866. there	was just too much time.	8.71041785937276
3867. white's suggestion	flattered but he did not like the identity.	5.619034896842342
3868. he did not spill over with	hatred for the enemy.	7.810498811165058
3869. he hadn't even seen him yet h   pressing	his cigarette out in the earth warren walked to the slit and	scanned the jagged hills.	4.177396406983742
3870. he saw no life but still stood there for	a time peering at the unlovely hills his gaze continually returning to	papa-san.	5.059947511179217
3871. he had come here in order to test himself.	6.904599379425945
3872. while most of	his beliefs were still unsettled he knew that he did not believe in	killing.	7.2960746008637525
3873. he had come because he could not live out	his life feeling that he had been a coward.	5.873899699885572
3874. there were ten men	on the patrol which sergeant prevot led out that next night.	6.1151764979809435
3875. the	beaming rok was carrying a thirty-caliber machine gun; another	man lugged the tripod and a box of ammunition.	3.685338251241182
3876. warren and white each	carried in addition to their own weapons and ammo a box of ammo for	the rok's machine gun.	5.723385371961197
3877. others carried extra clips for the	browning automatic rifle which was in the hands of a little mexican	named martinez.	5.122623883202317
3878. prevot had briefed the two new men that afternoon.	6.144814417540349
3879. we just sit quiet and wait prevot had said.	4.921535203291604
3880. be sure the	man nearest you is awake.	8.261779726753154
3881. if joe doesn't show up we'll all be	back here at 0600 hours.	4.466859378562011
3882. otherwise we hold a reception.	8.955402047606315
3883. then we pull	out under our mortar and artillery cover but nobody pulls out until	i say so.	4.214325004482689
3884. remember what i said about going out to get anybody left	behind?	6.135004585700394
3885.  that still holds.	8.701286958147561
3886. we bring back all dead and wounded.	7.543900632520252
3887. at 2130 hours they had passed through the barbed wire at the	point of departure.	4.284140470837066
3888. then began the journey through their own mine fields.	6.721980972829298
3889. ours were kinder than theirs some said.	4.913686410369733
3890. they set bouncing	betties to jump and explode at testicle level while we more mercifully	had them go off at the head.	5.031164312904003
3891. the crude	wooden boxes of the enemy our nicely turned gray metal disks.	3.864115027443709
3892. but	theirs defied the detectors.	8.457718703298294
3893. a foot misplaced a leg missing.	5.147939388521343
3894. all sizes: big ones some wired to set off a whole field	little ones hand grenade size.	5.635317352066291
3895. booby traps to fill the head with	chunks of metal.	5.0977081470224235
3896. warren tried to shake off the jumble of his fears by	looking at the sky.	5.331440467598945
3897. prevot had said that the searchlights	would be bounced off the clouds at 2230 hours which gives us time	to get settled in position.	3.811586968866655
3898. because they were new men and	to be sure that they didn't get lost prevot had placed warren	and white in the center of the patrol as it filed out.	6.041568617993557
3899. his eyes now	fixed on white's solid figure warren could hear behind him the tread	of another.	4.010505895239032
3900. he could also hear the stream which he had seen from	his position.	7.027535367209296
3901. they were going to follow it for part of their journey.	6.044498311434096
3902. it's safe prevot had said and it provides cover for our	noise.	5.935790009985215
3903. soon they were picking their way along the edge of	the stream which glowed in the night.	4.3225995559038815
3904. on their right rose the embankment	covered with brush and trees.	7.124750008763227
3905. if a branch extended out too far	each man held it back for the next and if they met a low overhang each	warned the other.	4.102487914836145
3906. thus stealthily they advanced upstream; then	they turned to the right climbed the embankment and walked into the	valley again.	6.166764337413559
3907. there was no cover here only grass sighing against	pant-legs.	5.752946426906755
3908. and with each sigh like a whip in the hand of an expert	the grass stripped something from warren.	5.427636076784884
3909. the gentle whir of each footstep	left him more naked than before until he felt his unprotected	flesh tremble chilled by each new sound.	3.287075650498861
3910. the shapes of the men ahead	of him lacked solidity as if the whip had stripped them of their very	flesh.	5.33809490606545
3911. the dark forms moved like mourners on some nocturnal pilgrimage	their dirge unsung for want of vocal chords.	3.508277725433806
3912. the warped broken	trees in the valley assumed wraith-like shapes.	5.610856282075207
3913. clumps of brush that	they passed were so many enchained demons straining	in anger to tear and gnaw on his bones.	3.5853166747464886
3914. looming over all papa-san	leered down at him threatening a hundred hidden malevolencies.	5.583228874976599
3915. off in	the distance a searchlight flashed on its beam slashing the sky.	4.345922870688738
3916. the	sharp ray was absorbed by a cloud then reflected to the earth in a	softer diffused radiance.	5.292804964994347
3917. somewhere over there another patrol had need	of light.	4.942704503411988
3918. warren thought of all the men out that night who like	himself had left their protective ridge and- fear working at their	guts- picked their way into the area beyond.	5.093549020604985
3919. from the east to the west	coast of the korean peninsula was a strip of land in which fear-filled	men were at that same moment furtively crawling through the night	sitting in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound or shouting	amidst confused rifle flashes and muzzle blasts.	3.37234526013053
3920. white's arm went	up and warren raised his own.	6.412214371980113
3921. prevot	came up take that spot over there he whispered pointing to	a small clump of blackness.	3.8101576301595865
3922. give me your machine gun ammo.	7.992377018616751
3923. warren	handed him the metal box and prevot quietly disappeared down the	line.	4.182602481535312
3924. lying in the grass behind the brush clump warren looked	about.	6.115063227082583
3925. the others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and	the brush.	4.365565950507686
3926. over his shoulder he could see prevot with the machine gun	crew.	6.724160605909274
3927. even at this short distance they were only vague shapes setting	up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the	heads of the rest of the patrol.	4.0043939761120795
3928. warren eased his rifle's	safety off and gently slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from	one of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part of his body with	an x.	4.7550740751861165
3929. this he placed within quick reach.	5.959310530267032
3930. the walk and his fears	had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch	of the night air.	4.5635753977982
3931. although the armored vest fitted the upper part	of his body snugly he felt no security.	4.334591133543185
3932. figures seemed to crouch in	the surrounding dark; in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed	to advance and retreat even as he watched.	5.196934974503978
3933. certain this menace was	only imaginary he yet stared in fascinated horror his hand sticky against	the stock of his weapon.	3.6924774972413164
3934. he was aware of insistent inner beatings	as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body.	5.605390629947532
3935. above the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight pointed at the clouds	diluting the valley's dark to a pallid light.	3.8086153066262414
3936. then the figures	which held his attention became a group of shattered trees standing	like the grotesques of a medieval damnation scene.	5.926002022418023
3937. even so he could	not ease the tension of his body; the rough surface of the earth itself	seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax.	4.15476105170896
3938. sensing the	unseen presence of the other men in the patrol he felt mutely united	to these nine near-strangers sharing this pinpoint of being with him.	5.362809391524326
3939. he sensed something precious in the perilous moment something akin	to the knowledge gained on his bicycle trip through the french countryside	a knowledge imprisoned in speechlessness.	3.4334256829672896
3940. in france	he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown	up to the sky and always as he wandered he felt a stranger to their	exultation.	5.545322301200748
3941. they were poems in a strange language of which he could	barely touch a meaning- enough to make his being ache with the desire	for the fullness he sensed there.	3.8855496911562386
3942. brittany that stone-gray mystery	through which he traveled for thirty days sleeping in the barns of	farmers or alongside roads had worked some subtle change in him he	knew and it was in brittany that he had met pierre.	5.11485316614396
3943. pierre	had no hands; they had been severed at the wrists.	4.927359746331963
3944. with leather cups	fitted in his handlebars he steered his bicycle.	6.629497035952281
3945. he and warren had	traveled together for four days.	5.291042865034725
3946. they visited the shipyards at brest	and pierre had to sign the register vouching for the integrity of	the visiting foreigner.	5.099699971665426
3947. he took the pen in his stumps and began to	write.	4.937070063031525
3948. wait! wait! cried the guard who ran from the	hut to shout to other men standing about outside.	5.161755022314025
3949. they crowded the small	room and peered over one another's shoulders to watch the handless	man write his name in the book.	3.9380293005151414
3950. c'est merveilleux.	11.155741451300253
3951. and then the questions came eager interested questions and many compliments	on his having overcome his infirmity.	4.451882138718841
3952. doesn't it	ever bother you warren had asked to have people always asking	you about your hands?	5.2288514545018705
3953.    oh the french are a very curious	people pierre had laughed.	4.729420976019694
3954. they are also honest seekers	after truth.	9.940426825400204
3955. now the english are painfully silent about my missing	hands.	5.4200677674141735
3956. they refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there.	7.359450858397481
3957. the	americans like yourself take the fact for granted try to be helpful	but don't ask questions.	3.8101576301595865
3958. i'm used to all three but i think	the french have the healthiest attitude.	5.448482501884564
3959. that was the day	that pierre had told warren about the abbey of solesmes.	5.053945259223976
3960. you	are looking tired and there you can rest.	6.412214371980113
3961. it will be good for you.	7.484743433059677
3962. i think too he said his dark eyes mischievous that you will	find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals about which you	have spoken.	5.559859216482015
3963. within two weeks warren was ringing the bell	at the abbey gate.	4.726849079898836
3964. the monk who opened the door immediately calmed his	worries about his reception: i speak english the old man	said but i do not hear it very well.	4.842543562760878
3965. he smiled and stuck a large	finger with white hairs sprouting on it into his ear as though that	might help.	3.6606271074526586
3966. smiling at warren's protestations the old monk took	his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor.	5.116989418019865
3967. will	you please wait in here.	5.619635421798327
3968. mickie sat over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next	to the funeral parlor on pennsylvania avenue.	5.281028613407182
3969. al's little cafe	was small dark narrow and filled with the mingled scent of beer	tobacco smoke and italian cooking.	3.727025930335636
3970. hanging over the bar was an oil	painting of a nude al had accepted from a student at the corcoran	gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke.	4.77067876590806
3971. the nude was small	and black-haired and elfin and was called eloise.	3.780080438305787
3972. this	was one place where moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without	anyone noticing him or at least coming up and hanging around and	wanting to know all the low-down.	4.870607281137391
3973. the other patrons were taxi drivers	and art students and small shopkeepers.	4.4457763779332415
3974. the reporters had not yet	discovered that this was his hideaway.	5.971001435864881
3975. his friend jane was with	him.	5.9486541196568785
3976. she was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even	if he did weigh too much and didn't own the mint.	5.1146379147287
3977. she was the widow	of a writer who had died in an airplane crash and mickie had found	her a job as head of the historical section of the treasury.	4.225569585528707
3978. this	meant sorting out press clippings and the like.	6.412214371980113
3979. jane sat receptive	and interested.	6.162967476035402
3980. mickie had a pleasant glow as he said you see	both of them i mean the president and jeff lawrence are romantics.	5.273800613196508
3981. a romantic is one who thinks the world is divinely inspired and	all he has to do is find the right key and then divine justice and	altruism will appear.	3.9365354945557245
3982. it's like focusing a camera; the distant ship	isn't there until you get the focus.	5.494214588120156
3983. you know what i'm talking	about.	7.74717680951086
3984. i'm sure all girls feel this way about men until they live	with them.	5.448482501884564
3985. but when it comes to war the colonel knows what	it is and jeff doesn't.	4.910606682124761
3986. mr christiansen knows that a soldier	will get the distinguished service medal for conduct that would land	him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian.	4.719860183599381
3987. he had	a mean unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit and someone invented the	name trig for him.	3.834693659301933
3988. that's to say he was trigger happy.	7.75171196261537
3989. he'd	shoot at anything if it was the rear end of a horse or his own sentry.	5.079374542332333
3990. he was a wiry inscrutable silent country boy from the red clay of	rural alabama and he spoke with the broad drawl that others normally	make fun of.	5.202365794193121
3991. but not in front of trig.	8.197830107413687
3992. i heard of some that tried	it back in the states and he'd knock them clear across the room.	6.522153682937777
3993. there'd been a pretty bad incident back at the marine base.	4.758053399109623
3994. a new	york kid a refugee from one of the harlem gangs made fun of trig's	accent and drew a knife.	5.701881008615413
3995. before the fight was over the harlem	boy had a concussion and trig was cut up badly.	4.364378365579374
3996. they caught trig	stealing liquor from the officers' mess and he got a couple of girls	in trouble.	6.140427747496597
3997. the fear of punishment just didn't bother him.	4.545872434804499
3998. it was left out of him at birth.	7.251726844419799
3999. this is why he made such	a magnificent soldier.	5.873960732548987
4000. he wasn't troubled with the ordinary rank-and-file	fear that overcomes and paralyzes and sends individual soldiers	and whole companies under fire running in panic.	4.847295323228176
4001. it just didn't	occur to trig that anything serious would happen to him.	4.491256283974483
4002. do you get	the picture of the kind of fellow he was?	8.765331678668204
4003.    jane nodded	with a pleasant smile.	5.619635421798327
4004. there was a sniper's nest	in a mountain cave and it was picking off our men with devilish accuracy.	6.584241761355955
4005. the colonel ordered that it be wiped out and i suggested	'you ask for volunteers and promise each man on the patrol a quart	of whisky ten dollars and a week-end pass to davao'.	3.233494169997345
4006. trig was	one of the five volunteers.	7.979821661938498
4007. the patrol snaked around in back of the cave	approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild howls.	3.690264819428716
4008. you could hear them from our outpost.	8.73504199835289
4009. there was a lot of shooting.	9.604988962218469
4010. we knew the enemy was subdued because a flare was fired as the signal.	5.708975906075457
4011. two of our men were killed a third was wounded.	5.13957163575988
4012. trig and a very black colored boy from detroit had killed or put	out of action ten guerrillas by grenades and hand-to-hand fighting.	4.852722920849208
4013. when	we got there trig and the negro were quarreling over possession	of a gold crucifix around the neck of a wounded filipino.	3.7568091351373205
4014. the colored	boy had it and trig lunged at him with a knife and said 'give	that to me you black bastard.	4.738246520332901
4015. we don't 'low nigras to walk on	the same sidewalk with white men where i come from'.	3.982422641084651
4016. the	negro got a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound.	5.583228874976599
4017. what	did the colonel do about the men?	5.169481037986765
4018.  jane asked in her placid	interested way.	7.163184125958424
4019. he recommended both of	them for the dsm and the detroit fellow for the purple heart	too for a combat-inflicted wound.	3.6606271074526586
4020. so you see mr christiansen	knows what it's all about.	7.792488551746742
4021. when he was in	the war he was in law or supplies or something like that and an	old buddy of his told me he would come down on sundays to the pentagon	and read the citations for medals- just like the one we sent in for	trig- and go away with a real glow.	3.4191586484940935
4022. these were heroes nine feet	tall to him.	7.56727425279836
4023. jefferson lawrence was alone at the small perfectly	appointed table by the window looking out over the river.	3.784994233174727
4024. he	had dinner and sat there over his coffee watching the winding pattern	of traffic as it crossed the bridge and spread out like a serpent with	two heads.	4.618369105116258
4025. open beside him was mrs dalloway.	5.219666477665999
4026. he thought how	this dainty fragile older woman threading her way through the streets	of westminster on a day in june enjoying the flowers in the shops	the greetings from old friends but never really drawing a deep passionate	breath was so like himself.	4.384478171218462
4027. he and mrs dalloway too	had never permitted themselves the luxury of joys that dug into the	bone marrow of the spirit.	4.072391844009047
4028. he had not because he was both poor	and ambitious.	8.740750670515972
4029. poverty imposes a kind of chastity on the ambitious.	5.337807464651529
4030. they cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of cars	along a dark country lane.	5.604607540363626
4031. no they must look the other way and climb	one more painful step up the ladder.	4.2153416279253655
4032. he made the decision with his	eyes open or so he thought.	6.580610236058894
4033. at any cost he must leave the dreary pennsylvania	mining town where his father was a pharmacist.	4.258411402049683
4034. and so he	had so he had.	9.028321158356036
4035. at state college he had no time to walk among the	violets on the water's edge.	4.515855196473178
4036. from his room he could look out in springtime	and see the couples hand in hand walking slowly deliciously	across the campus and he could smell the sweet vernal winds.	5.329215901320826
4037. he was not unmoved.	9.311447432906151
4038. he had to teach himself patiently that	these traps were not for him.	7.309627226812731
4039. he must mentally pull the blinds and	close the window so that all that existed was in the books before him.	4.319053182034527
4040. at law school the same.	9.378567327430734
4041. more of this stamping down of human emotion	as a young lawyer in new york.	4.326974100896273
4042. by the time he was prosperous enough-	his goals were high- he was bald and afraid of women.	6.524693018369412
4043. the only	one who would have him was his cripple the strange unhappy woman	who became his wife.	3.573090910349951
4044. perhaps it was right; perhaps it was just.	7.673564791124762
4045. he	had dared to defy nature to turn his back to the lorelei and he was	punished.	4.317972948735488
4046. like mrs dalloway with her regrets about peter walsh	he had his moments of melancholy over a youth too well spent.	5.224710605180397
4047. if	he had had a son he would tell him gather ye rosebuds while ye	may h this same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying.	3.606494546029479
4048. but then his son could afford it.	8.083216180239674
4049. lawrence was waiting for bill	boxell.	5.703634548019635
4050. the vice president had called and asked if he could see	the secretary at his home.	5.295560170460534
4051. he said the matter was urgent.	7.650695544894103
4052. the secretary	was uneasy about the visit.	6.154713990487742
4053. he did not like boxell.	7.94572370133355
4054. he suspected	something underhanded and furtive about him.	7.042834174643505
4055. lawrence could not	put his finger on it precisely and this worried him.	4.200055338803246
4056. when you disliked	or distrusted a man you should have a reason.	7.962408340821618
4057. human nature was	not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell.	4.277883388412053
4058. lawrence stared	a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic hoping that a clue to his	dislike of the vice president would appear.	5.025022112338406
4059. therefore	he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort	to understand and sympathize with his point of view.	3.915141552728965
4060. a half	hour later the vice president arrived.	7.2741757200015025
4061. he looked very carefully at	every piece of furnishing as though hoping to store this information	carefully in his mind.	3.71232811436732
4062. he observed the florentine vase in the hall	the renoir painting in the library as well as the long shelves of well-bound	volumes; the pattern of the oriental rug the delicate cut-glass	chandelier.	5.292628013954378
4063. he said to the secretary i understand	you came from a little pennsylvania town near wilkes-barre.	4.570718265959842
4064. how did	you find out about this?	8.810086659078799
4065.  he waved his arm around at the furnishings.	5.102107714027266
4066. it was not a discourteous question lawrence decided.	9.052566336653133
4067. this young man had so little time to learn he had to be curious;	he had to find out.	4.5472398532109635
4068. the secretary did not tell him at what cost at	what loneliness he learned these things.	5.380705292168584
4069. he merely said any good	decorator these days can make you a tasteful home.	4.120051336182742
4070. the vice	president said if you hear of any names that would fix me cheap	in return for advertising they decorated the vice president's	home let me know.	4.398528065430878
4071. i can do business with that kind.	6.523077747038773
4072. again	lawrence thought a little sadly these were the fees of poverty and	ambition.	5.778069512947268
4073. boxell did not have the chance to grow up graciously.	5.996856836211019
4074. he	had to acquire everything he was going to get in four years.	6.642977241842973
4075. they	had brandy in the library.	5.619635421798327
4076. boxell looked at lawrence with a searching	glance the kind that a prosecuting attorney would give a man on trial.	5.024807442187901
4077. what are your weaknesses?	8.404127871804274
4078.  where will you break?	10.55931546888576
4079.  how best to	destroy your peace?	6.802820571833633
4080.    the vice president said with a slight	bluster there isn't anyone who loves the president more than	i do.	5.029840039757127
4081. old chris is my ideal.	6.45630889895198
4082. at the same time you have to face facts	and realize that a man who's been in the marine corps all his	life doesn't understand much about politics.	6.399455147270725
4083. what does a monk know	about sex?	6.7596685064186
4084.    lawrence listened with the practiced deceptive	calm of the lawyer but his face was in the shadow.	6.027104077626955
4085. so	we have to protect the old man for his own good.	5.051802957720943
4086. you see what i mean.	9.812993507461487
4087. congress is full of politicians and if you want to get along with	them you have to be politic.	5.722974519721649
4088. this is why i say we just can't go ahead	and disarm the germans and pull down our own defenses.	5.545081560985257
4089. let me tell	you what happened to me today.	6.283550090192842
4090. a fellow came up to me a senator	i don't have to tell you his name and he told me 'i love the	president like a brother but god damn it he's crucifying me.	5.260419577368937
4091. i've	got a quarter of a million germans in my state and those krautheads	tune in on father werther every night and if he tells them to	go out and piss in the public square that's what they do.	3.4458016528830244
4092. he's	telling them now to write letters to their congressmen opposing the disarmament	of germany'.	5.448482501884564
4093. and another one comes to me and he says 'look	here there's a mill in my state employs five thousand people	making uniforms for the navy.	3.5662086627719765
4094. the bishop looked at him coldly and said take it or leave it!	literally there was nothing else to do.	4.69378121348214
4095. he was caught in	a machine.	6.8185940733068335
4096. but sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite	calmly: let's go and see what it's like.	5.538842775865009
4097. annisberg	was about seventy-five miles west of birmingham near the georgia	border and on the tallahoosa river a small and dirty stream.	3.9895447897050325
4098. the	city was a center of manufacture especially in textiles and also	because of the beauty of some of its surroundings a residence for many	owners of the great industries in north alabama.	5.115739676270911
4099. but it had as was	usual in southern cities of this sort a black bottom a low region	near the river where the negroes lived- servants and laborers huddled	together in a region with no sewage save the river where streets	and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime.	3.352663453269524
4100. wilson came by train from birmingham and looked the city	over; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief	stores were.	5.187749459526215
4101. beyond were industries and factories.	6.080524321960787
4102. then they went down	to black bottom.	8.923335654582957
4103. in the midst of this crowded region was the allen	african methodist episcopal church.	4.887196862168264
4104. it was an old and dirty	wooden structure sadly in need of repair.	7.6619579660868675
4105. but it was a landmark.	11.242198917555049
4106. it	had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town black and white	knew of it.	5.138210239895059
4107. it had just suffered a calamity the final crisis in a	long series of calamities.	4.520964289531908
4108. for the old preacher who had been there twenty-five	years was dead and the city mourned him.	7.362615027123671
4109. he was a	loud-voiced man once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength	and ability.	4.747669924901089
4110. he was stern and overbearing with his flock but obsequious	and conciliatory with the whites especially the rich who partly	supported the church.	5.154520032077086
4111. the deacon board headed by a black man	named carlson had practically taken over as the pastor grew old and	had its way with the support of the amen corner.	3.5716912138501633
4112. the characteristic	thing about this church was its amen corner and the weekly religious	orgy.	5.105439716250608
4113. a knot of old worshippers chiefly women listened weekly to a	sermon.	4.144256012964684
4114. it began invariably in low tones almost conversational and	then gradually worked up to high shrill appeals to god and man.	5.435959498614419
4115. and	then the amen corner took hold re-enacting a form of group participation	in worship that stemmed from years before the greek chorus spreading	down through the african forest overseas to the west indies	and then here in alabama.	3.5224472616792903
4116. with shout and slow dance with tears and	song with scream and contortion the corner group was beset by hysteria	and shivering wailing shouting possession of something that seemed	like an alien and outside force.	4.6309478055466
4117. it spread to most of the audience	and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief	and afterward discussed negro religion.	4.2077103206847575
4118. it sometimes ended in	death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and	floor.	5.870226154598328
4119. to most of those who composed the amen corner it was a magnificent	and beautiful experience something for which they lived from week	to week.	4.247034522261499
4120. it was often re-enacted in less wild form at the wednesday	night prayer meeting.	6.051270214231201
4121. wilson on his first sunday witnessed	this with something like disgust.	4.474299468352516
4122. he had preached a short sermon	trying to talk man-to-man to the audience to tell them who he was what	he had done in macon and birmingham and what he proposed to do here.	4.760592116050365
4123. he sympathized with them on the loss of their old pastor.	5.120120275071695
4124. but then	at mention of that name the amen corner broke loose.	6.110193592166714
4125. he had no	chance to say another word.	5.9526657256350495
4126. at the very end when the audience was silent	and breathless a collection was taken and then slowly everyone	filed out.	6.155471285872634
4127. the audience did not think much of the new pastor and what	the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to	say.	5.042015075892661
4128. during the next weeks he looked over the situation.	7.300326108736377
4129. first	of all there was the parsonage an utterly impossible place for civilized	people to live in originally poorly conceived apparently not	repaired for years with no plumbing or sewage with rat-holes and rot.	3.646654791455286
4130. it was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old	members of the church a woman named catt who as wilson afterward found	was briefly referred to as the cat because of her sharp tongue	and fierce initiative.	5.8542060595656995
4131. ann catt was a lonely devoted soul	never married conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church but	a perpetual dissenter and born critic.	3.4350960928305088
4132. she soared over the new pastor	like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all	the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository.	4.783757007455
4133. then	wilson looked over the church and studied its condition.	4.850128840573058
4134. the salary	of the pastor had for years been $500 annually and even this was in arrears.	4.905429970230287
4135. wilson made up his mind that he must receive at least $2500	but when he mentioned this to the deacons they said nothing.	3.695410396330525
4136. the church	itself must be repaired.	6.5155523300336915
4137. it was dirty and neglected.	6.621443529496009
4138. it really	ought to be rebuilt and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks	about this.	5.8641029742724164
4139. meanwhile the city itself should be talked to.	5.26203574400024
4140. the	streets in the colored section were dirty.	6.743273855772659
4141. there was typhoid and malaria.	7.447114015016074
4142. the children had nowhere to go and no place to play not even sidewalks.	5.411809260583902
4143. the school was small dark and ill-equipped.	5.150388413515226
4144. the teacher was	a pliant fool.	6.814488295072963
4145. there were two liquor saloons not very far from the	church one white that is conducted for white people with a side entrance	for negroes; the other exclusively negro.	3.84245089294403
4146. undoubtedly there	was a good deal of gambling in both.	8.086329276086708
4147. on the other side of the	church	was a quiet well-kept house with shutters and recently painted.	5.015840303475314
4148. it was called kent house.	9.075204844175518
4149. the deacon of the	church carlson was its janitor.	4.1174608023645085
4150. one of the leading members of the	amen corner was cook; there were two or three colored maids employed	there.	6.292723559654256
4151. wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people	which seemed to him rather queer.	5.117267380926489
4152. why should a white hotel be set	down in the center of black bottom?	7.496278519266922
4153.  but nevertheless it looked respectable.	6.236627984188189
4154. he was glad to have it there.	8.81279146153084
4155. the rest of black	bottom was a rabbit warren of homes in every condition of neglect disrepair	and careful upkeep.	3.842174340059263
4156. dives carefully repaired huts and nicely	painted and ornamented cottages were jumbled together cheek by jowl	with little distinction.	5.057556181613073
4157. the best could not escape from the worst and	the worst nestled cosily beside the better.	4.117277020330954
4158. the yards front and back	were narrow; some were trash dumps some had flower gardens.	4.900432726990401
4159. behind	were privies for there was no sewage system.	5.565413808662867
4160. after looking	about a bit wilson discovered beyond black bottom across the river	and far removed from the white city a considerable tract of land	and it occurred to him that the church and the better negro homes might	gradually be moved to this plot.	5.143019408654364
4161. he talked about it to the presiding	elder.	6.6055281356960505
4162. the presiding elder looked him over rather carefully.	5.650577481330174
4163. he was not sure what kind of a man he had in hand.	6.673584458860071
4164. but there was one	thing that he had to stress and that was that the contribution to the	general church expenses the dollar money had been seriously falling	behind in this church and that must be looked after immediately.	5.574550356227487
4165. in	fact he intimated clearly that that was the reason that wilson had	been sent here- to make a larger contribution of dollar money.	4.180079972204457
4166. wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was they must have a	better church a more business-like conduct of the church organization	and an effort to get this religious center out of its rut of wild worship	into a modern church organization.	5.525102717309136
4167. he emphasized to the presiding	elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the	river.	3.8707161351189745
4168. the presiding elder was sure that that would be impossible.	5.963609536658048
4169. but he told wilson to go ahead and try.	5.36094354402508
4170. it did seem impossible.	10.733331114491708
4171. the bank which held the mortgage on the	old church declared that the interest was considerably in arrears and	the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was	being held for an eventual development for white working people who	were coming in and that none would be sold to colored folk.	3.0824076011182715
4172. when it	was proposed to rebuild the church wilson found that the terms for	a new mortgage were very high.	5.871141530790827
4173. he was sure that he could do better if	he went to atlanta to get the deal financed.	4.944462485515732
4174. but when this proposal	was made to his deacon board he met unanimous opposition.	6.230859293181784
4175. the	church certainly would not be removed.	6.401256196955868
4176. the very proposition was sacrilege.	7.302031769799049
4177. it had been here fifty years.	7.8569249090261515
4178. it was going to stay forever.	10.172957468426622
4179. it was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject.	4.663451361017732
4180. as for	rebuilding well that might be looked into but there was no hurry no	hurry at all.	6.788115516410453
4181. wilson again went downtown to a different banker	an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic but	he shook his head.	3.542415248362911
4182. reverend he said i think you don't	quite understand the situation here.	6.721590129025884
4183. don't you see the amount	of money that has been invested by whites around that church?	4.330143201410687
4184.  tenements	stores saloons some gambling i hope not too much.	6.476102398926405
4185. the colored	people are getting employment at kent house and other places and	they are near their places of employment.	3.390604280653994
4186. when a city has arranged	things like this you cannot easily change them.	6.501801200897873
4187. now if i were you i	would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or	ten years.	3.997119009246705
4188. by that time perhaps something better can be done.	7.5565093364649245
4189. then wilson asked what about this kent house which you	mention?	4.692372858589877
4190.  i don't understand why a white hotel should be down here.	6.156832949080374
4191. the young banker looked at him with a certain surprise and	then he said flatly: i'm afraid i can't tell you anything	in particular about kent house.	3.626675851918879
4192. you'll have to find out about it	on your own.	8.03351169472214
4193. hope to see you again.	6.28880152845831
4194. and he dismissed the colored	pastor.	10.147574073974296
4195. it was next day that sojourner came and sat beside	him and took his hand.	4.2169987500942945
4196. she said my dear do you know what kent	house is?	6.990197279408519
4197.    no said wilson i don't.	6.706766627103422
4198. i was	just asking about it.	8.667966011188964
4199. what is it?	10.103359645989507
4200.    it's a house of prostitution	for white men with white girls as inmates.	6.0655028408453715
4201. they hire	a good deal of local labor including two members of our trustee board.	4.921592650258404
4202. they buy some supplies from our colored grocers and they are patronized	by some of the best white gentlemen in town.	6.570848137193877
4203. my dear you must be mistaken.	6.791801177092803
4204. talk to	mrs catt she said.	7.712079578137997
4205. and after wilson had talked to mrs	catt and to others he was absolutely amazed.	4.1832131631277205
4206. this of course was	the sort of thing that used to take place in southern cities- putting	white houses of prostitution with colored girls in colored neighborhoods	and carrying them on openly.	5.2301661106574295
4207. but it had largely disappeared on	account of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on the	part of the negroes as they became more educated and got better wages.	3.671899168822228
4208. but this situation of kent house was more subtle.	7.332713582718339
4209. the wages	involved were larger and more regular.	4.834989706477679
4210. the inmates were white and	from out of town avoiding local friction.	5.7753165464623315
4211. the backing from the white	town was greater and there was little publicity.	4.118618828132038
4212. good wages patronage	and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from negroes.	6.116500889450664
4213. and yet wilson knew that this place must go or he must go.	4.52370843816232
4214. and	for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean	practically the end of his career in the methodist church if not	in all churches.	5.311221952241959
4215. payne dismounted in madison place and handed the reins to herold.	4.182602481535312
4216. there was a fog which increased the darkness of the night.	7.472713131829312
4217. two gas	lamps were no more than a misleading glow.	6.817724584302799
4218. he might have been anywhere	or nowhere.	10.480955640231205
4219. the pretence was that he was delivering a prescription	from dr verdi.	4.71305142990975
4220. secretary of state seward was a sick man.	8.63139480308831
4221. the idea had come from herold who had once been a chemist's clerk.	4.747652828863888
4222. the sick were always receiving medicines.	6.1545431901638175
4223. no one would question	such an errand.	6.671099824432072
4224. the bottle was filled up with flour.	5.8741996040418405
4225. before payne	loomed the old clubhouse seward's home where key had once	been killed.	4.566798315352863
4226. now it would have another death.	9.9741300861353
4227. from the outside it	was an ordinary enough house of the gentry.	5.519351579613597
4228. he clomped heavily up the	stoop and rang the bell.	6.375016808455901
4229. like the bell at mass the doorbell was pitched	too high.	5.138341115383371
4230. it was still good friday after all.	8.451259466327462
4231. a nigger	boy opened the door.	5.534029252097959
4232. payne did not notice him.	7.712079578137997
4233. he was thinking chiefly	of cap.	6.8185940733068335
4234. if their schedules were to synchronize there was no point	in wasting time.	6.989244499705034
4235. he pushed his way inside.	5.926245264679889
4236. for a moment	the hall confused him.	9.095919548811189
4237. this was the largest house he had ever been in	almost the largest building except for a hotel.	4.962792847933793
4238. he had no idea where	seward's room would be.	8.565553830136617
4239. in the half darkness the banisters gleamed	and the hall seemed enormous.	4.516460615659967
4240. above him somewhere were the bedrooms.	8.323299742305736
4241. seward would be up there.	5.619635421798327
4242. he explained his errand but without	bothering much to make it plausible for he felt something well	up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army.	5.221114055224365
4243. he did not	really want to kill but as in the sexual act there was a moment when	the impulse took over and could not be downed even while you watched	yourself giving way to it.	4.263646622895958
4244. he was no longer worried.	10.458493497100728
4245. everything would	be all right.	7.3475207768317805
4246. he knew that in this mood he could not be stopped.	8.706381403175712
4247. still the sensation always surprised him.	6.4740516735916565
4248. it was a thrill he	felt no part in.	7.9938125433297
4249. he could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while	his body did these quick appalling and efficient things.	4.275073007339488
4250. he	brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs.	5.739974350684024
4251. they	were carpeted but made for pumps and congress gaiters not the great	clodhoppers he wore.	4.026693789766533
4252. the sound of his footsteps was like a muffled	drum.	6.578712915254676
4253. at the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there	angrily in a dressing gown.	5.147331318171773
4254. he stopped and whispered his errand.	7.513118219918902
4255. young frederick seward held out his hand.	5.358817711987183
4256. panting a little payne	shook his head.	7.163184125958424
4257. dr verdi had told him to deliver his package in	person.	4.828981862448521
4258. frederick seward said his father was sleeping and then	went through a pantomime at his father's door to prove the statement.	4.861416487662795
4259. i will go.	9.215854181653025
4260. he smiled	but now that he knew where the elder seward was he did not intend	to go.	6.236634593662384
4261. he pulled out his pistol and fired it.	5.030073758487645
4262. it	had misfired.	11.155741451300253
4263. reversing it he smashed the butt down on frederick	seward's head over and over again.	4.170137334693881
4264. it was the first blow	that was always difficult.	9.226416697006796
4265. after that violence was exultantly easy.	6.381580538013001
4266. he got caught up into it and became a different person.	6.494134597339015
4267. only afterwards	did an act like that become meaningless so that he would puzzle over	it for days whereas at the time it had seemed quite real.	4.408871454755913
4268. the nigger boy fled down the stairs screaming murder.	5.4678654398730995
4269. it was not murder at all.	7.151713684940966
4270. payne was more methodical than that.	7.163184125958424
4271. he	was merely clearing a way to what he had to do.	5.387104449018873
4272. he ran for the	sick room found his pistol was broken and threw it away.	5.543182969256612
4273. from childhood he had known all about knives.	5.39278513564796
4274. someone blocked	the door from inside.	7.846410058158326
4275. he smashed it in and tumbled into darkness.	4.862373123883983
4276. he saw only dimly moving figures but when he slashed them they yelled	and fled.	5.811905241772077
4277. he went for the bed jumped on it and struck where he could	repeatedly.	4.704276224912816
4278. it was like finally getting into one's own nightmares	to punish one's dreams.	6.257836787655891
4279. two men pulled him off.	7.289456511424301
4280. payne hacked at their arms.	7.712079578137997
4281. there was a lady there in	a nightdress.	6.94934746360457
4282. he would not have wanted to hurt a lady.	8.92765678164591
4283. another man	approached this one fully dressed.	5.791872566659581
4284. when the knife went into his chest	he went down at once.	6.5692492265144855
4285. i'm mad shouted payne as	he ran out into the hall.	4.895472654948134
4286. i'm mad and only wished he had been.	6.412214371980113
4287. that would have made things so much easier.	6.1072194101344
4288. but he was not mad.	14.18354847123121
4289. he clattered down the stairs and out of	the door.	4.645344995261077
4290. somewhere in the fog the nigger boy was still yelling murder.	6.596882389373085
4291. one always wakes up even from one's own dreams.	4.974375257792562
4292. the clammy air	revived him.	6.996493558081793
4293. herold he saw had fled.	5.619635421798327
4294. well one did not expect	much of people like herold.	7.06699743936743
4295. he unhitched his horse walked	it away mounted and spurred it on.	4.318068015596563
4296. the nigger boy was close	behind him.	6.154713990487742
4297. then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone.	6.1253394794352785
4298. he rode	on and on.	8.978600574448244
4299. he had no idea where he was.	6.738860020715618
4300. after some time he came to	an open field.	7.281201784218422
4301. an open field was better than a building that was for	sure so he dismounted turned off the horse and plunged through the	grass.	3.942340401796129
4302. he felt curiously sleepy the world seemed far away;	he knew he should get to cap but he didn't know how.	5.22017576659068
4303. he was sure	for he had done as he was told hadn't he?	4.874577832902466
4304.  cap would find him	and take care of him.	7.698213588129022
4305. so choosing a good tree he clambered up into it	found a comfortable notch and curled up in it to sleep like the tousled	bear he was with his hands across his chest as though surfeited	with honey.	3.3070907486998173
4306. violence always made him tired but he was not	frightened.	7.257527606237512
4307. in boston edwin booth was winding up a performance	of a new way to pay old debts.	3.9492250631390697
4308. it was a part so familiar	to him that he did not bother to think about it any more.	6.7867240333335275
4309. on a stage he always knew what to do and tonight to judge	by the applause he must be doing it better than usual.	4.161209264531599
4310. as	sir giles overreach	he raised his arm and declaimed: where	is my honour now?	5.583228874976599
4311.    that was one of the high spots of the	play.	7.5102723166075345
4312. the audience as usual loved it.	7.039566964456332
4313. he was delighted to see them	so happy.	6.133546210018861
4314. if he had any worries it was only the small ones about	mother in new york and his daughter edwina and what she might be	doing at this hour with her aunt asia in philadelphia.	5.720276348176184
4315. everyone	is ambivalent about his profession if he has practised it long	enough but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all	those unseen people out there who might cheer you or boo you but that	was largely though not entirely up to you.	3.1403684733245933
4316. they made the	world seem friendly somehow though he knew it was not.	6.093745194599766
4317. wilkes	was quite right about one thing.	5.219666477665999
4318. laura keene had been in the	green room.	7.689449865750985
4319. the commotion had brought her into the wings.	4.1174608023645085
4320. since she	could not act one part suited her as well as any other and so she was	the first person to offer mr lincoln a glass of water holding	it	up to the box high above her head to miss harris who had asked for	it.	4.7355533290170815
4321. she had been one of the first to collect her wits.	8.09825447627433
4322. it was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience as that	they had been stunned already.	6.708834256291146
4323. most of them had seen our american	cousin before and unless miss keene was on stage there was not	much to it.	4.382738570997344
4324. the theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom.	5.7315251322450536
4325. the stage had been empty except for harry hawk doing his star	monologue.	3.8208363397345915
4326. the audience was fond of harry hawk he was a dear	in or out of character but he was not particularly funny.	6.332255979914948
4327. at the end	of the monologue the audience would applaud.	5.304889862402898
4328. meanwhile it looked at	the scenery.	8.844586826375382
4329. well i guess i know enough to turn you inside	out you sockdologizing old mantrap! said trenchard otherwise	hawk.	4.0185533780487015
4330. there was always a pause here before the next line.	7.099761601287082
4331. that was when the gun went off.	6.863803729168046
4332. yet even that explosion did not mean	much.	8.285661751852748
4333. guns were going off all over washington city these days because	of the celebrations and the theatre was not soundproof.	3.5853166747464886
4334. then	the audience saw a small dim figure appear at the edge of the presidential	box.	6.053157772936309
4335. sic semper tyrannis it said mildly.	5.219666477665999
4336. booth	had delivered his line.	8.457718703298294
4337. behind him billowed a small pungent cloud	of smoke.	4.941836524428766
4338. they had not heard what had	been said.	8.875750344766024
4339. they had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily.	6.1271798563230515
4340. the figure leapt from the box almost lost its balance the flag	draped there tore in the air the figure landed on its left leg fell	on its hands and pressed itself up.	4.515841209512108
4341. harry hawk still had his	arm raised towards the wings.	4.477601198394805
4342. he did not lower	his arm.	10.905341734287722
4343. the figure was so theatrically dressed that it was	as though	a character from some other play had blundered into this one.	3.351358387242595
4344. the	play for saturday night was to be a benefit performance of the octoroon.	6.901012276354628
4345. this figure looked like the slave dealer from that.	4.598754639677171
4346. but it	also looked like a toad hopping away from the light.	7.593551999854924
4347. there was something	maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them.	4.952386234405142
4348. then	it disappeared into the wings.	7.712079578137997
4349. harry hawk had not shifted	position but he at last lowered his arm.	4.0683852436856025
4350. there was no mistaking that scream.	9.922120798982213
4351. it was what anyone who had ever	seen her had always expected her to do.	4.2169987500942945
4352. yet this scream had a different	note in it.	7.715954644480498
4353. that absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them	awake like a pail of water.	4.357849039737643
4354. clara harris one of the guests	in the box stood up and demanded water.	6.668949621299593
4355. when something unexpected happened one always asked for water if	one were a woman brandy if one were a man.	3.822658289386455
4356. in the presidential box someone leaned over the	balustrade and yelled: he has shot the president!   that	got everybody up.	5.253526771598501
4357. on the stage harry hawk began to weep.	6.225388032156594
4358. laura	keene	brushed by him with the glass of water.	7.052747790295135
4359. the crowd began to move.	5.453591078244923
4360. in washington city everyone lived in a bubble of plots and one death	might attract another.	5.566833363181239
4361. it was not exactly panic they gave way to	but they could not just sit there.	4.593609396307223
4362. the beehive voices for no one could	bear silence drowned out the sound of mrs lincoln's weeping.	4.997237739021089
4363. at the rear of the auditorium upstairs some men tried to	push open the door to the box corridor.	4.337557910183606
4364. a	dr charles taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to	hoist him up to the box.	6.688809476313551
4365. in the audience a man named ferguson lost	his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob on the same principle	which had led miss harris to demand water.	3.8547270006561116
4366. someone	opened the corridor door from the inside and called for a doctor.	6.470171981238305
4367. somehow	dr charles leale was forced through the mob and squeezed out	into the dingy corridor.	3.8849121559715263
4368. he went straight to the presidential box.	8.630034894378563
4369. as usual mrs lincoln had lost her head but nobody blamed	her for doing so now.	4.189577039423589
4370. there was a little blood on the hem of her dress	for the assassin had slashed miss harris's companion major	rathbone with a knife.	5.616159774180916
4371. rathbone said he was bleeding to death.	5.785871388591392
4372. by	the look of him he wasn't that far gone.	6.144814417540349
4373. with a sneer the man spread his legs and a third time confronted them.	4.552954283581097
4374. once more katie reared and whinnied in fear.	7.892692994377872
4375. for a moment	boy and mount hung in midair.	5.701578202213473
4376. stevie twisted and frantically	commanded the mare to leap straight ahead.	5.9245075971793435
4377. but the stranger was nimbler	still.	6.758574719086649
4378. with a bold arm he dared once more to obstruct them.	6.762842409585631
4379. katie	reared a third time then trembling descended.	4.913686410369733
4380. seizing the bridle he tugged with all his might and forced	katie to her knees.	5.693756837092203
4381. stevie could feel himself toppling.	5.619635421798327
4382. he saw the ground coming up- and the stranger's head.	6.987838347483777
4383. with	incredible ferocity he brought his fists together and struck.	4.477601198394805
4384. the blow	encountered silky hair and hard bone.	5.8743971957932475
4385. the man uttered a weird cry	spun about and collapsed in the sand.	4.250722422220555
4386. katie scrambled to her	feet stevie agilely retaining his seat.	6.144814417540349
4387. again katie reared and now	wickedly he compelled her to bring her hooves down again and again	upon the sprawled figure of the stranger.	3.8923224050734495
4388. he could feel his own feet	iron-shod striking repeatedly until the body was limp.	6.285475128308211
4389. he gloated	and his lips slavered.	5.926245264679889
4390. they rode	around and around to trample the figure into the sand.	6.0639976778550295
4391. only the top	of the head with a spot bare and white as a clamshell remained visible.	4.275086109357477
4392. a train hooted.	9.336316316206462
4393. they were pursuing him.	7.8147857365364715
4394. he was frightened; his fists	clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt.	6.4461731809633225
4395. then katie stumbled	and again he was falling falling!   stevie! stevie!	his mother was nudging him but he was still falling.	4.142222335503257
4396. his head hung	over the boards of katie's stall; before it was sprawled the	mangled corpse of the bearded stranger.	5.379105031788231
4397. stevie wake up now!	we're nearly there.	5.219666477665999
4398. he was safe	in his mama's arms.	8.524995147246532
4399. houses winked	as the cars rolled beside a little depot.	4.477601198394805
4400. po' chavis! the	trainman	called.	9.52328749892442
4401. he came by and repeated po' chavis!	6	bong! bong! startled him awake.	4.460332717612358
4402. the room vibrated as	if a giant hand had rocked it.	5.517940530950313
4403. bong! a dull boom and a throbbing	echo.	4.913686410369733
4404. the walls bulged the floor trembled the windowpanes rattled.	5.467709816875016
4405. he stared at the far morning expecting a pendulum to swing across the	horizon.	4.2077342976206955
4406. bong! he raced to the window and yanked at the sash.	5.739974350684024
4407. bong! the wood was old the paint alligatored.	4.6724501027054846
4408. bong! a	fresh breeze saluted him.	7.712079578137997
4409. six o'clock!   he put his his	head out.	5.762571147543297
4410. there was the slate roof of the church; ivy climbed the	red brick walls like a green-scaled monster.	6.016832967276771
4411. the clock which had struck	presented an innocent face.	4.117333848178848
4412. in the kitchen mama was wiping	the cupboards.	8.405075976657411
4413. there's a tower and a steeple on the church	a million feet high.	4.220078653449768
4414. and the loudest clock in the whole world!	i know stephen she smiled.	7.0347846164617485
4415. they say that our	steeple is one hundred and sixty-two feet high.	5.42025981173971
4416. the clock you heard strike-	it's really the town clock- was installed last april by	mrs shorter on her birthday.	4.65300118167027
4417. he dressed and sped outdoors.	5.926245264679889
4418. he crossed broome street to orange square.	7.042834174643505
4419. the steeple leaned	backward while the church advanced like a headless creature in a	long shapeless coat.	3.5177069743400518
4420. the spire seemed to hold up the sky.	5.806815859690513
4421. port	jervis basking in the foothills was the city of god.	4.959560909177412
4422. the dutch	reformed church with two steeples and its own school was on main	street; the episcopal church was one block down sussex street;	the catholic saint mary's church with an even taller steeple	and a cross on top stood on ball street.	4.1727806703454124
4423. the catholics had the	largest cemetery near the neversink river where main street ran south;	stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds.	3.2970866817098714
4424. god	was everywhere in the belfry in the steeple in the clouds in the	trees and in the mountains hulking on the horizon.	5.338770914342843
4425. somewhere beyond	where shadows lurked must be the yawning pit of which papa preached	and the dreadful lake of fire.	3.842263146596723
4426. so walking in awe he became	familiar with god who resided chiefly in drew centennial church	with its high steeple and clock.	5.168974360490107
4427. there was no church like drew church	no preacher like papa who was intimate with him and could consign	sinners to hellfire.	4.14968801419691
4428. to know god he must follow in papa's	footsteps.	7.015416494771337
4429. he was fortunate and proud.	6.8185940733068335
4430. the veterans idling	on their benches in the square beneath the soldiers' monument got	to	their feet when papa approached: morning reverend! his	being and his will- stevie could not divide god from his papa-	illumined every parish face turned the choir into a band of angels	and the pulpit into the tollgate to heaven.	4.239022138484303
4431. we have nine	hundred and eleven members in our charge mama announced and three	hundred and eighty sunday-school scholars.	4.089348478283234
4432. when papa	went out to do god's work stevie often accompanied him in the buggy	which was drawn by violet the new black mare.	5.504533799465157
4433. although they journeyed	westerly as far as germantown beyond the erie roundhouse and	the machine shop and along the delaware and hudson canal and northward	to brooklyn below point peter he could see the church spire	wherever he looked back.	3.808664135761688
4434. sometimes they went south and rolled past	the tollhouse- afternoon reverend!- and crossed the suspension	bridge to matamoras; that was pennsylvania.	5.332653429726682
4435. in the	delaware river three long islands were overgrown with greening trees	and underbrush.	4.241741874725852
4436. south of laurel grove cemetery and below the	junction of the neversink and the delaware was the tri-state rock	from which stevie could spy new jersey and pennsylvania as well	as new york simply by spinning around on his heel.	4.441699362806228
4437. on these	excursions papa instructed him on man's chief end which was his	duty to god and his own salvation.	4.228067601521502
4438. however a boy's lively eyes might	rove.	8.335646584949512
4439. where cuddleback brook purled into the neversink was a magnificent	swimming hole.	4.7081534146775335
4440. papa pointed a scornful finger at the splashing	youth: idle recreation! stevie saw no idols; it troubled	him that he couldn't always see what papa saw.	4.67288338831304
4441. he was torn between	the excitement in the sun-inflamed waters and a little engine chugging	northward on the monticello branch.	4.022621443431285
4442. where you been	today?	12.241715589721572
4443.  ludie inquired every evening pretending that he did not	care.	5.019153052595238
4444. he'll make a preacher out of you!   no he	won't! stevie flared.	5.739974350684024
4445. not me!   somebody's	got to be a preacher in the family.	5.815579744062239
4446. he made a will and last testament	before we left paterson.	7.1864121519430055
4447. i heard them! uncle and aunt howe were	the witnesses.	4.959473564356109
4448. will he die?	12.261304918537112
4449.    everybody	does.	10.144513917544229

4640. how long did you study?	9.528674673512617
4641.  how long buddy?	9.108157482882993

4643. don't christsake	me buddy! just answer.	5.619635421798327
4644. c'mon- c'mon!	h i'm no hero.	7.712079578137997
4645. did i start the damn war?	5.90440030913687
4646.  h automatically	finnegan started going over today's lesson h capitalism rots from	the core.	6.12142953848099
4647. did i start the damn war?	5.90440030913687
4648.  who did?	14.985624361366707
4649.  that's a good	one.	7.122018278055224
4650. why don't uncle sam mind his own fucken	business?	7.439757318826379
4651.  i'll bet both together did.	5.619635421798327
4652. goddammit.	13.921774766768346
4653. just let me go home to jersey back to the	shore oh jesus the shore.	4.353564542586693
4654. the waves breakin in on you and your girl	at night there on the warm beach in the moonlight even jesus sweet	mary.	5.088784219265461
4655. if i hafta do this to stay alive by god i'll do it.	4.5821685467235405
4656. i	hated the goddamn army from the first day i got in anyhow.	6.304684153586412
4657. all pricks	like coughlin run it anyway one way or another.	5.031091432158644
4658. fuck them h he	rolled over and tried to shut out the noise now much louder.	5.63861728654293
4659. he snuggled	into the blanket h	brandon dreamed.	5.475289483739853
4660. he was sitting	on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water.	5.761254658268715
4661. a	river wide as the missouri where it ran by his place.	4.513365545299474
4662. but he was not.	13.149859830581407
4663. so what?	10.389658501279966
4664.  why should i be spinning just	because the goddamn log is spinning?	6.7598862375673034
4665. 	.	10.144513917544229
4666. over on the bank	the west bank a man stood calling to him.	6.266665668354475
4667. he couldn't make out	what he was saying.	5.131969917669621
4668. no doubt it had to do with the log.	9.733258215969514
4669. why should	he be concerned?	7.70222107681634
4670. 	rousseau is so persuasive that voltaire is almost convinced that	he should burn his books too.	5.2288514545018705
4671. but while the two men are riding into	the country where they are going to dinner they are attacked in	the dark of the forest by a band of thieves who strip them of everything	including most of their clothes.	3.7360204102813293
4672. you must be a very learned	man says voltaire to one of the bandits.	9.75466703707652
4673. a learned	man?	7.943923314894583
4674.  the bandit laughs in his face.	6.154713990487742
4675. he goes to the chief himself.	6.701663555003207
4676. at what university did you	study?	9.867820229728158
4677.  he asks.	8.80323508231408
4678. he refuses to believe that the bandit chief never	attended a higher institution.	7.046263268800614
4679. to have become so corrupt he	says surely you must have studied many arts and sciences.	4.3167856270334735
4680. the chief annoyed by these questions knocks voltaire down and shouts	at him that he not only never went to any school but never even	learned how to read.	4.514879879945659
4681. when finally the two bedraggled men reach	their friend's home voltaire's fears are once again aroused.	4.117575039702405
4682. for it is such a distinguished place with such fine works of art and	such a big library that there can be little doubt but that the owner	has become depraved by all this culture.	5.243669290285506
4683. to voltaire's surprise	however their host gives them fresh clothes to put on opens his	purse to lend them money and sits them down before a good dinner.	3.6054966492479648
4684. immediately after dinner however rousseau asks for still another	favor.	6.6023616528946185
4685. could he have pen and paper please?	5.543910098105182
4686.  he is in a hurry	to write another essay against culture.	8.353260900731588
4687. such was the impromptu	that voltaire gave to howls of laughter at sans souci and that was	soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of europe	to be printed sometime later but with the name of timon of athens	the famous misanthrope substituted for that of rousseau.	3.4397217293123017
4688. how cruel!   but at the same time how understandable.	9.420316124236876
4689. how could	the rich for whom life was made so simple ever understand the subterfuges	the lies the frauds the errors sins and even crimes to	which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages	the rich had in the race of life?	3.3631528405885667
4690.    how for example	could a voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a rousseau	would find himself when soon after the furor of his first discourse	he acquired still another title to fame?	5.286243284419455
4691.    this time	as a musician.	6.436228776205819
4692. ever since he had first begun	to study music and to teach it rousseau had dreamed of piercing through	to fame as the result of a successful opera.	5.489532885373586
4693. but his facility in	this genre was not great.	5.593619114975229
4694. and his efforts to get a performance for his	gallant muses invariably failed.	7.183917526301951
4695. his	operatic music had little merit.	5.619635421798327
4696. but then one day while on a	week's visit to the country home of a retired swiss jeweler rousseau	amused the company with a few little melodies he had written to which	he attached no great importance.	5.197809605313546
4697. he was really amazed to discover	the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs.	4.175349044786341
4698. put a few such songs together they urged him.	7.447373505285723
4699. string them	onto some sort of little plot and you'll have a delightful operetta.	4.378492597167933
4700. nonsense he said.	9.52328749892442
4701. this	is the sort of stuff i write and then throw away!   heaven	forbid! cried the ladies enchanted by his music.	4.1144493322267435
4702. you	must make an opera out of this material.	7.382857030200408
4703. and they wouldn't	leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised.	4.845339559417665
4704. oh	the irony and the bitterness of it! that after all his years of effort	to become a composer he should now now when he was still stoutly	replying to the critics of his discourse on the arts and sciences	be so close to a success in music and have to reject it.	4.593880571798281
4705. or at least appear to reject it!   but what else could he do?	4.937395786133452
4706. 	you couldn't on the one hand decry the arts and at the same time	practice them could you?	6.781807305326525
4707.  well yes perhaps in literature since	you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about your feelings against	literature and so were involved in spite of yourself.	3.8736643794523165
4708. but now music	too?	12.902166024018038
4709.  no.	10.144513917544229
4710. that would be too much!   and the fault of	course was rameau's.	7.5362580670089825
4711. the fault was rameau's and that of the whole	culture of this parisian age.	4.288232923669203
4712. for it was rameau's type of music	that he had been trying to write and that he couldn't write.	7.085524294204909
4713. these	little songs however were sweet nothings from the heart tender	memories of his childhood little melodies that anyone could hum and	that would make one want to weep.	3.368333785817128
4714. he couldn't appear	as a composer now.	7.5139871259533155
4715. that glory craved for so long was now forbidden	to him.	4.834136154242839
4716. still just for the ladies and just for this once for this	one weekend in the country he would make a little piece out of his	melodies.	5.4900875845105315
4717. the ladies were delighted and jean jacques was applauded.	3.9842372028407658
4718. and everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote.	5.874898324968041
4719. but then after the little operetta had been given its feeble	amateur rendering everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost	forever and that the royal academy of music must now have the manuscript	in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited.	3.867766249887943
4720. rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite standing	there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance.	5.429812670161717
4721. the ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him.	4.117365581954828
4722. a contradiction?	10.901804862545303
4723.  bah what was a contradiction in one's life?	4.754469310003367
4724. 	every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes	and saying yes when she meant no.	5.423916548265645
4725. rousseau had to admit that	though he couldn't agree to a public performance he would indeed	just for his own private satisfaction dearly love to know how his work	would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices.	3.4081773092196417
4726. i'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people	seem to think he said.	6.746863309396201
4727. duclos the historian pointed	out to jean jacques that this was impossible.	4.604215637131782
4728. the musicians of the	royal opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound.	5.1901644363202095
4729. merely to satisfy the author's curiosity.	5.443349551690168
4730. but he recalled that rameau had once had a private performance	of his opera armide behind closed doors just for himself alone.	5.479601224597351
4731. duclos understood what was bothering rousseau: that the writer	of the prosopopoeia of fabricius should now become known as the	writer of an amusing little operetta.	3.4050350161502263
4732. that would certainly be paradoxical.	9.761036396703311
4733. but duclos thought he saw a way out.	5.225259001529005
4734. let me do the	submitting to the royal academy he suggested.	7.072885551781956
4735. your name will	never appear.	7.345834942391782
4736. no one will even suspect that it is your work.	8.936136365562644
4737. to that rousseau could agree.	6.337167968018322
4738. but now what crazy twists	and turns of his emotions!   afraid at one and the same time	that his work might be turned down- which would be a blow to his pride	even though no one knew he was the author- and that the work would	be accepted and then that his violent feelings in the matter would	certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself.	5.379644415894898
4739. and	how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause! and thus torn	between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera	and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity	rousseau suffered through several painful weeks.	3.5795857054649725
4740. all these	emotions were screwed up to new heights when after acceptance and	the first rehearsals there ensued such a buzz of excitement among parisian	music lovers that duclos had to come running to rousseau to	inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the king's	amusements and that he was now demanding that the work be offered	first at the royal summer palace of fontainebleau.	4.517252293878134
4741. imagine the honor	of it!   what was your answer?	5.115334488321142
4742.  jean jacques asked	striving to appear unimpressed.	7.653352457740225
4743. what else could i do?	6.6691232906864375
4744.  monsieur de cury was incensed of course.	6.743273855772659
4745. but i said i would first have to get the author's permission.	5.93176756451358
4746. and i was certain he would refuse.	9.247197660474438
4747. how infuriating all	this was! why had not this success come to him before he had plunged	into his discourse and before he had committed himself to a life	of austerity and denial?	3.434778676039306
4748.  now when everything was opening up to	him- even the court of louis 15!- he had to play a role of	self-effacement.	5.768167656157168
4749. back and forth duclos had to go between m	de cury and jean jacques and between the duke d'aumont and jean	jacques again as his little operetta the village soothsayer	though still unperformed took on ever more importance.	3.5544468664287363
4750. and	of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get	around among his closest friends.	5.0827488780537475
4751. but they naturally kept his secret	well and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical	and court circles.	4.220004270433517
4752. how titillating it was to go among people	who did not know him as the composer but who talked in the most	glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first	rehearsals.	5.46040794905299
4753. the furor was such that people who could not possibly have	squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were	intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational.	4.28845753347714
4754. and	listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of	chocolate in a cafe rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration	trembling lest his authorship become known and at the same time dreaming	of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself	suddenly as the composer.	4.600678259029521
4755. he felt himself now as he himself	says in his confessions at a crucial point of his life.	3.934925715121071
4756. and that	was why on the day of the performance when a carriage from the royal	stables called to take him to the palace he did not bother to shave.	6.057529739994312
4757. on the contrary he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of	several days.	4.712299881594571
4758. seeing him in that condition and about to enter	the hall where the king the queen the whole royal family and all	the members of the highest aristocracy would be present grimm and the	abbe raynal and others tried to stop him.	4.704989597386394
4759. you can't	go in that way! they cried.	5.990448704034849
4760. why not?	15.017578564343802
4761.  jean jacques	asked.	9.077043403725945
4762. who is going to stop me?	11.709880491845807
4763.    you haven't dressed	for the occasion! they pointed out to him.	5.576283174652014
4764. i'm	dressed as i always am rousseau said.	6.743273855772659
4765. at home yes they argued.	6.8139036146772085
4766. but here you are	in the palace.	7.8672625272876715
4767. and madame de pompadour.	6.8238542111854175
4768. if they are here then surely i have the right to be here	rousseau said.	8.039598047117055
4769. since i am the composer!	but in such a slovenly condition.	5.5911688261697785
4770. what	is slovenly about me?	8.581068652988327
4771.  rousseau asked.	8.12896173865557
4772. is it because of my slovenliness	that hair grows on my face?	6.9455357431879365
4773.  surely it would grow there	whether	i washed myself or not.	4.523830550283399
4774. a hundred years ago i would have worn	a beard with pride.	6.7427560712266486
4775. and those without beards would have stood out as	not dressed for the occasion.	4.298861729738961
4776. now times have changed and i must pretend	that hair doesn't grow on my face.	5.926028190822232
4777. and	fashion is the real king here.	5.487169663133554
4778. not louis 15 since even he obeys.	7.934733574561326
4779. now if you don't mind i should like to hear my own piece performed.	4.7315263651150845
4780. but of course behind his boldness he didn't feel bold	at all.	6.105149342998739
4781. he trembled lest his piece should fail.	5.131969917669621
4782. and this in addition	to his usual fear of being among people of high society.	6.255564697439588
4783. his fear	of making some inane or inappropriate remark.	4.876738007440362
4784. and even deeper than	that: his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to	relieve himself.	5.575828922251407
4785. could he walk out in the midst of his piece?	6.29620994898005
4786.  here	before the court?	9.52328749892442
4787.  before the king?	9.92615755917254
4788. 	it was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began.	7.2146447697710565
4789. the rider from concord was as good as his word.	4.452626964747356
4790. he came spurring	and whooping down the road his horse kicking up clouds of dust	shouting:   they're a-coming! by god they're a-coming	they are!   we heard him before he ever showed and we	heard him yelling after he was out of sight.	4.721689345053912
4791. solomon chandler hadn't	misjudged the strength of his lungs not at all.	4.542927090098684
4792. i think you could	have heard him a mile away and he was bursting at every seam with	importance.	6.804746748674276
4793. i have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole	character of a man and when a very small man is up on a saddle he'd	like as not prefer to eat his meals there.	3.845825077899865
4794. that's understandable	and i appreciate the sentiment.	7.163184125958424
4795. as for this rider i never saw	him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted so whether he stood	tall or short in his shoes i can't say; but i do know that	he gave the day tone and distinction.	3.4406580500711628
4796. the last thing in the world that	resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics	perched on top of a stone wall and this dashing rider made us feel	a good deal sharper and more alert to the situation.	4.899010487111908
4797. we came	down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us and we crouched behind	it.	4.969300808126832
4798. i have heard people talk with contempt about the british regulars	but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of	which they are deplorably ignorant.	5.383263566114576
4799. whatever we felt about the redcoats	we respected them in terms of their trade which was killing; and	i know that i myself was nauseated with apprehension and fear and	that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun.	3.540000707530681
4800. i wanted to wipe	my flint but i didn't dare to the state my hands were in just	as i didn't dare to do anything about the priming.	5.715170333391751
4801. the gun would	fire or not just as chance willed.	3.9842655512562555
4802. i put a lot more trust in my two	legs than in the gun because the most important thing i had learned	about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it.	5.27504010782758
4803. the gunfire which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the	road now stopped for long enough to count to twenty; and in that	brief	interval a redcoat officer came tearing down the road whipping	his horse fit to kill.	3.0258172559026573
4804. i don't know whether he was after our rider	who had gone by a minute before or whether he was simply scouting conditions;	but when he passed us by a musket roared and he reared his	horse swung it around and began to whip it back in the direction	from which he had come.	4.6781220591485555
4805. he was a fine and showy rider but his skill	was wasted on us.	4.787093555940648
4806. from above me and somewhere behind me a rifle cracked.	6.859128720264447
4807. the redcoat officer collapsed like a punctured bolster and the	horse reared and threw him from the saddle except that one booted foot	caught in the stirrup.	3.333082602415025
4808. half crazed by the weight dragging the dust	and the heat the horse leaped our wall dashing out the rider's brains	against it and leaving him lying there among us- while the horse	crashed away through the brush.	4.460289825585891
4809. it was my initiation to war	and the insane symphony war plays; for what had happened on the common	was only terror and flight; but this grinning broken head not	ten feet away from me was the sharp definition of what my reality had	become.	3.4452921811169572
4810. and now the redcoats were coming and the gunfire was	a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us.	7.15367770365458
4811. i must state	that the faster things happened the slower they happened; the passage	and rhythm of time changed and when i remember back to what happened	then each event is a separate and frozen incident.	3.3816748545518465
4812. in my recollection	there was a long interval between the death of the officer and	the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoats and in that interval	the dust cloud over the road seems to hover indefinitely.	6.110226540661041
4813. yet	it could not have been more than a matter of seconds and then the front	of the british army came into view.	4.863250639995795
4814. it was only hours since	i had last seen them but they had changed and i had changed.	6.288084275421832
4815. in	the very front rank two men were wounded and staggered along trailing	blood behind them.	4.1899779540766815
4816. no drummers here no pipers and the red coats	were covered with a fine film of dust.	5.950070877977108
4817. they marched with bayonets fixed	and as fixed on their faces was anger fear and torment.	3.9789745378525514
4818. rank after	rank of them came down the road and the faces were all the same	and they walked in a sea of dust.	5.01773860851497
4819. committeemen hold your fire!	hold your fire! a voice called and what made it even more	terrible	and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant	only some of them glancing toward the stone wall from behind which	the voice came.	3.347207667342597
4820. the front of their column had already passed	us when another officer came riding down the side of the road not	five paces from where we were.	5.550309909763439
4821. my cousin simmons carried a musket	but he had loaded it with bird shot and as the officer came opposite	him he rose up behind the wall and fired.	3.7143693298065794
4822. one moment there was a man	in the saddle; the next a headless horror on a horse that bolted through	the redcoat ranks and during the next second or two we all of	us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers.	4.725033058290288
4823. one moment	the road was filled with disciplined troops marching four by four	with a purpose as implacable as death; the next a cloud of gun smoke	covered a screaming fury of sound out of which the redcoat soldiers	emerged with their bayonets and their cursing fury.	3.3976629513345626
4824. in the course	of this they had fired on us; but i have no memory of that.	6.150889639598091
4825. i	had squeezed the trigger of my own gun and to my amazement it had	fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule;	and then i was adding my own voice to the crescendo of sound hurling	more vile language than i ever thought i knew sobbing and shouting	and aware that if i had passed water before it was not enough	for my pants were soaking wet.	3.2640781986902723
4826. i would have stood there and died	there if left to myself but cousin simmons grabbed my arm in his	viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there; and then i came	to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that i	outdistanced cousin simmons by far.	4.564639456826503
4827. later	we realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall.	4.0683852436856025
4828. their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching.	5.977408068220055
4829. we tumbled to a stop in deacon gordon's cow hole a low-lying	bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle.	3.644374691078524
4830. a dozen	cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane as perhaps	we were at that moment with the crazy excitement of our first encounter	the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road and the	thirst of some of the men which was so great that they waded into the	muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it.	4.669021127136337
4831. isaac pitt one of the	men from lincoln had taken a musket ball in his belly; and though	he had found the strength to run with us now he collapsed and lay on	the ground dying the reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow.	3.1557513550506835
4832. it may appear that we were cruel and callous but no one had time	to spend sympathizing with poor isaac- except the reverend.	5.385377130817748
4833. i know	that i myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn	open by a british musket ball as isaac had been yet i also felt	relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself.	3.9284959277922447
4834. i was drunk	with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from	the road and the fact that i was not afraid now but only waiting	to know what to do next.	5.644562733523607
4835. meanwhile i reloaded my gun as the	other men were doing.	4.714577589023409
4836. we were less than a quarter of a mile from the	road and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and	dust that hung over it.	5.496423183738572
4837. wherever you looked you saw committeemen	running across the meadows some away from the road some toward it some	parallel to it; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least	fifty militia were making their way in our direction.	3.538038360933047
4838. cousin	joshua and some others felt that we should march toward lexington	and take up new positions ahead of the slow-moving british column but	another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this	section of road.	4.7655572305763165
4839. i didn't offer any advice but i certainly did not	want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out.	3.7242067824596687
4840. someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it	the british would be gone; but cousin simmons said he had watched	them marching west early in the morning and moving at a much brisker	pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass what with	the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts.	4.7725074003653996
4841. while this was being discussed we saw the militia to the west	of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters of two and three	men as they approached the road.	3.4441162455088215
4842. it was the opinion of some of us that	these must be part of the committeemen who had been in the battle	of the north bridge which entitled them to a sort of veteran status	and we felt that if they employed this tactic it was likely enough	the best one.	5.9459069323398195
4843. mattathias dover said:   it makes sense.	5.219666477665999
4844. if	we cluster together the redcoats can make an advantage out of it	but there's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of	us except chase us and we can outrun them.	4.821041850982427
4845. that settled it	and we broke into parties of two and three.	4.648375862175074
4846. cousin joshua dover	decided	to remain with the reverend and poor isaac pitt until life passed away-	and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world.	4.815363986057713
4847. i went off with cousin simmons who maintained that if he didn't	see to me he didn't know who would.	4.158764234545729
4848. good heavens adam	he said i thought one thing you'd have no trouble learning	is when to get out of a place.	6.186874159380748
4849. i learned that now	i said.	6.312730433217405
4850. we ran east for about half a mile before we turned back	to the road panting from the effort and soaked with sweat.	5.21412162136639
4851. there	was a clump of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road	and the shouting and gunfire never slackened.	4.059902439741271
4852. under the trees	there was a dead redcoat a young boy with a pasty white skin and	a face full of pimples who had taken a rifle ball directly between the	eyes.	5.051509930466518
4853. three men were around him.	6.6388609918393415
4854. they had stripped him of his musket	and equipment and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off.	6.207368886903003
4855. cousin simmons grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away.	4.728705066816107
4856. god's name what are you to rob the dead with the fight	going on! cousin simmons roared.	5.138210239895059
4857. they tried to outface	him but joseph simmons was as wide as two average men and it would	have taken braver men than these were to outface him.	3.552855072504019
4858. that summer the gambling houses were closed despite the threats	of pierre ameaux a gaming-card manufacturer.	5.683388457990671
4859. dancing was no longer	permitted in the streets.	4.913686410369733
4860. the bordel and other places of prostitution	were emptied.	5.650577481330174
4861. the slit breeches had to go.	4.484814815711922
4862. drunkenness was no	longer tolerated.	8.457718703298294
4863. in defiance a chinless reprobate jake camaret	marched down the aisle in st peter's one sunday morning followed	by one of the women from the bordel whose dress and walk plainly	showed the lack of any shame.	3.868996723423246
4864. plunking themselves down on the front	bench they turned to smirk at those around them.	5.898763255560353
4865. john's first	impulse was to denounce their blasphemy.	4.913686410369733
4866. but the thought occurred	that god would want this opportunity used to tell them about him.	5.8456826011659615
4867. calmly	he opened the bible and read of the woman at the well.	4.270370688412671
4868. he finished	the worship service as if there had been no brazen attempt to dishonor	god and man.	5.92289036960085
4869. the next morning as the clock struck nine	he appeared at the council meeting in the town hall and insisted	that the couple would have to be punished if the church was to be respected.	4.205074986183645
4870. i have told you before and i tell you again monsieur	favre said rudely.	6.275002354516759
4871. stick to the preaching of the gospel!	john stiffened in anger.	4.583132924694304
4872. that is the answer the ungodly	will always make when the church points its fingers at their sins.	6.31087219854936
4873. i say to you that the church will ever decry evil!   john's	reply was like a declaration of war.	4.543814521295638
4874. monsieur favre sat down	in his high-backed stall lips compressed eyes glinting.	5.739974350684024
4875. ablard corne	a short man with a rotunda of stomach rose.	4.834588311894271
4876. every eye was on him	as he began to speak.	7.7417410610169926
4877. what master calvin says is true.	6.089298979665242
4878. how can we have a good city unless we respect morality?	8.243282213587877
4879.    abel	poupin a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes got to	his feet.	4.016099774068625
4880. we all know that jake camaret and the woman are brazenly	living together.	6.214376324783484
4881. it would be well to show the populace how we deal	with adulterers.	5.285514449613888
4882. philibert berthelier the son of the famous	patriot disagreed.	7.8352736876560085
4883. do not listen to that frenchman.	6.808575376396415
4884. he is throttling	the liberty my father gave his life to win!   john	was quietly insistent.	6.001694891453063
4885. there can be no compromise when souls are	in jeopardy.	6.525725770819871
4886. a week later the sentence of the council was	carried out: jake camaret and the woman were marched naked through	the streets past a mocking populace.	4.904534202268093
4887. before them stalked the beadle	proclaiming as he went thus the council deals with those who break	its laws- adulterers thieves murderers and lewd persons.	3.7562930329980087
4888. let	evildoers contemplate their ways and let every man beware!	john's thoughts raced painfully into the past as he read the letter	he had just received from his sister mary.	4.645845162285738
4889. charles had died two	weeks before in early november without being reconciled to the church.	4.035160961016223
4890. the canons in a body had tried to force him on his deathbed to	let them give him the last rites of the church but he had died still	proclaiming salvation by faith.	5.127409172328658
4891. burial had taken place at night in	the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet so that his enemies	could not find his body and have it dug up and burned.	3.3128539597280713
4892. the abbot	of st eloi claude de mommor had been a good friend but not	even he thought charles deserved burial in hallowed ground.	4.81300505145793
4893. john	closed his eyes and saw once again the little niche in his mother's	bedroom where she had knelt to tell the good virgin of her needs.	3.547882086058036
4894. the blue-draped virgin was still there but no one knelt before her	now.	5.210458303045424
4895. not even varnessa; she too prayed only to god.	5.1355111141896295
4896. for an	instant john longed for the sound of the bells of noyon-la-sainte	the touch of his mother's hand the lilt of charles's voice in the	square raftered rooms his father's bass tones rumbling to the canons	and the sight of the beloved bishop.	4.614783313778312
4897. but he had to follow the light.	8.33709099622563
4898. unless god expected a man to believe the holy scriptures why	had he given them to him?	6.166902886332299
4899. 	the white-clad trees stood like	specters in the february night.	4.477601198394805
4900. snow buried the streets and covered	the slanting rooftops as john trudged toward st peter's.	5.5075207858037265
4901. a carriage	crunched by its dim lights filtering through the gloom.	4.447651850601922
4902. the	sharp wind slapped at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow penetrated	the holes of his shoes his only ones now patched with folded parchment.	4.592172810941962
4903. the city had recently given him a small salary but it was not	enough to supply even necessities.	4.129661488401283
4904. as he neared the square a	round figure muffled in a long black cape whisked by.	6.665197070200918
4905. john recognized	ablard corne and called out a greeting.	5.266516953968173
4906. how grateful he was to such	men! there were several on the council who tried to live like christians.	6.0283321371241385
4907. despite their efforts the problems seemed to grow graver	all the time.	4.675845415108053
4908. quickening his steps john entered the vast church and	climbed the tower steps to the bells.	5.2288514545018705
4909. underneath the big one in the	silent moonlight lay a dead pigeon and on the smaller bell the clemence	two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold	winter air.	3.5912827291740865
4910. john leaned upon the stone balustrade.	8.26952742581369
4911. he brushed	back his black hair shoving it under his pastor's cap to keep it	from blowing in his eyes.	3.7125232616762074
4912. below the moon-splashed world rolled away	to insurmountable white peaks; above him the deep blue sky glittered	with stars.	5.466686532694821
4913. he stood very still his arms at his sides staring up	at the heavens then down at the blinking lights below.	3.7935753958449587
4914. how	long my lord?	9.52328749892442
4915.  how long?	10.826956502987661
4916.  i have never asked for an easy task	but i am weary of the strife.	6.487040273756879
4917. sleep was difficult these days.	5.619635421798327
4918. severe headaches were frequent.	8.457718703298294
4919. loneliness	tore through him like a physical pain whenever he thought of peter	robert nerien nicholas cop martin bucer and even the compromising	louis du tillet.	3.726920045645068
4920. an occasional traveler from italy brought	news of peter robert who was now distributing his bible among the	waldensian peasants.	5.229624859382525
4921. letters came regularly from nerien nicholas	and martin.	5.245620235623163
4922. he had anthony and william to confide in and consult.	6.888195262259749
4923. but william continued to find a bitter joy in smashing images and	tearing down symbols sacred to the old church.	4.261774378808983
4924. john found it difficult	but he held him in check.	6.862608362248226
4925. and anthony was busy most of the time	courting this girl and that.	5.06030200976824
4926. his easy good looks made him a favorite	with the ladies.	6.359710206121339
4927. geneva instead of becoming the city of god	as john had dreamed had in the two years since he had been there	continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished.	4.2054587552068625
4928. refugees poured in signing the confession and rules in order to remain	and then disregarding them.	6.02827997315874
4929. dice rolled prostitutes plied their	trade thieves stole murderers stabbed and the ungodly blasphemed.	3.9701983041559052
4930. catholics who were truly christians longed for the simple penance of	days gone by.	5.601116406433892
4931. libertines recalled the heroism of the past and demanded:	are we going to allow the protestant pope master calvin	to curtail our liberty?	4.159147013858541
4932.  h why oh why doesn't he stick to preaching	the gospel instead of meddling in civic affairs politics	economics and social issues that are no concern of the church?	4.973882254550533
4933. 	and john's reply was always the same: anything that affects	souls is the concern of the church! we will have righteousness!	tears burned behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated tonight.	3.439386436849258
4934. unless the confusion cleared he would not be coming here much	longer.	8.215349175313282
4935. monsieur favre's threat would become a reality for he continued	to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of that frenchman.	3.795312936007946
4936. the slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming	up to the tower interrupted his reverie.	4.704906939686849
4937. faint at first the tapping	grew until it sounded loud against the wind.	4.198097564983883
4938. what is he doing here at this hour?	8.363020074750224
4939.  he started down the	steps to meet the near-blind preacher who had been one of the early gospelers	in paris.	5.425469762803326
4940. john?	13.921774766768346
4941.  is that you?	9.196478733960625
4942.  i came to warn	you of a plot!   john stood above him his face ashen.	6.286608474270452
4943. what	now?	10.144513917544229
4944.  slowly like a man grown old he took eli's hand and led	him below to the tower study guiding him to a chair beside the little	hearth where a fire still burned.	4.630331835224562
4945. monsieur favre just paid me a visit.	4.913686410369733
4946. i went to	your rooms and anthony told me you were here.	6.1538186760307525
4947. two anabaptists caroli	and benoit are to challenge you and william to a debate before	the council.	4.121762438967614
4948. it is to be a trap.	14.278389936019394
4949. you know the law: if you lose the	debate after accepting a challenge you will be banished!	what will be the subject?	4.8527210599243995
4950.    you are to be accused	of arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal.	7.54704072263713
4951. anger	and fear fused in john.	5.619635421798327
4952. ever since the fourth century a controversy	had raged over the person of christ.	6.351375342984002
4953. those who refused to believe	that he was the eternal son of god were termed arianists.	5.371458276265984
4954. peter	caroli had come to geneva saying that he had been a bishop of the	church of rome and had been persecuted in paris for his reformed faith.	5.876751967079273
4955. he asked to be appointed a preacher.	5.80142444720128
4956. but michael sept had unmasked	him revealing he had never been a bishop but was an anabaptist	afraid to state his faith because he knew john calvin had written	a book against their belief that the soul slept after death.	4.917603832003823
4957. so john	had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher and now caroli	sought revenge.	4.117138012383806
4958. if william agrees we should	insist on a public debate he said at length.	6.003010377893419
4959. there	is more to the conspiracy.	7.543209416213238
4960. bern demands that the lord's supper be	administered here as it used to be with unleavened bread.	5.9233377374053
4961. furthermore	bern decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the council	preach only the word of god and stop meddling in politics!	it was always the spirit with christ; matters such as leavened	or unleavened bread are inconsequential.	3.6907768057656134
4962. geneva must remain a sovereign	state.	7.712079578137997
4963. we will not yield to the demands of bern!   the	firelight played over eli's flowing white locks and rugged features.	4.43255499456195
4964. monsieur favre indicated that if i would co-operate after you	and william are banished following the debate i will be given a	place of influence.	5.165610845171135
4965. what was your reply to that?	6.7780763775801764
4966. 	that i would rather be banished with two such christians than	be made the chief syndic!	the following morning as	john entered the place molard on his way to visit a sick refugee	he had a premonition of danger.	4.558724995082364
4967. then suddenly a group of men and dogs	circled him.	6.45734303776825
4968. he wanted to run but he knew that if he did he would	be lost.	7.7096464010021455
4969. he stood very still his heart thumping wildly.	4.861904554845803
4970. on the outskirts	of the rabble the camaret brothers and gaspard favre shook their	fists.	6.1193877309393025
4971. are you going to comply with the demands of bern?	5.584065257734522
4972. 	the chinless jake called.	8.457718703298294
4973. arianist! a rowdy with	a big blob of a nose roared.	4.317068102383446
4974. heretic!   john lifted	his hand for silence.	7.163184125958424
4975. know this: the ministers will not yield to	the demands of bern.	4.234818519638049
4976. his voice shook a little.	8.16490567933018
4977. for an instant john was stunned.	6.78254729550445
4978. when he felt	the side of his head his fingers came away covered with blood.	6.379861841844408
4979. before	he could duck another stone struck him.	4.913686410369733
4980. let	him be now! pierre ameaux the gaming-card manufacturer said	his little pig eyes glaring.	5.448482501884564
4981. we have taught him a lesson.	6.494025095583245
4982. the crowd moved back and john started dizzily down the hill.	5.637604553511676
4983. fists	pummeled him as he staggered forward.	5.219666477665999
4984. then he slipped and went	down on his hands and knees in the melting snow.	6.592521910612344
4985. at once a bevy of dogs	was snapping and snarling around him.	5.337220365287433
4986. one more horrible than the	rest lunged growling deep in his throat his hair bristling.	5.916220655495106
4987. with great	difficulty john clambered to his feet and started to run sweat	pouring down his face.	4.559102708338663
4988. standing in the shelter of the tent- a rejected hospital tent	on which the rain now dripped no longer drumming- adam watched his	own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid	across two beef barrels.	4.415705787655495
4989. there was of course no real need to rearrange	everything.	6.154367112832826
4990. a quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake or	the toffee or the barley sugar or the sardines or the bitters or	the condensed milk or the stationery or the needles- what could it	mean?	4.565424377270054
4991.  adam watched his own hands make the caressing anxious movement	that when rain falls and nobody comes and ruin draws close like	a cat rubbing against the ankles has been the ritual of stall	vendors forever.	3.4275364045219803
4992. he knew its meaning.	10.372205505855671
4993. he had seen a dry old yellowing hand reach out with that painful	solicitude to touch to rearrange to shift aimlessly some object	worth a pfennig.	3.6713427774218657
4994. back in bavaria he had seen that gesture and at	that sight his heart had always died within him.	5.401422114649072
4995. on such occasions he	had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand whatever	face it might be.	4.551399686409254
4996. now the face was his own.	9.182378013472894
4997. he wondered what	expression as he made that gesture was on his face.	4.595316090857999
4998. he wondered if	it wore the old anxiety or the old taut stoicism.	5.752586250134144
4999. but there was no	need he remembered for his hand to reach out for his face to show	concern or stoicism.	4.185335552200918
5000. it was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came.	6.7758976284081
5001. then why was he assuming the role- the gesture and the suffering?	4.470008072188126
5002. 	what was he expiating?	8.457718703298294
5003.  or was he now taking the role- the gesture	and the suffering- because it was the only way to affirm his	history and identity in the torpid befogged loneliness of this land.	4.350944544949809
5004. he looked out of the tent at the	company street.	7.832416654359197
5005. the rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street.	3.8735073349504368
5006. beyond that misty gray of the rain he saw the stretching hutment	low diminutive log cabins chinked with mud with doorways a man would	have to crouch to get through with roofs of tenting laid over boughs	or boards from hardtack boxes or fence rails with cranky chimneys	of sticks and dried mud.	4.387580772373323
5007. the chimney of the hut across from him was	surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked out.	3.428445430010395
5008. in this heavy air	however that device did not seem to help.	7.287896069965936
5009. the smoke from that chimney	rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other and hung as sadly in the	drizzle creeping back down along the sopping canvas of the roof.	3.1524173757203546
5010. over the door was a board with large inept lettering: home	sweet home.	6.438095291628906
5011. this was the hut of simms purdew the hero.	5.678471337869459
5012. the men were huddled in those lairs.	7.1972796674481145
5013. adam knew the names of some.	5.807161320881764
5014. he	knew the faces of all hairy or shaven old or young fat or thin suffering	or hardened sad or gay good or bad.	4.927488949670076
5015. when they stood about	his tent chaffing each other exchanging their obscenities cursing command	or weather he had studied their faces.	4.031120850496674
5016. he had had the need to	understand what life lurked behind the mask of flesh behind the oath	the banter the sadness.	5.30519391445392
5017. once covertly looking at simms purdew the	only man in the world whom he hated he had seen the heavy slack	bestubbled jaw open and close to emit the cruel obscene banter and had	seen the pale-blue eyes go watery with whisky and merriment and suddenly	he was not seeing the face of that vile creature.	3.5357805451791604
5018. he was seeing	somehow the face of a young boy the boy simms purdew must once	have been a boy with sorrel hair and blue eyes dancing with gaiety	and the boy mouth grinning trustfully among the freckles.	5.072372282315063
5019. in that	moment of vision adam heard the voice within himself saying: i	must not hate him i must not hate him or i shall die.	3.487202006732959
5020. his	heart suddenly opened to joy.	7.712079578137997
5021. he thought that if once only	once he could talk with simms purdew something about his own life	and all life would be clear and simple.	3.5311927168088224
5022. if simms purdew would turn	to him and say: adam you know when i was a boy it was a funny	thing happened.	6.378974874158332
5023. lemme tell you now-   if only simms	purdew could do that whatever the thing he remembered and told.	3.874382734896379
5024. it	would be a sign for the untellable and he adam would understand.	5.605795190196547
5025. now adam in the gray light of afternoon stared across at the	hut opposite his tent and thought of simms purdew lying in there	in the gloom snoring on his bunk with the fumes of whisky choking the	air.	3.303139785611587
5026. he saw the sign above the door of the hut: home sweet home.	6.295178841455809
5027. he saw the figure of a man in a poncho coming up the company street	with an armful of wood.	4.813973070388183
5028. it was pullen james the campmate	of simms purdew.	7.251726844419799
5029. he carried the wood carried the water did the	cooking cleaning and mending and occasionally got a kick in the butt	for his pains.	3.6022615156562043
5030. adam watched the moisture flow from the poncho.	6.497454786249132
5031. it	gave the rubberized fabric a dull gleam like metal.	4.477601198394805
5032. pullen james humbly	lowered his head pushed aside the hardtack-box door of the hut	and was gone from sight.	5.057556181613073
5033. adam stared at the door and remembered	that simms purdew had been awarded the medal of honor for gallantry	at antietam.	3.813899935245838
5034. the street was again empty.	7.5514094384954875
5035. the drizzle was	slacking off now but the light was grayer.	4.030465486946981
5036. with enormous interest	adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the	board directly before him.	5.3550900598944216
5037. into the emptiness of the street and his	spirit moved a form.	4.368325273265551
5038. the form was swathed in an army blanket	much patched fastened at the neck with a cord.	5.109030640821245
5039. from under the shapeless	huddle of blanket the feet moved in the mud.	4.68982535843698
5040. the feet wore army	shoes in obvious disrepair.	5.8741996040418405
5041. the head was wrapped in a turban and on	top of the turban rode a great hamper across which a piece of poncho	had been flung.	3.7128115558029275
5042. the gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle.	5.467787620622768
5043. moisture ran down the cheeks gathered at the tip of the nose and at	the chin.	3.99106611072331
5044. the figure was close enough now for him to see the nose twitching	to dislodge the drop clinging there.	5.551343627876905
5045. the figure stopped and one	hand was perilously freed from the hamper to scratch the nose.	3.5176727196839748
5046. then	the figure moved on.	8.457718703298294
5047. this was one of the irish women who had	built their own huts down near the river.	4.99007973922153
5048. adam recognized	this one.	9.741340483702228
5049. he recognized her because she was the one who in	a winter twilight on the edge of camp had once stopped him and reached	down her hand to touch his fly.	3.6746740295995632
5050. slice o' mutton bhoy?	8.457718703298294
5051. 	she had queried in her soft guttural.	4.913686410369733
5052. slice o' mutton?	9.52328749892442
5053. 	her name was mollie.	6.162967476035402
5054. they called her mollie the mutton and laughed.	7.0964106512121
5055. looking down the street after her adam saw that she had again	stopped and again removed one hand from the basket.	3.867111676529927
5056. he could not make	out but he knew that again she was scratching her nose.	6.789265493220973
5057. mollie the	mutton was scratching her nose.	5.219666477665999
5058. the words ran crazily in his	head: mollie the mutton is scratching her nose in the rain.	4.8881068787944
5059. then the words fell into a pattern: mollie the mutton	is scratching her nose scratching her nose in the rain.	3.978040213511723
5060. mollie the	mutton is scratching her nose in the rain.	6.144814417540349
5061. the pattern would not stop.	5.008752558366718
5062. it came	again and again.	10.311703722752974
5063. he felt trapped in that pattern in the repetition.	4.977576424135075
5064. suddenly he thought he might weep.	8.516163245746041
5065. what's the matter with	me?	6.162967476035402
5066.  he demanded out loud.	8.978600574448244
5067. he looked wildly around at the now	empty street at the mud at the rain.	4.11929854175388
5068. oh what's the matter with	me?	8.887941185542141
5069.  he demanded.	8.80323508231408
5070. when he had stored his stock in the great	oak chest locked the two big hasps and secured the additional chain	tied the fly of the tent and picked up the cash box he moved up	the darkening street.	5.008843390616425
5071. he would consign the cash box into the hands of	jed hawksworth then stand by while his employer checked the contents	and the list of items sold.	3.892471217136205
5072. then he-   then what?	9.786098029140714
5073.  he did	not know.	7.547646458792882
5074. his mind closed on that prospect as though fog had descended	to blot out a valley.	5.371290391916615
5075. far off in the dusk he heard voices	singing muffled but strong.	4.551376768577177
5076. in one of the huts a group of men were	huddled together singing.	9.574052002923132
5077. he heard	the words: rock of ages cleft for me let me	hide myself in thee! let the water and the blood from thy riven	side h   he thought: i am a jew from	bavaria.	3.6989298352834084
5078. he was standing there he thought in virginia	in the thickening dusk in a costly greatcoat that had belonged to another	jew.	5.2270642735088835
5079. that other jew a young man too had left that greatcoat	behind in a rich house and marched away.	4.103476617804388
5080. he had crossed the river which	now beyond the woods yonder was sliding darkly under the mist.	5.709907892248851
5081. he had plunged into the dark woods beyond.	5.570660943487726
5082. what had that man that other young jew felt as he stood in the twilight	and heard other men far away singing together?	5.048091661192225
5083. .	10.144513917544229
5084. adam	thought of the hutments regiment after regiment row after row the	thousands of huts stretching away into the night.	4.985333447698777
5085. he thought of the	men the nameless thousands huddling in them.	4.82539684993615
5086. he thought of simms	purdew snoring on his bunk while pullen james crouched by the hearth	skirmishing an undershirt for lice and a wet log sizzled.	4.9403419684308645
5087. he thought	of simms purdew who once had risen at the edge of a cornfield	a	maniacal scream on his lips and swung a clubbed musket like a flail	to beat down the swirl of rebel bayonets about him.	3.4981709179360667
5088. he thought	of simms purdew rising up fearless in glory.	6.375016808455901
5089. he felt the sweetness	of pity flood through him veining his very flesh.	4.424679239286896
5090. those men lying	in the huts they did not know.	7.972353765146908
5091. they did not know who they were or	know their own worth.	5.349492372789935
5092. in the pity for them his loneliness was gone.	6.714689360651815
5093. then he thought of aaron blaustein standing in his rich house	saying: god is tired of taking the blame.	4.452812686585098
5094. he is going to let	history take the blame for a while.	8.14335653468525
5095. he thought of the old	man laughing under the glitter of the great chandelier.	5.15244278813562
5096. he thought:	only in my heart can i make the world hang together.	6.418792211101454
5097. adam rose from the crouch necessary to enter the hut.	5.26902323882756
5098. he saw mose	squatting by the hearth breaking up hardtack into a pan.	5.92870996020284
5099. a pot was	boiling on the coals.	5.148049710636422
5100. done give ole buckra all his money?	6.743273855772659
5101. 	mose asked softly.	6.939425769494729
5102. and look what he done give us.	7.261816056760863
5103. adam looked	at the pot.	6.2862655823088245
5104. what is it?	13.865296900610126
5105.  he asked.	8.80323508231408
5106. chicken mose	said and theatrically licked his lips.	6.743273855772659
5107. gre't big fat chicken	yeah.	6.162967476035402
5108. he licked his lips again.	8.132854117812016
5109. a chicken	with six tits and a tail lak a corkscrew.	4.274675675810666
5110. and hit squealed for	slop.	9.364251482902349
5111. fooled you huh?	6.939425769494729
5112.  it is the same ole same	tell me hit's name.	8.355842287779252
5113. it is sowbelly with tits on.	5.873210788171047
5114. it is salt po'k and skippers.	8.060072509660966
5115. that po'k it was so full of	skippers it would jump and run and not come when you say 'hoo-pig'.	3.8408975680933235
5116. had to put my foot on it to hole it down while i cut it up fer	the lob-scuse.	5.367751211575916
5117. he dumped the pan of crumbled hardtack into	the boiling pot of lobscouse.	4.191792515969988
5118. good ole lob-scuse he mumbled	and stirred the pot.	7.113164002954137
5119. he stopped stirring and looked over his shoulder.	4.861904554845803
5120. know what ole buckra et tonight?	7.287046741754659
5121.  he demanded.	8.80323508231408
5122. know what	i had to fix fer ole him?	6.512433464386664
5123.    adam shook his head.	6.2862655823088245
5124. she was a child too much a part of her environment too eager to grow	and learn and experience.	6.916552460689773
5125. once they were at easthampton for the summer	.	5.47725059946345
5126. one soft evening- that marvelous sea-blessed time when the	sun's departing warmth lingers and a smell of spume and wrack haunts	everything- amy had picked herself off the floor and begun to walk.	4.750509738934518
5127. fritzie was on the couch reading; laura was sitting in an easy chair	about eight feet away.	4.155188294901505
5128. the infant in white terry-cloth bathrobe	her face intense and purposeful had essayed a few wobbly steps toward	her father.	4.653079438027171
5129. y'all wanna walk- walk he said.	5.219666477665999
5130. then gently	he shoved her behind toward laura.	7.498046420169647
5131. amy walked- making it halfway	across the cottage floor.	4.6724501027054846
5132. she lost not a second picking herself up	and continuing her pilgrimage to laura.	5.830243309177054
5133. then laura took her gently	and shoved her off again toward fritzie: amy did not laugh- this	was work concentration achievement.	3.7719376355957364
5134. in a few minutes she was making	the ten-foot hike unaided; soon she was parading around the house	flaunting her new skill.	6.009445761420646
5135. some liar's logic a wisp of optimism	as fragile as the scent of tropical blossoms that came through the	window	consoled her for a moment.	3.7721912855475175
5136. amy had to be safe had to	come back to them- if only to reap that share of life's experiences	that were her due if only to give her parents another chance to do	better by her.	4.933473147226485
5137. through the swathings of terror she jabbed deceit's	sharp point- amy would be reborn a new child with new parents	living under new circumstances.	3.7225366900371197
5138. the comfort was short-lived yet she	found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced	images on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion.	4.575113767498865
5139. gazing at her husband's drugged	body his chest rising and falling in mindless	rhythms she saw the grandeur of his fictional world that lush	garden from which he plucked flowers and herbs.	3.294585910045797
5140. she	admired him.	11.155741451300253
5141. in the darkness she saw him stirring.	5.677768222028076
5142. he seemed	to be muttering his voice surprisingly clear.	6.672854314451728
5143. y'all should	have	let me take that money out andrus said.	4.477601198394805
5144. 'nother minute	i'd have been fine.	7.712079578137997
5145. y'all	should have let me do it.	5.219666477665999
5146. yes i know fritzie.	10.409583009979668
5147. the heat intensified on tuesday.	4.979646837577486
5148. southern california gasped	and blinked under an autumn hot spell drier more enervating more	laden with man's contrived impurities than the worst days of the summer	past.	4.964185281973001
5149. it could continue this way hitting 106 and more in the valley	joe mcfeeley knew into october.	4.624412981345428
5150. he and irvin moll were sipping	coffee at the breakfast bar.	6.590753475706068
5151. both had been up since 7:00-	irv	on the early-morning watch mcfeeley unable to sleep during his four-hour	relief.	4.084538008970246
5152. the night before they had telephoned the andrus maid	selena masters and she had arrived early bursting her vigorous	presence into the silent house with an assurance that amused mcfeeley	and confounded moll.	4.596745382374803
5153. the latter thanking her for the coffee had	winked and muttered sure 'nuff honey.	4.146722930841462
5154. selena was the wrong	woman for these crudities.	6.743273855772659
5155. with a hard eye she informed moll: don't	sure 'nuff me officer.	4.927663236786041
5156. i'm honey only to my husband	understand?	7.163184125958424
5157.  sergeant moll understood.	7.073072315612038
5158. the maid was very	black and very energetic trim in a yellow pique uniform.	4.983213877598357
5159. her speech	was barren of southernisms; she was one of eliot sparling's neutralized	minorities adopting the rolling r's and constricted	vowels of los angeles.	4.068171155984357
5160. not seeing her dark intelligent face one	would have gauged the voice as that of a westwood village matron ten	years out of iowa.	5.762934328638643
5161. after she had served the detectives coffee and	toast	she settled down with a morning newspaper and began reading the stock	market quotations.	3.8600700998460824
5162. while she was thus engaged mcfeeley questioned	her about her whereabouts the previous day any recollections she	had of people hanging around of overcurious delivery boys or repairmen	of strange cars cruising the neighborhood.	4.7589400625160225
5163. she answered him precisely	missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports.	4.141506724653786
5164. selena	masters joe realized was her own woman.	6.743273855772659
5165. she was the only kind	of negro laura andrus would want around: independent unservile	probably charging double what ordinary maids did for housework- and	doubly efficient.	4.067951861227681
5166. when the parents emerged from the bedroom	a few minutes later the maid greeted them quietly.	6.095770413321086
5167. i'm awful sorry	about what's happened selena said.	4.913686410369733
5168. maybe today'll be	a good-news day.	9.062117732897656
5169. she charged off to the bedrooms.	6.1990498907137335
5170. moll	took his coffee	into the nursery.	7.712079578137997
5171. during the night a phone company technician	had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones.	4.276568777927584
5172. someone	would have to remain in the office continually.	7.006892958599043
5173. mcfeeley greeted	the parents then studied his notebook.	4.913686410369733
5174. he wanted to take the mother	to headquarters at once and start her on the mug file.	7.176333508400048
5175. andrus did not answer him.	5.619635421798327
5176. his face was	bloated with drugging redder than normal.	6.9433428400536945
5177. the woman had the glassy	look of an invalid as if she had not slept at all.	3.4704623674202635
5178. oh- we managed	she said.	8.457718703298294
5179. did anything happen during	the night?	6.451854159528076
5180.    few crank calls mcfeeley said.	9.061645555832891
5181. a	couple of tips we're running down- nothing promising.	4.6724501027054846
5182. we can	expect more of the same.	9.935559456636058
5183. too bad your number is in the directory.	6.76879163439587
5184. didn't occur to me my child would be kidnaped when i had	it listed andrus muttered.	5.2288514545018705
5185. he settled on the sofa with his coffee	warming his hands on the cup although the room was heavy with heat.	3.701511050844225
5186. the three had little to say to each other.	6.506870194488968
5187. the previous night's	horror- the absolute failure overcast with the intrusions of	the press had left them all with a wan sense of uselessness of play-acting.	3.225347076154939
5188. sipping their coffee discussing the weather the day's shopping	fritzie's commitments at the network	they avoided the radio the morning tv news show even	the front page of the santa luisa register resting on the kitchen	bar.	4.578691135557044
5189. kidnaper spurns ransom; amy still missing.	5.219666477665999
5190. once	andrus walked by it hastily scanned the bold black headline and	the five-column lead of the article	and muttered: we a buncha national celebrities.	4.758972536424235
5191. mcfeeley told the parents he would escort them to	police headquarters in a half hour.	4.129409376048355
5192. before that he wanted to talk to	the neighbors.	8.903145681144114
5193. he did not want to bring the andruses to the station	house too early- rheinholdt had summoned a press conference and he	didn't want them subjected to the reporters again.	4.107650608895582
5194. he could think	of nothing else to tell them: no assurances no hopeful hints at great	discoveries that day.	5.567528331983121
5195. when the detective left andrus phoned his	secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute	director for his current project.	3.908947122088302
5196. mrs andrus was talking to	the	maid arranging for her to come in every day instead of the four days	she now worked.	5.814209211499945
5197. outside only a handful of reporters remained.	6.338131818560583
5198. the bulk of the press corps was covering rheinholdt's conference.	6.74430602935319
5199. in contrast to the caravan of the previous night there were only	four cars parked across the street.	4.458091463039818
5200. two men he did not recognize were	sipping coffee and munching sweet rolls.	7.407911084089413
5201. he did not see sparling or	degroot or ringel or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed	him twelve hours ago.	4.354544210435606
5202. however the litter remained augmented by	several dozen lunchroom suppers.	7.418896730857626
5203. the street cleaner had not yet been	around.	4.680206600154892
5204. one of the reporters called to him: anything new	lieutenant?	7.461494218587759
5205.  and he ignored him skirting the parked cars and	walking up the path to the skopas house.	4.309120694323039
5206. when mcfeeley was halfway	to the door the proprietor emerged- a mountainous dark man his	head thick with resiny black hair his eyes like two of the black olives	he imported in boatloads.	4.956041131011058
5207. the master	of the house his nourished face unrevealing consented to postpone	his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective.	3.828930393500464
5208. inside	as soon as mr skopas had disclosed- in a hoarse whisper- the	detective's errand his family gathered in a huddle forming a mass	of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stood at one side of	a baroque fireplace.	4.375848823692559
5209. flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps they	seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait.	3.8101576301595865
5210. it was amazing how	they had herded together for protection: an enormous matriarch in	a quilted silk wrapper rising from the breakfast table; a gross boy	in his teens shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands;	a girl in her twenties fat and sullen descending the marble	staircase;	then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor.	4.345208730583422
5211. they answered him in monosyllables nods occasionally muttering	in greek to one another awaiting the word from papa who restlessly	cracked his knuckles anxious to stuff himself into his white cadillac	and burst off to the freeway.	3.468159085040232
5212. no they hadn't seen anyone around;	no they didn't know the andrus family; yes they had read	about the case; yes they had let some reporters use their phone	but they would no longer.	4.675956026858209
5213. they offered no opinions volunteered nothing	betrayed no emotions.	5.004446092747742
5214. studying them mcfeeley could not help make	comparison with the andrus couple.	5.739974350684024
5215. the skopas people seemed to him	of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy.	3.428445430010395
5216. he imagined they were the kind whose tax returns were never examined	whose children had no	unhappy romances whose names never knew scandal.	5.124326353058365
5217. the equation was	simple:	wealth brought them happiness and their united front to the world	was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had let	no one in on the secrets.	3.3006031800160818
5218. by comparison fritzie and laura andrus	were quivering fledglings.	7.142137720118236
5219. they possessed no outer fortifications no	hard shells of confidence; they had enough difficulty getting from	day to day let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them.	3.44488687744355
5220. skopas	expressed no curiosity over the case offered no expression of sympathy	made no move to escort mcfeeley to the door.	4.920292053327142
5221. all four remained	impacted on the sofa until he had left.	4.76749922033332
5222. he had spoken to mrs	emerson the previous day.	7.777994160460372
5223. there remained a family named kahler	owners of a two-story tudor-style house on the south side of the andrus	home.	4.8835536820218515
5224. their names had not come up in any discussions with laura	and he had no idea what they would be like.	5.76438261659878
5225. mcfeeley noted the immaculate	lawn and gardens: each blade of grass cropped bright and firm;	each shrub glazed with good health.	3.6950113915188205
5226. the door was answered	by a slender man in his sixties- straight-backed somewhat clerical	in manner wearing rimless glasses.	4.937875809145298
5227. when joe identified himself he	nodded unsmiling and ushered him into a sedate living room.	4.216498263466229
5228. she had a dried-out quality- a gray lean woman	not unattractive.	7.252594317671978
5229. both were dressed rather formally.	6.862532754142335
5230. the man wore	a vest and a tie the woman had on a dark green dress and three strands	of pearls.	5.155317149450493
5231. funny thing mr kahler said when they	were seated when i heard you ringing i figured it was that guy	down the block hausman.	3.5427796358052883
5232. kahler continued:	i fixed his dog the other day and i guess he's sore	so i expected him to come barging in.	4.928971853292942
5233. mr kahler went on to explain	how hausman's fox terrier had been making in his flower	beds.	4.383730544924308
5234. the dog refused to be scared off so kahler had purchased some	small firecrackers.	5.153158321962212
5235. he would lay in wait in the garage and when the	terrier came scratching around he'd let fly with a cherry bomb.	3.7648200302218915
5236. scared	the hell out of him kahler grinned.	6.743273855772659
5237. i hit him in the	ass once.	5.79847623263147
5238. both grinned at the detective.	9.037240126126274
5239. finally all i needed	was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked like a firecracker	and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life.	3.721811434768962
5240. in the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room	and then they went across the hall to the kitchen.	5.034796735286095
5241. she was intimidated	by the stove.	7.177051593838942
5242. he found the pilot light and turned on one of the burners	for her.	6.877718831550405
5243. the gas flamed up two inches high.	4.449810918582347
5244. they found the teakettle	and put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox.	5.714448876544206
5245. several sections of a loaf of dark bread; butter; jam; a tiny	cake of ice.	4.216756818901809
5246. in their search for what turned out to be the right breakfast	china but the wrong table silver they opened every cupboard door	in the kitchen and pantry.	6.070259393952529
5247. while she was settling the teacart he went	back across the hall to their bedroom opened one of the suitcases	and took out powdered coffee and sugar.	3.9894988307459642
5248. she appeared with the teacart	and he opened the windows.	6.713816465488134
5249. do you want to call eugene?	7.971009626951035
5250. 	he didn't but it was not really a question and so he	left the room walked down the hall to the front of the apartment hesitated	and then knocked lightly on the closed door of the study.	5.310056165258747
5251. le petit dejeuner harold said in	an accent that did credit to miss sloan his high-school french teacher.	3.7038746714971866
5252. at the same time his voice betrayed uncertainty about their	being here and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable peace-loving	and dependable in everybody.	5.476708008475401
5253. since ordinary breakfast-table	conversation was impossible it was at least something that they were	able to offer eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it and the	plate of bread and butter and that eugene could return the pitcher	of hot milk to them handle first.	3.2844168860775476
5254. eugene put a spoonful of powdered	coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water.	5.310836305872345
5255. stirring he	said: i am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with	you today.	3.8101576301595865
5256. they assured him that they did not expect or	need to be entertained.	7.083436497118975
5257. harold put a teaspoonful of powdered coffee	in	his cup and filled it with hot water and then stirring he sat back	in his chair.	3.689267048396555
5258. every time he moved or said something	the chair creaked again.	6.772168150407406
5259. eugene was not entirely silent	or openly rude- unless asking harold to move to another chair and	placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act	of rudeness.	3.5083726908013637
5260. it went right on creaking under his own considerable weight	and all it needed harold thought was for somebody to fling himself	back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it.	5.444371158476293
5261. through the open window they heard sounds below in the street: cartwheels	a tired horse's plodding step voices.	4.023378707948775
5262. harold indicated the	photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was	in.	5.928073964511916
5263. eugene told him and he promptly forgot.	5.525177815820235
5264. they passed the marmalade	the bread the black-market butter back and forth.	6.0639976778550295
5265. nothing was said	about hotels or train journeys.	5.584093890128675
5266. eugene offered harold his	car to use at any time he cared to and when this offer was not accepted	the armchair creaked.	5.23421717738819
5267. they all three had another cup of coffee.	5.153362819112266
5268. eugene was in his pajamas and dressing gown and on his large feet he	wore yellow turkish slippers that turned up at the toes.	5.135198313565666
5269. ex-cuse	me he said in berlitz english and got up and left them	to bathe and dress.	4.0329476289159665
5270. the first shrill ring of the telephone brought	harold out into the hall.	6.886813683030114
5271. he realized that he had no idea where	the telephone was.	5.857115385591756
5272. at that moment the bathroom door flew open and	eugene came out with his face lathered for shaving and strode down	the hall tying the sash of his dressing gown as he went.	4.8579907667070374
5273. the telephone	was in the study but the ringing came from the hall.	4.096615103921759
5274. between the telephone	and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord and when the	conversation came to an end eugene carried the instrument with him the	whole length of the apartment to his bathroom where it rang three	more times while he was shaving and in the tub.	4.853536169671591
5275. before he left the apartment	he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could	do for them.	4.37738786331781
5276. sabine called a few	minutes ago eugene said.	6.743273855772659
5277. she wants you and barbara to have	dinner with her tomorrow night.	4.516262660452241
5278. he handed harold a key to	the front door and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while	they were out of the apartment.	5.454743793784482
5279. when enough time had elapsed so	that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had	forgotten harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one	room after another.	3.623563050468429
5280. in the room next to theirs was a huge cradle of	mahogany ornately carved and decorated with gold leaf.	5.583414465685697
5281. it was the	most important-looking cradle he had ever seen.	5.472416104516476
5282. then came their bathroom	and then a bedroom that judging by the photographs on the walls	must belong to mme cestre.	5.386255000255415
5283. a young woman who looked like alix	with her two children.	4.6379872092577115
5284. alix and eugene on their wedding day.	6.83086921430693
5285. matching	photographs in oval frames of mme bonenfant and an elderly man	who must be alix's grandfather.	3.8101576301595865
5286. mme vienot considerably younger	and very different.	7.163184125958424
5287. and a gray-haired man whose	glance- direct lifelike and mildly accusing- was contradicted by	the gilt and black frame.	4.016599156084136
5288. it was the kind of frame that is only put	around the photograph of a dead person.	7.056833909714958
5289. professor cestre could it	be?	6.7182894700408395
5290.    with the metal shutters closed the dining room was so dark	that it seemed still night in there.	5.959083699239572
5291. one of the drawing-room shutters	was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and sofas which	seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet.	3.7649934250953843
5292. the curtains	were of the same material and there were some big oil paintings- portraits	in the style of lancret and boucher.	5.900545565975443
5293. though taken	individually the big rooms were or seemed to be square the apartment	as a whole formed a triangle.	4.399862925492046
5294. the apex the study where eugene slept	was light and bright and airy and cheerful.	4.900432726990401
5295. the window looked out	on the place redoute- it was the only window of the apartment that	did.	4.286219356729534
5296. looking around slowly he saw a marble fireplace a desk a low	bookcase of mahogany with criss-crossed brass wire instead of glass	panes in the doors.	4.863583238219103
5297. the daybed eugene had slept in made up now with	its dark-brown velours cover and pillows.	3.5177069743400518
5298. the portable record player	with a pile of classical records beside it.	5.187735111958531
5299. beethoven's fifth was	the one on top.	5.219666477665999
5300. da-da-da-dum h music could not be eugene's passion.	7.486267446438489
5301. besides the records were dusty.	6.813994668468896
5302. he tried the doors of the bookcase.	7.316915888669126
5303. the titles he could read easily through the criss-crossed	wires: works on theology astral physics history biology political	science.	3.456376834465079
5304. he moved over to the desk and	stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything.	5.805990122030305
5305. the clock	on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced	at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room.	3.225421653469569
5306. the concierge called out to them as they were passing through	the foyer.	6.028655830688128
5307. her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building and	her small front room was clogged with heavy furniture- a big round	oak dining table and chairs a buffet with a row of unclaimed letters	inserted between the mirror and its frame.	3.6211832348405295
5308. the suitcases had come	while they were out and had been put in their room the concierge said.	4.946823013853167
5309. he waited until they were inside the elevator and then said:	now what do we do?	4.074195952067488
5310.    call the vouillemont i	guess.	8.457718703298294
5311. rather than sit around waiting	for the suitcases to be delivered they had gone sight-seeing.	4.302876268723227
5312. they	went to the flea market expecting to find the treasures of europe	and found instead a duplication of that long double row of booths in	tours.	4.963943300842554
5313. cheap clothing and junk of every sort as far as the eye could	see.	4.769208530110984
5314. looked at everything.	9.52328749892442
5315. barbara bought	some cotton aprons and harold bought shoestrings.	4.706452923182836
5316. they had lunch	at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection of two broad busy	unpicturesque streets and coming home they got lost in the metro;	it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should	have changed in order to take the line that went to the place redoute.	5.503099457424463
5317. it was the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of	his pocket and inserted it into the keyhole.	4.871373430024727
5318. when he opened the door	there stood eugene on his way out of the apartment.	8.079503468708777
5319. he was wearing	sneakers and shorts and an open-collared shirt and in his hand he carried	a little black bag.	4.246939324039843
5320. he did not explain where he was going and	they did not ask.	8.032316892548485
5321. instead they went on down the hall to their room.	5.138591227560039
5322. do you think he could be having an affair?	9.093834565220813
5323.  barbara asked	as they heard the front door close.	4.706452923182836
5324. oh no harold	said shocked.	9.921711973122616
5325. well this is france after all.	6.260179202319753
5326. i know but there must be some other explanation.	8.296152914836425
5327. he's probably	spending the evening with friends.	5.4442596196918664
5328. and for that he needs	a little bag?	8.416489573317786
5329.    they went shopping in the neighborhood	and bought two loaves of bread with the ration coupons they had been given	in blois and some cheese and a dozen eggs and a bag of oranges	from a peddler in the place redoute- the first oranges they had	seen since they landed.	3.403523965368688
5330. they had vermouth sitting in front of a cafe.	9.800140058577114
5331. when they got home harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment	and thought how under different circumstances they might have	stayed on here in these old-fashioned high-ceilinged rooms that	reminded him of the irelands' apartment in the east eighties.	3.617026115785282
5332. they	could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days.	5.9245075971793435
5333. he	went down the hall to eugene's bathroom to turn on the hot-water	heater and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming	trunks.	4.547060614363017
5334. they were damp.	12.492419277863481
5335. he reached out and felt the	bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub.	3.907015240643649
5336. he looked	around the room and then called out: come here quick?	6.106890534153205
5337. 	what is it?	6.939425769494729
5338.  barbara asked standing in the doorway.	7.659959882912455
5339. i've	solved the mystery of the little bag.	5.737557789166974
5340. there it is h and there	is what was in it.	7.223207521588794
5341. but where do people go swimming in paris?	5.495497096521789
5342. 	that boat in the river maybe.	7.163184125958424
5343. what boat?	10.509353167850248
5344.    there's	a big boat anchored near the place de la concorde with	a swimming pool in it- didn't you notice it?	4.920292053327142
5345.  but if he has time	to go swimming he had time to be with us.	5.341934117186493
5346. she looked at	him in surprise.	8.764473609234177
5347. i know he said reading her mind.	6.088225202532881
5348. i don't know what i'm going to do with you.	8.161896677798026
5349. it's	because we are in france he said and know so few people.	5.047247324929657
5350. so something like this matters more than it would at home.	6.593194377062752
5351. also	he was so nice when he was nice.	5.7245985219215685
5352. all because i didn't	feel like dancing.	8.229437522901726
5353. i don't think it was that really.	6.147128264769629
5354. then what was it?	9.786098029140714
5355.    i don't know.	8.064324642106776
5356. the tweed coat maybe.	6.996493558081793
5357. the thing about eugene is that	he's very proud.	4.501801121070935
5358. and the thing about hurt feelings the	wet bathing suit pointed out is that the person who has them is not quite	the innocent party he believes himself to be.	5.27911710447163
5359. for instance- what	about all those people harold rhodes went toward unhesitatingly	as if this were the one moment they would ever have together their one	chance of knowing each other?	3.414423276640401
5360.    fortunately the embarrassing	questions raised by objects do not need to be answered or we would	all have to go sleep in the open fields.	5.7673845900966505
5361. and in any case answers may	clarify but they do not change anything.	6.680256879113744
5362. h he brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes of about a hundred	pounds' weight.	6.242316666326003
5363. they took jesus's body then and wrapped it	in winding-clothes with the spices; that is how the jews prepare a	body for burial.	3.6202216876943454
5364. listed as present at the descent were mary	mary's sister mary magdalene john joseph of arimathea nicodemus.	5.288745572760607
5365. search as he might he could find no place where the bible	spoke of a moment when mary could have been alone with jesus.	3.964609673782609
5366. mostly	the scene was crowded with mourners such as the dramatic dell'arca	lamentation in bologna where the grief-stricken spectators had	usurped mary's last poignant moment.	5.16203315077217
5367. in his concept there could	be no one else present.	5.318631449287582
5368. his first desire was to create a	mother and son alone in the universe.	5.978284557867585
5369. when might mary have had that	moment to hold her child on her lap?	4.3298745893348745
5370.  perhaps after the soldiers had	laid him on the ground while joseph of arimathea was at pontius pilate's	asking for christ's body nicodemus was gathering his mixture	of myrrh and aloes and the others had gone home to mourn.	4.974664235244041
5371. those	who saw his finished pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses.	4.751399569400757
5372. they would feel what mary was undergoing.	8.286149949864244
5373. there would be no	halos no angels.	8.243606536213317
5374. these would be two human beings whom god had chosen.	7.119084470537819
5375. he felt close to mary having spent so long concentrating	on the beginning of her journey.	4.632534870171517
5376. now she was intensely alive anguished;	her son was dead.	6.861471697908582
5377. even though he would later be resurrected	he was at this moment dead indeed the expression on his face reflecting	what he had gone through on the cross.	3.908890917273711
5378. in his sculpture therefore	it would not be possible for him to project anything of what jesus felt	for his mother; only what mary felt for her son.	5.536318166613681
5379. jesus' inert	body would be passive his eyes closed.	4.6724501027054846
5380. mary would have to carry the	human communication.	9.373694277756233
5381. this seemed right to him.	5.840583368462051
5382. it was a relief	to shift in his mind to technical problems.	7.313947858328772
5383. since his christ was	to be life size how was mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship	seeming ungainly?	3.780620703135079
5384.  his mary would be slender of limb and	delicate of proportion yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely	and convincingly as she would a child.	4.717600277427974
5385. there was only one	way to accomplish this: by design by drawing diagrams and sketches	in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas	to carry his concept.	3.6017751336670845
5386. he started by making free sketches to loosen	up his thinking so that images would appear on paper.	5.173170914227126
5387. visually	these approximated what he was feeling within himself.	4.6724501027054846
5388. at the same time	he started walking the streets peering at the people passing or shopping	at the stalls storing up fresh impressions of what they looked	like how they moved.	5.445998791627569
5389. in particular he sought the gentle sweet-faced	nuns with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads	remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them	down on paper.	3.7078244690997146
5390. discovering that draperies could be designed	to serve structural purposes he began a study of the anatomy of folds.	5.576761381664318
5391. he improvised as he went along completing a life-size clay figure	then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper wet the	lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that argiento	brought from the bank of the tiber to the consistency of thick	mud.	3.159587266471059
5392. no fold could be accidental each turn of the drapery had to serve	organically to cover the madonna's slender legs and feet so that	they would give substantive support to christ's body to intensify	her inner turmoil.	4.884433119969613
5393. when the cloth dried and stiffened he saw what	adjustments had to be made.	5.213142185097693
5394. so that's sculpture commented	argiento wryly when he had sluiced down the floor for a week making	mud pies.	6.389012079411318
5395. see argiento	if you control the way these folds are bunched like this or made to	flow you can enrich the body attitudes.	3.7213634813321868
5396. they can have as much tactile	appeal as flesh and bone.	7.1534086977750935
5397. he went into the jewish quarter	wanting to draw hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding	of how christ might have looked.	4.370589345517333
5398. the jewish section was	in trastevere near the tiber at the church of san francesco a ripa.	6.056201630771685
5399. the colony had been small until the spanish inquisition of 1492	drove many jews into rome.	3.6029147364136227
5400. here for the most part they were well	treated as a reminder of the old testament heritage of christianity;	many of their gifted members were prominent in the vatican	as physicians musicians bankers.	5.773640929126171
5401. the men did not object to	his sketching them while they went about their work but no one could	be persuaded to come to his studio to pose.	3.657393101721431
5402. he was told to ask for	rabbi melzi at the synagogue on saturday afternoon.	6.034824734397721
5403. michelangelo found	the rabbi in the room of study a gentle old man with a white beard	and luminous grey eyes robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on	his head.	3.6601968480537086
5404. he was reading from the talmud with a group of men from his	congregation.	7.413199841051958
5405. when michelangelo explained why he had come rabbi	melzi replied gravely:   the bible forbids us to bow down	to or to make graven images.	3.905320028021383
5406. that is why our creative people give their	time to literature not to painting or sculpture.	6.2094796983187495
5407. but	rabbi melzi you don't object to others creating works of art?	4.182602481535312
5408. 	not at all.	9.52328749892442
5409. each religion has its own tenets.	6.264552074650091
5410. i am carving a pieta from white carrara marble.	7.203140468278214
5411. i wish to make	jesus an authentic jew.	5.838724928587967
5412. i cannot accomplish this if you will not	help me.	7.638020034730839
5413. the rabbi said thoughtfully i would not want	my people to get in trouble with the church.	3.569866964688717
5414. i am working	for the cardinal of san dionigi.	7.6167945054926784
5415. i'm sure he would approve.	5.9907060216670445
5416. what kind of models would you prefer?	8.849646891277528
5417.    workmen.	10.144513917544229
5418. not bulky laborers but sinewy men.	8.567099704531786
5419. rabbi melzi smiled at	him with infinitely old but merry eyes.	4.317068102383446
5420. i will send you the best the quarter has to offer.	6.552528416857909
5421. michelangelo	hurried to sangallo's solitary bachelor room with his sketches	asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the	seated madonna.	3.542415248362911
5422. sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle	couch.	6.412214371980113
5423. michelangelo bought some scrap lumber.	5.685809527696587
5424. together he and argiento	built the stand covering it with blankets.	6.378172968998682
5425. his first	model arrived at dusk.	5.949600585200961
5426. he hesitated for a moment when michelangelo asked	him to disrobe so michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to	wrap around his loins led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes.	5.731012250677504
5427. he then draped him over the rough stand explained that he was supposed	to be recently dead and was being held on his mother's lap.	4.044995799006079
5428. the	model quite plainly thought michelangelo crazy; only the instructions	from his rabbi kept him from bolting.	5.2288514545018705
5429. but at the end of the sitting	when michelangelo showed him the quick free drawings with the	mother roughed in holding her son the model grasped what michelangelo	was after and promised to speak to his friends h.	3.8611855481617074
5430. he worked for	two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi.	5.979753062737966
5431. mary presented	quite a different problem.	6.231182398766929
5432. though this sculpture must take place	thirty-three	years after her moment of decision he could not conceive	of her as a woman in her mid-fifties old wrinkled broken in body and	face by labor or worry.	4.941505477666565
5433. his image of the virgin had always been that	of a young woman even as had his memory of his mother.	3.9216965091252964
5434. jacopo	galli introduced him into several roman homes.	6.743273855772659
5435. here he sketched	sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk young girls not yet	twenty some about to be married some married a year or two.	3.929984489139499
5436. since	the santo spirito hospital had taken only men he had had no experience	in the study of female anatomy; but he had sketched the women of	tuscany in their fields and homes.	5.326827170945156
5437. he was able to discern the body	lines of the roman women under their robes.	4.81331731812323
5438. he spent concentrated	weeks putting his two figures together: a mary who would be young	and sensitive yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap; and	a jesus who though lean was strong even in death h a look he remembered	well from his experience in the dead room of santo spirito.	4.4449845828805845
5439. he drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory	without need to consult his sketches.	3.834693659301933
5440. soon he was ready	to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay.	6.7107549487149125
5441. here he would have free	expression because the material could be moved to distort forms.	5.037663331094838
5442. when	he wanted to emphasize or get greater intensity he added or subtracted	clay.	5.620115935004308
5443. next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of	wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence.	4.451702872215587
5444. he respected each	of these approach techniques and kept them in character: his quill	drawings had a scratchiness suggesting skin texture; the clay he used	plastically to suggest soft moving flesh as in an abdomen in a reclining	torso; the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an	elastic pull.	4.3586959030584
5445. yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his	mind; they remained rough starting points.	4.111991809393223
5446. when carving he was charged	with spontaneous energy; too careful or detailed studies in clay	and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model.	5.041552017062101
5447. the true surge had to be inside the marble itself.	4.639147417844129
5448. drawing and	models were his thinking.	7.712079578137997
5449. the arrangement	with argiento was working well except that sometimes michelangelo	could not figure who was master and who apprentice.	3.390604280653994
5450. argiento had	been trained so rigorously by the jesuits that michelangelo was unable	to change his habits: up before dawn to scrub the floors whether	they were dirty or not; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry	every day the pots scoured with river sand after each meal.	4.220979431796899
5451. argiento this is senseless he complained not liking to work	on the wet floors particularly in cold weather.	3.685338251241182
5452. scrub the studio once a week.	7.163184125958424
5453. before dawn.	11.063039017693791
5454. and god help anyone who tries to unteach you!	grumbled michelangelo; yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble	about for argiento made few demands on him.	5.715897297301465
5455. the boy was becoming acquainted	with the contadini families that brought produce into rome.	3.7352642861954495
5456. on sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with	them and in particular to see their horses.	5.534810446545703
5457. the one thing he missed	from his farm in the po valley was the animals; frequently he would	take his leave of michelangelo by announcing:   today	i go see the horses.	3.374525281337151
5458. it took a piece of bad luck to show	michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him.	6.977372817382238
5459. he was crouched over his	anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim when a splinter	of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil.	3.529795506072776
5460. he stumbled	into the house eyes burning like fire.	6.672854314451728
5461. argiento made him lie	down on the bed brought a pan of hot water dipped some clean white linen	cloth and applied it to extract the splinter.	3.5082201227658256
5462. though the pain was	considerable michelangelo was not too concerned.	7.435570464477286
5463. he assumed he could	blink the splinter out.	5.277085615068132
5464. but it would not come.	13.935860852574335
5465. argiento never left	his side keeping the water boiled applying hot compresses throughout	the night.	3.9701983041559052
5466. by the second day michelangelo began to worry;	and by the second night he was in a state of panic: he could see nothing	out of the afflicted eye.	5.993862266653667
5467. at dawn argiento went to jacopo galli.	5.766658764283959
5468. galli arrived with his family surgeon maestro lippi.	6.412214371980113
5469. the surgeon	carried a cage of live pigeons.	4.280553672808819
5470. he told argiento to take a bird	out of the cage cut a large vein under its wing let the blood gush	into michelangelo's injured eye.	5.263255000693481
5471. the surgeon came back at	dusk cut the vein of a second pigeon again washed out the eye.	3.6469105604926364
5472. beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps.	5.583228874976599
5473. the thin legs twitched convulsively once then kate felt the little	body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound.	3.3253845082477778
5474. the scant	flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands.	5.650577481330174
5475. when juanita awoke kate was still rocking the dead child still	crooning in disbelief no no oh no!   they put	kate to bed and wired jonathan and sent for the young presbyterian	minister.	3.4600378524772033
5476. he sat beside kate's bed with the others throughout the	morning talking talking of god's will while kate lay staring angrily	at him.	4.930362098923982
5477. when he told her god had called the child to him she	rejected his words rebelliously.	4.390769998379908
5478. few of the neighbors came but	mrs tussle came called by tragedy.	7.18100678906051
5479. it always comes in	threes she sighed heavily.	5.675564046890362
5480. trouble never comes but in threes.	7.163184125958424
5481. they held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads	church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot.	3.730768084619552
5482. kate moved	through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment.	6.2652762607713575
5483. she would not accept the death of such a little child.	6.457122292403291
5484. god called	her to him the minister had said.	7.189074171248194
5485. god would not do that	kate thought stubbornly.	5.566565984338287

5658. along wappinger	creek in dutchess county past the white church at fishkill	past verplanck's point on the east bank of the hudson to the white	salt-crusted roads of the long island rockaways there was a watching	and an activity of preparing for something explosive to happen.	5.026293509777021

5664. the road seemed animated with a few more	wagons than usual; a carriage raising up the choking june dust	and beyond in a meadow a local militia company drilling with muskets	kentuck' rifles every kind of horse pistol old sword or cutlass.	4.413373871268121
5665. the wraith-like events of the last few days flooded david's	mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his	kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from boston.	3.5898867617637538

5672. he hoped he was free of self-deception.	7.246240919856068
5673. here he was suddenly	caught up in the delirium of a war in the spite and calumny of whigs	and tories.	4.482273995921668

5676. he knew that many were	using it for their own ends.	6.981603407025449
5677. but it did not matter.	9.05578831853349

5685. and what of that poor tarred	and feathered wretch he had seen on the road driving down from schuyler's?	4.403898867792899
5686. 	things like that would increase rather than be done away	with.	5.99996263403043

5702. he began to pack the saddlebags.	9.572328816673501
5703. and all this too shall pass	away: it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church	service when he was a boy- yes in a white church with a thin spur	steeple in the patriarchal hudson valley where a feeling of plenitude	was normal in those english-dutch manors with their well-fed squires.	3.4748053740827927
5704. burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried on	in a primitive way almost unchanged from feudal times.	4.861416487662795

5714. he had	sat beside alexander brandel at the rostrum of a congress of zionists.	5.603893504423084
5715. all of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified	ideologies and each berated the other and beat his breast for	his own approaches.	4.2191780782856485
5716. when alexander brandel rose to speak the hall	became silent.	6.9860055733433075
5717. i do not care if your beliefs take you along	a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism.	3.902130759322653
5718. we are	here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest	seeking human dignity.	5.465258511733667
5719. beyond the forest all our paths merge into	a single great highway which ends in the barren eroded hills of judea.	3.6369165723416543
5720. this is our singular goal.	10.941633805085475
5721. how we travel through the forest is for	each man's conscience.	4.875350075151633
5722. where we end our journey is always the same.	7.137618932784238
5723. we all seek the same thing through different ways- an end to this	long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses	which will continue to plague us until the star of david flies over	zion.	3.7697123132189554

5729. warsaw is my city not tel aviv.	4.913686410369733
5730. and now andrei sat on a train on the way to lublin and wondered	if he was not being punished for his lack of belief.	6.339188663391435
5731. warsaw! he	saw the smug eyes of the home army chief roman and all the	romans and	the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him.	3.7296643341519857
5732. they had let	this black hole of death in warsaw's heart exist without a cry of	protest.	6.075771768617085

5839. i'm still	a soldier in a very small way styka.	5.466857685076792
5840. it was an answer that	styka understood.	9.314147829378568
5841. grabski's shanty was beyond the bridge	over the river bystrzyca near the rail center.	3.9701983041559052
5842. grabski sat in a sweat-saturated	undershirt cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy	stillness before sundown.	5.2288514545018705
5843. he was a square brick of a man with a	moon-round face and sunken polish features.	5.4044507173292855
5844. flies swarmed around the	bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread.	5.836882157391941
5845. half of it dripped	down his chin.	6.326422389642716
5846. he washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated	belch.	6.130331029301074
5847. grabski	looked at the pair of them.	5.219666477665999
5848. he grunted a sort of yes answer.	8.469852489623184
5849. my	cousin works at the labor bureau.	5.219666477665999
5850. he can make you work papers.	8.800227908081538
5851. it will take a few days.	7.16527411701905
5852. i will get you inside the guard camp as a	member of my crew.	6.1229289420422335
5853. i don't know if i can get you into the inner camp.	4.921184063825187
5854. maybe yes maybe no but you can observe everything from the roof	of a barrack we are building.	5.570775114686176
5855. grabski slurped his way to the	bottom of the soup bowl.	5.055716907457977
5856. can't understand why the hell anyone	wants to go inside that son-of-a-bitch place.	5.771236915686777
5857. orders from	the home army.	6.162967476035402
5858. why?	13.921774766768346
5859.  nothing there but jews.	7.365584334920872
5860. well-	what about the money?	8.457718703298294
5861.    andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty	notes.	5.619635421798327
5862. grabski had never seen so much money.	7.503792598609867
5863. his broad flat	fingers petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying snatched	the bills clumsily.	4.062135885374758
5864. you	get the rest when i'm safely out of majdanek.	6.4367543537849725
5865. i ain't	taking no goddamned chances for no jew business.	4.85486375821358
5866. andrei	and styka were silent.	8.457718703298294
5867. she was getting real dramatic.	7.176057686398272
5868. i'd have been more impressed	if i hadn't remembered that she'd played hedda gabler in her	highschool dramatics course.	5.057556181613073
5869. i didn't want her back on that broken	record.	5.184855959090742
5870. nothing's free in the whole goddam world was	all i could think of to say.	5.812388808587694
5871. when i'd delivered myself of that	gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink.	4.2433299680417855
5872. i'd forgotten all about thelma and the kentucky	derby and how it was thelma's fifty dollars i was spending.	4.985333447698777
5873. it was just me and eileen getting drunk together like we used to in	the old days and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my	hands on her partly because i wanted to wring her neck because she was	so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch.	3.173297398268089
5874. drunk	or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me.	7.6672359633283405
5875. i was	crazy about her all over again.	5.406629921006237
5876. it was the call of the wild all right.	7.700056032339858
5877. that evening turned out to be hell like all the others.	5.556636997773092
5878. we	moved down broadway from ginmill to ginmill.	6.743273855772659
5879. it was the same old routine.	6.989217721774281
5880. eileen got to dancing just a little tiny dancing step to a hummed	tune that you could hardly notice and trying to pick up strange	men but each time i was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she'd	pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet	husky voice about the good times and the happiness we'd had together	and there i was back on the hook.	4.359876195705239
5881. i did have the decency to	call up thelma and tell her i'd met old friends and would be home	late.	3.750269417273718
5882. i could scratch her eyes out eileen cried and stamped	her foot when i came back from the phone booth.	5.82579795498246
5883. you know i	don't like my men to have other women.	5.547626275393197
5884. i hate it.	11.28017734149722
5885. she got so drunk i had to take her home.	5.212861534950896
5886. it was a walk up on	hudson street.	8.576148609905665
5887. she just about made me carry her upstairs and then	she clung to me and wouldn't let me go.	3.9126950183062235
5888. there was a man's	jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table.	6.9889399462519
5889. the place smelt of	some kind of hair lotion these pimplike characters use.	3.8257560312125056
5890. what about	ballestre?	14.422460152990045
5891.  i had to shake her to make her listen.	5.862683398261359
5892. what about him?	11.868433137946862
5893.    suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic.	5.531838416784767
5894. precious and i allow each other absolute freedom.	6.412214371980113
5895. we are	above being jealous.	7.190961661435178
5896. he's used to me bringing home strange men.	6.412214371980113
5897. i'll	just tell him you're my husband.	5.219666477665999
5898. he can't object to that.	8.132854117812016
5899. if he pokes his nose in here i'll slug	him.	5.503212804497405
5900. that really would be funny.	9.195935429839754
5901. she was still laughing when i grabbed her and started rolling	her on the bed.	4.511856473677925
5902. after all i'm made of flesh and blood.	7.9255229209987
5903. i'm	not a plaster saint.	6.162967476035402
5904. never in my life	have i felt so remorseful about anything i've done as i did about	spending that night with my own wife.	5.072168119436061
5905. eileen declared she couldn't lift her head from the pillow.	4.337015272158265
5906. she	lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling	me where to look for the coffeepot.	5.444154294527903
5907. i was stumbling in my undershirt	trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when i smelt that	sickish sweet hairtonic smell.	3.8320272094463372
5908. there was somebody else in the apartment.	9.7247882625378
5909. honest i could feel the hair stand up on the	back of my neck like a dog's that is going to get into a fight.	3.9886663503025908
5910. i	turned around with the percolator in my hand.	7.052771283368752
5911. my eyes were so bleary	i could barely see him but there he was a little smooth olivefaced	guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora.	4.0468530748063785
5912. oval face without an expression in the world.	7.073531172724301
5913. we didn't have time to speak before eileen's voice was screeching	at us from the bed.	4.520561161859269
5914. joseph maria ballestre meet francis xavier	bowman.	7.257176012962095
5915. she gave the nastiest laugh	i ever heard.	6.111069580147366
5916. and don't either of you forget that i'm not	any man's property.	6.060445440534033
5917. if you want to fight go down on the sidewalk.	6.977054001208101
5918. she was enjoying the situation.	9.849392153339307
5919. eileen	was a psychologist all right.	5.619635421798327
5920. instead of wanting to sock the poor bastard	i found myself having a fellowfeeling for him.	5.854683914790304
5921. maybe he felt the	same way.	6.870019797935031
5922. i never felt such a lowdown hound in my life.	6.892927055309158
5923. first thing	i knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and i was	handing eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a	queen among her courtiers.	4.002661498930636
5924. i couldn't face thelma after that	night.	7.95751090267089
5925. i didn't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone.	4.663220832523438
5926. i wrote her that i'd met up with eileen and that old bonds had proved	too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express.	4.850351016532065
5927. of	course i had to give her eileen's address but she never came near	us.	4.483610608917149
5928. all she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was	beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and	it was goodbye forever.	4.758647299319306
5929. she never said a word about the fifty dollars.	5.285161222356627
5930. she added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking.	7.012466344291837
5931. i	must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times.	4.468367495253593
5932. afterwards i learned that eileen had called thelma on the telephone	and made a big scene about thelma trying to take her husband	away.	4.904002966588029
5933. that finished me with thelma.	6.81546154056796
5934. trust eileen to squeeze all the	drama out of a situation.	6.9206857832282695
5935. and there i was shacked up with eileen	in that filthy fourth floor attic on hudson street.	4.28400572962054
5936. i use the	phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about	our relationship.	5.961605892607908
5937. i felt it and it ate on me all the time but i	didn't know how right i was till later.	4.088374142724468
5938. what i did know was	that precious was always around.	7.496938377323297
5939. he slept in the hall bedroom at the	head of the stairs.	4.318068015596563
5940. who do you think pays the rent?	8.639453235921792
5941.  you wouldn't	have me throw the poor boy out on the street eileen said when	i needled her about it.	4.6645559522248
5942. i said sure that was what i wanted her	to do but she paid no attention.	5.622755970570518
5943. eileen had a wonderful way of not listening	to things she didn't want to hear.	3.8988664065024397
5944. still i didn't think	she was twotiming me with precious right then.	6.42235079263583
5945. to be on the safe side	i never let eileen get out of my sight day or night.	4.6296851193923425
5946. i couldn't make out what his racket was.	6.9995046480612055
5947. i'd	thought him a pimp or procurer but he didn't seem to be.	4.221439636042329
5948. he was smooth	and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under	his selfeffacing manner.	5.812434115403224
5949. still he let eileen treat him like a valet.	5.097235785922794
5950. whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was precious	who did the work.	5.54996356431002
5951. i never could find out what his business was.	6.048628396416449
5952. he always seemed to have money in his pocket.	7.759772825725798
5953. the phone had been	disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger.	3.7956743715342522
5954. now and then he would disappear for several days.	7.98281624707975
5955. connections	was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when i put leading	questions.	3.8849121559715263
5956. oh he's just an international spy eileen would	shout with her screechy laugh.	6.04716920427224
5957. poor devil he can't have been	too happy either.	4.94211180314333
5958. he got no relief from drink because though sometimes	precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the	evening he'd leave it on the table untouched.	5.262106957848948
5959. when i was in	liquor i rode him pretty hard i guess.	5.389933296272694
5960. occasionally if i pushed	him too far he'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel	bony skull would show through that smooth face of his.	4.889872347742842
5961. some day	i told eileen that guy will kill us both.	4.656801791137644
5962. getting drunk every night was the only way i	could handle the situation.	7.33564644183504
5963. eileen seemed to feel the same way.	4.942600426351753
5964. we still	had that much in common.	8.10408136356854
5965. the trouble was drinking cost money.	5.221956566905202
5966. the	way eileen and i were hitting it up we needed ten or fifteen dollars	an evening.	5.316114715064018
5967. eileen must have wheedled a little out of precious.	4.499885526347055
5968. i raised some kale by hocking the good clothes i had left over from	my respectable uptown life but when that was gone i didn't have a	cent.	4.851803273074929
5969. i don't know what we would have done if pat o'dwyer hadn't	come to town.	4.4954584920066605
5970. pat o'dwyer looked like a heavier jim.	7.438691843358447
5971. he had the same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he didn't have	jim's pokerfaced humor or his brains or his charm.	3.95287027509141
5972. he was a big	thick beefy violent man.	9.007206705675848
5973. now pat may have been a lecher and a plugugly	but he was a good churchgoing catholic and he loved his little	sister.	4.998765641732256
5974. those o'dwyers had that irish clannishness that made them	stick	together in spite of politics and everything.	6.435206545840228
5975. pat took eileen	and me out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears	in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again.	3.305507658629995
5976. whom god	hath joined etcetera.	8.457718703298294
5977. the o'dwyers were real religious people	except for kate.	4.1174608023645085
5978. now it would be up to me to keep the little girl	out of mischief.	7.871499821079149
5979. pat had been worried as hell ever since she'd lost	her job on that fashion magazine.	3.9184982648533015
5980. it had gone big with the hollywood	girls when he told them his sister was an editor of art and apparel.	5.6664871524795855
5981. how about me trying to help her get her job back?	4.978256845779281
5982.    all	evening eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready	for her first communion.	5.2288514545018705
5983. it just about blew us both out of the water	when eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with.	4.230422399009038
5984. but brother	i can't take a job right now she said with her eyes on her	ice cream i'm going to have a baby francis xavier's baby	my own husband's baby.	5.166878164385377
5985. my first thought was how had it	happened so soon but i counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd	been living together six weeks.	3.5628986278402532
5986. pat meanwhile was bubbling over with	sentiment.	7.163184125958424
5987. greatest thing that ever happened.	5.619635421798327
5988. now eileen really	would have to settle down to love honor and obey and she'd have to	quit drinking.	5.4149987648352385
5989. he'd come east for the christening by god he would.	4.317068102383446
5990. when we separated that evening pat pushed a hundred dollar bill	into eileen's hand to help towards a layette.	5.646256058098788
5991. before he left	town pat saw to it that i was fixed up with a job.	5.181074978795958
5992. pat had contacts	all over the labor movement.	6.743273855772659
5993. a friend of pat's named frank sposato	had just muscled into the portwatchers' union.	3.937667219405492
5994. the portwatchers	were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats	and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves.	4.653079438027171
5995. most of them were	elderly men.	8.646842765089692
5996. it was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because	the thieving is awful in the port of new york.	5.667131048951343
5997. they weren't as	well paid as they should have been.	4.770496407217191
5998. one reason the portwatchers let	sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen.	6.25517353640336
5999. sposato needed a front some labor stiff with a clean record to	act as business agent of the redhook local.	3.6442034996010606
6000. there i was a retired	wobbly and structural iron worker who'd never gouged a cent off a fellow	worker in my thirty years in the movement.	5.8684994912677455
6001. for once radicalism was	a recommendation.	6.30619630773808
6002. sposato couldn't wait to get me hired.	6.743273855772659
6003. with my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance i certainly looked	the honest working stiff.	4.239364315678497
6004. the things a man will do for a woman.	5.958078478047242
6005. there was one fact which rector could not overlook one truth which	he could not deny.	4.351767136600692
6006. as long as there were two human beings working together	on the same project there would be competition and you could no	more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave.	5.605916413158177
6007. no matter	how devoted a man was no matter how fully he gave his life to the lord	he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition	as an individual.	3.8300265653726755
6008. all of the jobs in the mission might be equal	in the eyes of the lord but they were certainly not equal in the	eyes of the lord's servants.	5.722188611023484
6009. it was only natural that fletcher would	strive for a position in which he could make the decisions.	4.956049464100007
6010. even rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he	knew it not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church-	his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career-	but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel.	4.525619157661818
6011. he	was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church	and how much was his own ego demanding to be satisfied for the two	were intertwined and could not be separated.	3.6872222699372337
6012. he wanted desperately	to see kayabashi defeated the communists in the village rooted out	the mission standing triumphant for in the triumph of the lord he	himself would be triumphant too.	5.048764067672931
6013. but perhaps this was a part of the	eternal plan that man's ambition when linked with god would be a driving	indefatigable force for good in the world.	4.370846427017348
6014. how foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith	would suffice.	7.464512508231178
6015. he would have to work without questioning the motives	which made him work and content himself with the thought that the	eventual victory however it was brought about would be sweet indeed.	4.09064487233844
6016. his first move was to send hino to the village to spend a few days.	5.610416050541989
6017. his arm had been giving him some trouble and rector was not enough	of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or	whether hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print	shop using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse.	3.239823396118676
6018. in any event rector	sent him to the local hospital to have it checked telling him to	keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find	out what kayabashi was planning.	5.930036125112794
6019. hino was elated at the prospect.	5.219666477665999
6020. he was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital	and he was given some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor-	an excellent place to make contact with the enemy.	5.523394989500544
6021. he left with all	the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday nodding attentively	as rector gave him his final instructions.	3.899924915714997
6022. he was to get involved in	no	arguments; he was to try to make no converts; he was simply to listen	and report back what he heard.	6.126578043376701
6023. it was a ridiculous situation	and rector knew it for hino frankly partisan openly gregarious	would make a poor espionage agent.	4.022369078464103
6024. if he wanted to know anything he	would end up asking about it point-blank but in this guileless manner	he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to	get them by indirection.	5.089310099827798
6025. in all of his experience in the mission field	rector had never seen a convert quite like hino.	5.125691704955966
6026. from the moment	that hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job any job-	his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise	hand- he had been ready to become a christian.	5.827406395884233
6027. he had already been	studying the bible; he knew the fundamentals and after studying	with fletcher for a time he approached rector announced that he wanted	to be baptized and that was that.	3.9837688560466056
6028. rector had never been able	to find out much about hino's past.	6.116113323942723
6029. hino talked very little about	himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration	in connection with another subject.	3.7171490053898992
6030. putting the pieces of	this mosaic together rector had the vague outlines of a biography.	5.37351654903041
6031. hino	was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast in	chiba and divided his life between the land and the sea supplementing	the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment	on a fishing boat.	3.4597655286120084
6032. without exception hino's brothers turned	to either one or both of their father's occupations but hino showed	a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach	where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller.	4.882151284010394
6033. he had gone into the japanese navy had been trained as an officer	had participated in one or two battles- he never went into detail	regarding his military experience- and at the age of twenty-five	quite as a bolt out of the blue he had walked into the mission as if	he belonged here and had become a christian.	3.911871984060557
6034. rector was often curious;	often tempted to ask questions but he never did.	5.689343482832742
6035. if and when hino	decided to tell him about his experiences he would do so unasked.	4.7198326279107405
6036. rector had no doubt that hino would come back from the village	bursting with information ready to impart it with his customary gusto	liberally embellished with his active imagnation.	4.879727390733912
6037. when the telephone	rang on the day after hino went down to the village rector had	a hunch it would be hino with some morsel of information too important	to wait until his return for there were few telephones in the village	and the phone in rector's office rarely rang unless it was important.	3.4724590490617344
6038. he was surprised to find kayabashi's secretary on the other	end of the line.	6.0356003337533615
6039. he was even more startled when he heard what kayabashi	wanted.	4.888298559738801
6040. the oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries the	secretary said businessmen from tokyo for the most part and kayabashi	wished to show them the mission.	5.434370758604125
6041. they had never seen one before	and had expressed a curiosity about it.	5.066200626399402
6042. i guess it will be all right.	9.175557763506433
6043. when would the oyabun like	to bring his guests up here?	4.796480531248612
6044.    this afternoon the	secretary said.	8.831657500921857
6045. at three o'clock if it will be of convenience to	you at that time.	5.3833640254367126
6046. i will	be expecting them.	9.808241256380496
6047. he was about to hang up the phone but	a note of hesitancy in the secretary's voice left the conversation	open.	4.2802694890648825
6048. he had something more to say.	8.845870541654653
6049. i beg to inquire if the back	is now safe for travelers he said.	4.223549308229146
6050. unless the oyabun has been working on it he said	then checked himself and added: you can tell kayabashi-san	that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for	his party to use.	5.000683812218888
6051. the secretary	sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in rector's	hand.	4.147311776706907
6052. rector had no idea why kayabashi wanted to visit the mission.	6.270240960402891
6053. for the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great	weakness or an indication of equally great confidence and from all	the available information it was probably the latter.	3.6468436226748695
6054. kayabashi must	feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this	a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the	village.	6.204734064354865
6055. at the same time it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend	a day in a christian mission out of mere curiosity.	4.473291230679811
6056. no kayabashi	was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and rector	would not be able to fathom it until they arrived.	5.631451851596767
6057. when he had	given the call a few moments thought he went into the kitchen to ask	mrs yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors using	the formal english china and the silver tea service which had been	donated to the mission then he went outside to inspect the grounds.	3.506390304686241
6058. fujimoto	had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn.	7.250916134765779
6059. rector asked	him to move it for the time being; he wanted the mission compound	to be effortlessly spotless.	4.249125973421513
6060. a good initial impression would be important	now.	7.660924477071598
6061. he went into the print shop where fletcher had just finished	cleaning the press.	4.8824028329379505
6062. how many pamphlets do we have in stock?	8.436286207070125
6063. 	rector said.	8.12896173865557
6064. i should say about a hundred thousand	fletcher said.	7.79647956474878
6065. why?	10.144513917544229
6066.    i would like to enact	a little tableau this afternoon rector said he explained about	the visit and the effect he wished to create the picture of a very busy	mission.	5.2789074911694
6067. he did not wish to deceive kayabashi exactly just to display	the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner.	4.203120570417295
6068. fletcher	nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange	the things rector requested.	6.125916852384481
6069. rector's next stop was at	the schoolroom where mavis was monitoring a test.	4.0683852436856025
6070. he beckoned to her	from the door and she slipped quietly outside.	5.925879823256658
6071. he told her of the visitors	and then of his plans.	5.126040885634619
6072. how many children do you have present	today?	8.95681448393187
6073.  he said.	8.80323508231408
6074. she looked back toward the schoolroom.	8.48954557213297
6075. no only fourteen.	8.448664152248142
6076. the little ito girl	had to go home.	6.425906140011839
6077. she has a pretty bad cold.	6.943575764960952
6078. i would	like them to appear very busy today not busy exactly but joyous exuberant	full of life.	5.45859803590467
6079. i want to create the impression of a compound	full of children.	5.348027648459181
6080. do you think you can manage it?	9.996316248645485
6081.    mavis	smiled.	10.144513917544229
6082. as rector was walking back toward	the residential hall johnson came out of the basement and bounded up	to him.	6.1638727119883985
6083. the altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen	his spirits but he was still a little wary around rector for they	had not yet discussed the incident.	3.593361693056475
6084. i think i've fixed the pump	so we won't have to worry about it for a long time he said.	7.3464302396529035
6085. i've	adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water	gets too low.	4.426200646154868
6086. he looked out over	the expanse of the compound.	6.672211275991213
6087. it was going to take a lot of activity	to fill it.	7.275503732338329
6088. have you ever operated a transit?	9.10757429012218
6089.  he said.	8.80323508231408
6090. you are about to become a	first-class surveyor rector said.	7.705533128619151
6091. when konishi gets back with	the jeep i want you to round up two or three japanese boys.	4.359145262615041
6092. you'll find an old transit in the basement.	6.56734593142743
6093. the	glass is out of it but that won't matter.	5.292957078209006
6094. it looks pretty efficient	and that's the important thing.	7.5805527892148685
6095. he went on to explain what he	had in mind.	5.94875695696579
6096. he said he could do it.	10.415774587746661
6097. rector	was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential	hall.	4.871561923976445
6098. it was rather a childish game all in all but everybody	seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not	remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much.	5.768585482711143
6099. he was	not sure what effect it would have but that was really beside the point	when you got right down to it.	4.011644719879131
6100. he was not going to lose the mission	by default and whatever reason kayabashi had for bringing his little	sight-seeing group to the mission he was going to be in for a surprise.	6.340061302429056
6101. he found elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make	sure everything was in order in the residential hall and then to take	charge of the office while the party was here.	3.6177439407159144
6102. when everything had been	done rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly	report until three o'clock.	5.499804759401998
6103. at two thirty he sent fujimoto	to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to	keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed	the approach of kayabashi's party.	3.9250297599093176
6104. then rector attired in his best	blue serge suit sat in a chair out on the lawn in the shade of a	tree smoking a cigarette and waiting.	5.187208130716919
6105. the air was cooler here and the	lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass an effect	which he found pleasant.	3.5572839382676973
6106. she concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one	be inconvenient.	6.242655734301378
6107. the fish took the bait.	4.9594814387986705
6108. he replied that he	could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with	a stranger but- joy of joys he would be at home at the hour mentioned.	4.937014394525243
6109. but when she called he had thought better of the matter	and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement.	4.2194600003412885
6110. she was told	by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged	on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed.	6.071946434534195
6111. claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff	daunt her purpose.	4.799490679679003
6112. she wrote again and now abandoning for the moment	the theme of love she asked for help in the matter of her career.	5.677286106662209
6113. she could act and she could write.	5.6935466516606885
6114. his lordship was concerned in the	management of drury lane but if there were no opportunities there	would he read and criticize her novel?	5.445645458466413
6115.    at last he consented	to meet her and following that brief interview claire wrote him a	yet more remarkable proposal:   have you any objection to the	following plan?	3.7181212934892347
6116.  on thursday evening we may go out of town together	by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles.	5.434252093749159
6117. there	we shall be free and unknown; we can return the following morning	h   she concluded by asking for a brief interview- to settle	with you where- and she threw in a tribute to his gentle	manners and the wild originality of your countenance.	3.240893892280712
6118. she opened his reply with trembling fingers h he agreed! and	he would see her that evening.	5.442661456391538
6119. victory at last!   at their	meeting he told her not to bother about where- he would attend	to that.	3.685338251241182
6120. there was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and as	claire	rose to go he asked her to sing him one song before she left.	6.577677692938252
6121. she sang him scott's charming ballad rosabelle which was the	vogue of the moment.	4.248379634311886
6122. she had never sung better.	10.021996223028511
6123. your voice	is delightful he approved with a warm smile.	4.988492008688855
6124. tomorrow will	be a new experience- i have never before made love to a nightingale	h.	5.7054231498521135
6125. there have been cooing doves chattering magpies thieving jackdaws	a proud peacock a silly goose and a harpy eagle- whom i was	silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals.	3.6006943776783027
6126. and so they went he choosing of all places an inn near medmenham	abbey scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the hellfire	club.	5.1653827366615115
6127. he regaled claire with an account of the mock mass performed	by the cassocked bloods which he had had at firsthand from old	bud dodington one of the leaders of the so-called order.	4.110259329080121
6128. each	wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this it seems was not	employed for self-flagellation h.	5.138210239895059
6129. naked girls danced in the chancel	of the abbey the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen	to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities.	3.4050350161502263
6130. the jaded	amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish.	5.610322436949331
6131. alas	all that belonged to the age of devil dashwood and wicked	wilkes abbot and beadsman of the order! the casual seduction	of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison.	3.623958174808126
6132. they passed close by the turn to bishopsgate.	7.1983552856950705
6133. a scant half mile	away shelley and mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace	the air about them scented with stock and listening to the nightingale	who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden.	3.3485172199356765
6134. charming	and peaceful- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure?	5.583228874976599
6135. 	alone with the fabulous byron! how many women had longed	for the privilege that was hers.	3.8101576301595865
6136. how was she to behave claire	wondered.	8.507244254640916
6137. to be passive to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd.	5.163410652273412
6138. she was the pursuer as clearly as was venus in shakespeare's poem.	6.681026478209081
6139. and while her adonis did not suffer from inexperience satiety might	well be an equal handicap.	4.222953381998101
6140. no she would not pretend modesty but	neither must she be crudely bold.	6.085218198508719
6141. mystery- that was the thing.	6.741655825176351
6142. in	the bedroom she would insist on darkness.	7.6312115074351405
6143. with his club foot he might	well be grateful.	5.306162718283305
6144. at the inn which was situated close to a	broad weir byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference	and addressed as milord.	5.141569642726996
6145. the place was evidently a familiar	haunt and claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated	in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown.	3.652076423278518
6146. the fire	in the sitting room was lighted.	6.060475075453244
6147. what about the bedroom?	7.472149566047476
6148. 	byron inquired.	11.155741451300253
6149. seems to me last time i was here the grate bellowed	out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell.	4.042801495538481
6150. we found some owls had built a nest in the chimney milord but	i promise you you'll never have trouble of that sort again.	5.091356926114713
6151. so not only had he been here before but it seemed he might well	come again.	4.117138012383806
6152. claire felt suddenly small and cheap heroine of a trivial	episode in the voluminous history of don juan.	5.191402541566578
6153. a cold supper	was ordered and a bottle of port.	4.429903115109044
6154. when napoleon's ship had borne	him to elba french wines had started to cross the channel the first	shipments in a dozen war-ridden years but the supplies had not yet	reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the spanish peninsula	still ruled.	4.554322792714633
6155. as they waited for supper they sat by the	fire glasses in hand while byron philosophized as much for his own	entertainment as hers.	3.789401858070251
6156. sex is overpriced he said.	7.712079578137997
6157. the	great greek tragedies are concerned with man against fate not	man against man for the prize of a woman's body.	3.9389658092366
6158. so don't see yourself	as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major	importance.	5.530720713862902
6159. the gods seemed to think sex pretty important	she rebutted.	3.9843222565600884
6160. mars and venus bacchus and ariadne jupiter	and io byron and the nymph of the owl's nest.	5.138210239895059
6161. that would be	minerva i suppose.	7.112668552315488
6162. wasn't the owl her symbol?	7.712079578137997
6163.    byron	laughed.	10.144513917544229
6164. so you know something of the classics do you?	8.382763998886944
6165. 	tell me about minerva how she behaved what she did to please	you.	4.0683852436856025
6166. i don't ask you who 'tis	you're being unfaithful to husband or lover.	5.9625205134376795
6167. for a moment she thought of answering with the truth	but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity who demanded	some	degree of education in body as well as mind.	4.100342441823909
6168. very well	she said i'll not catechize you.	7.6627252966076345
6169. what matter the others so long	as i have my place in history.	4.479710107422397
6170. she was striking the right	note.	9.849392153339307
6171. no man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed with	one so favored flattery could hardly seem overdone.	3.893208392814715
6172. brains and beauty	high position in both the social and intellectual worlds athlete	fabled lover- if ever the world was any man's oyster it was his.	5.2061558201958515
6173. the light supper over claire went to him and slipping an arm	about his shoulder sat on his knee.	3.6410859046880786
6174. he drew her close and hand on	cheek turned her face to his.	5.752586250134144
6175. her lips moist and parted spoke his	name.	5.568027332225555
6176. byron!   his hand went to her shoulder and	pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown;	then to better purpose he took hold of the knot and with dextrous	fingers untied it.	4.505044715580411
6177. the bodice beneath was buttoned and withdrawing	his lips from hers he set her upright on his knee and started to	undo it unhurriedly as if she were a child.	3.2353511403224586
6178. but kindled by	his kiss his caressing hand her desire was aflame.	6.110193592166714
6179. she sprang up and	went swiftly to the bedroom.	5.142927756812074
6180. lord byron poured himself another glass	of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color.	5.443868016901024
6181. he drank slowly with due appreciation.	5.475289483739853
6182. it was an excellent vintage.	10.823657608744451
6183. he rose and went to the bedroom.	6.144836073916031
6184. pausing in the doorway he said:	the form of the human female unlike her mind and her spirit	is the most challenging loveliness in all nature.	5.009598558075846
6185. when claire	returned to bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become	byron's mistress.	4.448126594945135
6186. by odd coincidence on the evening of her return	shelley chose to read parisina which was the latest of the titled	poet's successes.	5.6247589153641435
6187. as he declaimed the sonorous measures it was	as much as claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with	her dramatic tidings.	3.843185750653337
6188. although it is not the best of which	he is capable said shelley as he closed the book it is still	poetry of a high order.	6.680209351740099
6189. if he would only leave the east	said mary.	6.113824498399827
6190. i am tired of sultans and scimitars.	8.136389845597762
6191. the hero of his next poem is napoleon bonaparte said claire	with slightly overdone carelessness.	3.644507729554974
6192. how do you know that?	10.041551663597701
6193. 	demanded mary.	8.12896173865557
6194. i was told it on good authority	claire answered darkly.	7.774863276085242
6195. i mustn't tell i mustn't tell	she repeated to herself.	4.85486375821358

6198. william he was called in honor of the man who was at once	shelley's pensioner and his most bitter detractor.	7.398587112261805
6199. with a pardonable	irony shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his	daughter:   fanny and mrs godwin will probably be glad	to hear that mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement	and that her child is well.	3.4765293059473663
6200. at the same time another	child- this one of shelley's brain- was given to the world:	alastor a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze	into the still depths of a fine mind's musings.	5.667753553208671
6201. alastor was published	only to be savagely attacked contemptuously ignored.	4.477601198394805
6202. shelley	sent a copy to southey a former friend and another to godwin.	5.583228874976599
6203. only mary's praise sustained him	in his disappointment.	5.7703422352197045
6204. not a thought nor	a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation.	6.6023284183535145

6207. a public of one	mary echoed reprovingly.	5.146397603653904
6208. how can you say such a thing?	9.102029274006727
6209.  there	will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of alastor.	4.238323105292615
6210. there	are some even now.	9.181684080405736
6211. what about that dear clever mr thynne?	5.6525957994430716
6212. 	i am sure he is in raptures.	7.52113974000159
6213. poor mr thynne he	always has to be trotted out for my encouragement.	4.8744323834254315
6214. there	are other mr thynnes.	9.181684080405736
6215. not everyone is bewitched by byron's	caliphs and harem beauties.	5.1384951827592635
6216. mary's supercritical attitude	toward byron had nothing to do with his moral disrepute.	6.998490706775551
6217. she was resentful	of his easy success as compared with shelley's failure.	5.01265073496193
6218. the	same	month that alastor was published murray sold twenty thousand	copies of the siege of corinth a slovenly bit of byronism that	even shelley's generosity rebelled at.	4.67288338831304
6219. the lordly poet was	at low-water mark.	4.484814815711922
6220. the careless writing was in keeping with his mood	of savage discontent.	5.311405838325478
6221. on all sides doors were being slammed in his	face.	5.157783360776324
6222. the previous scandals gaily diverting as they were had only	served to increase his popularity.	5.389336945138292
6223. now under the impact of his wife's	disclosures he was brought suddenly to the realization that there	was a limit to tolerance however brilliant however far-famed the offender	might be.	3.7462317119318893
6224. he tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion	to his half sister but he soon saw as did she that this course if persisted	in would involve them in a common ruin.	4.889635027570453
6225. for the moment there	was no woman in his life and it was this vacuum that had given claire	her opportunity.	4.857126300117745
6226. but the liaison successfully started in the	last days of autumn was now languishing.	6.110203168530862
6227. byron since the separation	from his wife had been living in a smallish house in piccadilly terrace.	3.9723994098356377
6228. he refused to bring claire to it even as an occasional visitor	claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the milbankes.	4.798359079296209
6229. beckworth handed the pass to the colonel.	4.913686410369733
6230. he had thought that	the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction	of serving his own order but the slip of paper was folded and absently	thrust into the colonel's belt.	4.680603992948657
6231. despite his yearning the colonel	would not go down to see the men come through the lines.	4.649876544511476
6232. he would	remain in the tent waiting impatiently occupied by some trivial	task.	5.925879823256658
6233. sir?	10.144513917544229
6234.    -fetch me the	copies of everything b and c companies have requisitioned in the	last	six months.	5.331440467598945
6235. the last six months sir?	5.853077964889741
6236.    -you	heard me.	11.155741451300253
6237. there's a lot of waste going on here.	6.005689417604258
6238. i want to take a look.	10.875742548812378
6239. this is no damned holiday beckworth.	7.078805359811355
6240. below	he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank.	6.844037572134675
6241. the colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs methodically	tearing at his thumbnail.	4.252433392463554
6242. the bombproof was	a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth.	5.187735111958531
6243. it	stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank.	5.082529180433031
6244. from the outside it	seemed no more than a low drumlin a lump on the dark earth.	7.494732151505474
6245. a crude	ladder ran down to a wooden floor.	5.2740698705893125
6246. two slits enabled observers to watch	across the river.	7.262113886298175
6247. the place smelled strongly of rank fertile earth	rotting wood and urine.	3.9170712567438906
6248. the plank floor was slimed beneath watson's	boots.	5.8743971957932475
6249. at least the union officer had been decent enough to provide	a candle.	5.259747555353573
6250. there was no place to sit but watson walked slowly	from the ladder to the window slits and back stooping slightly to avoid	striking his head on the heavy beams.	5.3586307644485425
6251. in the corner was the soldier	with the white flag.	4.892760271004599
6252. he stood stiffly erect clutching the staff his	body half hidden by the limp cloth.	5.474600110818012
6253. watson hardly looked at him.	5.619635421798327
6254. the	man had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last	instant brandishing the flag of truce.	5.163562871090867
6255. someone had hauled him over	the side and he had remained silent while they crossed.	4.252250531179883
6256. an officer	with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank.	6.105246310244752
6257. the men in the	boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer two	of them calling him billy.	3.922213165348198
6258. when the boat had touched the weaker ones	and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the	soldiers.	5.253737957270001
6259. watson had presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof.	5.042571519122613
6260. the officer had told him that both lists must be checked.	5.1876391344755595
6261. watson	had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass.	4.826269483569942
6262. the officer surprised	said he would have to see.	7.94833980823161
6263. watson had nodded absently and muttered	that he would check the lists himself later.	3.9701983041559052
6264. he had peered through	the darkness at the rampart.	7.6448696889405445
6265. the men he would take back across	the river stood there but he turned away from them.	3.8080928101574183
6266. he wanted no part	of the emotions of the exchange no memory of the joy and gratitude	that other men felt.	5.5513344110785905
6267. he had hoped to be alone in the bombproof but the	soldier had followed him.	4.508717397685907
6268. though watson carefully ignored the man	he could not deny his presence.	6.576462500969161
6269. perhaps it would be better to speak	to him since silence could not exorcise his form.	5.050262922595216
6270. watson glanced briefly	at him seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner.	5.331440467598945
6271. we won't be too long.	6.445566847172575
6272. if my pass is approved i may	be a half hour.	6.592188902906361
6273. the soldier answered in a curious muffled voice	his lips barely moving.	3.78019698820429
6274. watson turned away and did not see the man's	knees buckle and his body sag.	5.665653037115467
6275. he	had acknowledged the man.	6.2581441840207175
6276. it was easier to think now watson decided.	7.251726844419799
6277. the stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts.	3.78019698820429
6278. he	paced slowly stooping staring at the damp slippery floor.	6.144814417540349
6279. he tried	to order the words of the three union officers seeking to create some	coherent portrait of the dead boy.	4.463457528203406
6280. his lack	of success steadily eroded his interest.	7.065535338067961
6281. he stopped pacing leaned	against the dank timbered wall and let his mind drift.	4.08316536539667
6282. a feeling of	futility an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known	seeped through him.	5.302290557898717
6283. what in the name of god was he doing crouched	in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river?	4.584947496196786
6284.  why had he crossed	the dark water to bring back a group of reclaimed soldiers or	to skulk in a foul-smelling hole?	5.999817749919615
6285.    he grew annoyed and at the	same time surprised at that emotion.	4.57977517042466
6286. he was conscious of a growing sense	of absurdity.	7.698566009378891
6287. hillman had written it all out hadn't he?	4.6724501027054846
6288.  wasn't	the report official enough?	8.457718703298294
6289.  what did he hope to accomplish here?	5.751852759601813
6290. 	hillman had ordered him not to leave the far bank.	7.108119951061968
6291. prompted by	a guilty urge he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected.	4.924513438716885
6292. for	what?	13.921774766768346
6293.  to tell john something he would find out for himself.	4.841087405640257
6294. the figure in the corner belched loudly a deep liquid eruption.	5.187671123813217
6295. watson	snorted and then laughed aloud.	5.619635421798327
6296. exactly!   the soldier's	voice was muffled again stricken with chagrin.	6.144814417540349
6297. he clutched the	staff	and his dark eyes blinked apologetically.	4.862373123883983
6298. let's get out of here.	8.82598151582089
6299. watson ran up the ladder	and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud	and river weeds.	3.8126315593722913
6300. to his left the two skiffs dented their sharp bows	into the soft bank.	5.974935307722268
6301. the flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull	of the current.	3.873635296338494
6302. a soldier held the end of a frayed rope.	8.17602221679846
6303. three	union guards appeared carrying their rifles at ready.	4.6724501027054846
6304. watson stared	at them	curiously.	9.52328749892442
6305. they were stocky men well fed and clean-shaven with	neat uniforms and sturdy boots.	4.439587769187752
6306. behind them shambled a long column of	weak tattered men.	6.472550792320018
6307. the thin gray figures raised a hoarse cawing cry	like the call of a bird flock.	3.5177069743400518
6308. they moved toward the skiffs with shocking	eagerness elbowing and shoving.	6.283546605557298
6309. four men were knocked down but	did not attempt to rise.	4.782197536532315
6310. they crept down the muddy slope toward the	waiting boats.	6.546767745283227
6311. the union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy	indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs.	3.632723372255318
6312. the crawling men tried to rise and fell again.	5.4678654398730995
6313. no one moved to them.	7.383717854936301
6314. watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened	to their voices beg shrilly.	5.478379342933174
6315. in a confused soaked and stumbling	shift of bodies and lifting arms the two men were dragged into the	same skiff.	3.9920487464276397
6316. the third crawling man forced himself erect.	6.702327581728544
6317. he swayed	like a drunkard his arms milling in slow circles.	4.467047448170571
6318. he paced forward unsteadily	leaning too far back his head tilted oddly.	5.925879823256658
6319. his steps were	short and stiff and with his head thrown back his progress was a	supercilious strut.	4.0465104716507785
6320. he appeared to be peering haughtily down his nose	at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom.	5.39738245036411
6321. he	stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed	barge his weight nearly swamping the craft.	4.483986230967085
6322. watson looked for	the fourth man.	7.712079578137997
6323. he had reached the three passive guards; he crept	in an incertain manner patting the ground before him.	4.111360403605852
6324. the guards did	not look at him.	6.154713990487742
6325. the figure on the earth halted seemingly bewildered.	4.117397318910689
6326. he sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound.	6.129098403872843
6327. then he began	to crawl again.	7.362098187794373
6328. watson watched the creeping figure.	7.712079578137997
6329. he felt a spectator	interest.	7.635203376651728
6330. would the man make it or not?	8.299459340158974
6331.  if only there was a	clock for him to crawl against.	5.67750192286037
6332. if he failed to reach the riverbank	in five minutes say then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping	in the mud.	5.578415492381582
6333. say three minutes to make it sporting.	5.97942373952918
6334. still the guards	did not move but stood inert aloof from the slow-scrambling man.	6.184366402348018
6335. the figure halted and watson gasped.	4.484731839010815
6336. the man began to creep in	the wrong direction deceived by a slight rise in the ground! he turned	slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart.	4.850659740951032
6337. watson	raced for him his boots slamming the soft earth.	4.477601198394805
6338. the guards	came to life with astonishing menace.	5.8743971957932475
6339. they spun and flung their rifles	up.	5.667824126156082
6340. one man dropped to his knee for	better aim.	7.779444404616331
6341. let me help him for the love of god!	the guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at watson	with sullen puzzled faces.	4.001698115013918
6342. watson pounded to the crawling man and	stopped panting heavily.	6.144814417540349
6343. he reached down and closed his fingers on	the man's upper arm.	4.317735119305145
6344. beneath his clutch a flat strip of muscle surged	on the bone.	6.011549501643109
6345. watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet.	4.479741376000184
6346. watson stared into a cadaverous face.	7.163184125958424
6347. two clotted balls the color	of mucus rolled between fiery lids.	4.803101628159389
6348. light sticks of fingers the tips	gummy with dark earth patted at watson's throat.	5.690711362492887
6349. the man's voice	was a sweet patient whisper.	4.280553672808819
6350. henry said that he'd take	my arm and get me right there.	6.206941031016382
6351. it don't matter.	8.703570778666487
6352. is it far?	14.33037159578475
6353.    how far could	it be watson thought bleakly how far can a blind man crawl?	4.516257245633114
6354.  another	body length or all the rest of his nighted life?	7.698684049891407
6355.    -not	far.	10.144513917544229
6356. not like us fellas.	10.576974469238069
6357. it raises the voice	bein in camp.	6.116521480984403
6358. can	you walk?	11.155741451300253
6359.    -why course i can.	6.162967476035402
6360. i can walk real good.	10.024119005393098
6361. watson stumbled down the bank.	5.619635421798327
6362. the man leaned his frail body	against watson's shoulder.	6.798226036083877
6363. he was no heavier than a child.	6.0179464822140485
6364. the man wheezed weakly his fetid breath beating	softly against watson's neck.	6.01478358151694
6365. his sweet whisper came after great effort.	5.148511793411897
6366. i wish you was henry h.	8.471223330364651
6367. he promised	to take me.	6.542523493842157
6368. watson	supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure	over the bow of the nearest skiff.	5.583155938981402
6369. the man swayed on a thwart turning	his ruined eyes from side to side.	4.137450731388251
6370. watson turned away sickened for	the first time in many months.	6.689502544830182
6371. he heard the patient voice calling.	5.738943056487959
6372. henry?	13.921774766768346
6373.  where are you henry?	7.694358264547413
6374.    -make him lie	down!   watson snatched a deep breath.	6.412214371980113
6375. he had not meant to shout.	6.784404675976464
6376. he stood with his back to the skiff.	8.051303647058907
6377. the men mewed and scratched	begging to be taken away.	5.292742365651819

6404.  as i say i wouldn't want to	begin a day like this but i often wonder what the dead would have done.	5.30610516736069

6491. i've seen you walking your dogs on sunday and driving by	in the convertible h.	3.923875656123045
6492. the thought of this lonely woman sitting	at her window touched him although he was even more touched by	her plumpness.	4.889078556612747
6493. sheer plumpness he knew is not a vital part of the	body and has no procreative functions.	4.302078017624123
6494. it serves merely as an excess	cushion for the rest of the carcass.	7.282771893961388
6495. and knowing its humble place in	the scale of things why did he at this time of life seem almost ready	to sell his soul for plumpness?	3.8083894977350026
6496.  the remarks she made about the sufferings	of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he didn't	know what to make of them but after the sixth drink he put his arm around	her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook	there.	4.157377031737648
6497. i've never done this before she said later	when he was arranging himself to leave.	3.8849121559715263
6498. her voice shook with feeling	and he thought it lovely.	7.4237334631768155
6499. he didn't doubt her truthfulness although	he had heard the words a hundred times.	4.083443138568456
6500. i've never done this	before they always said shaking their dresses down over their white	shoulders.	5.331440467598945
6501. i've never done this before they always said	waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor.	3.90243705936679
6502. i've never done	this before they always said pouring another whiskey.	5.9245075971793435
6503. i've	never done this before they always said putting on their stockings.	4.182602481535312
6504. on ships at sea on railroad trains in summer hotels with mountain views	they always said i've never done this before.	5.282405723807656
6505. where	have you been?	6.939425769494729
6506.  mrs pastern asked sadly when he came	in.	7.4670425242070335

6510. throw a little nuclear hardware at them! show	them who's boss! but in bed he had trouble sleeping.	5.057556181613073
6511. he thought	first of his son and daughter away at college.	4.467047448170571
6512. it was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known.	10.693641337538397
6513. then he	played nine imaginary holes of golf choosing his handicap his irons	his stance his opponents and his weather in detail but the green of	the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries.	3.492307346563012
6514. his money	was tied up in a nassau hotel an ohio pottery works and a detergent	for window-washing and luck had been running against him.	5.100095028032002
6515. his	worries harried him up out of bed and he lighted a cigarette and went	to the window.	4.148316393653157
6516. in the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their	leaves.	6.987520695359365
6517. during the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses	at the track and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel	tickets would still be lying like leaves in the gutters near belmont	and saratoga.	3.782755834682116
6518. maple and ash beech and elm one hundred to win on	three in the fourth fifty to win on six in the third one hundred	to win on two in the eighth.	4.915559965863862
6519. children walking home from school would	scuff through what seemed to be his foliage.	4.782052129942572
6520. then getting back into	bed he thought unashamedly of mrs flannagan planning where they	would next meet and what they would do.	5.103658473830265
6521. there are he thought so few	true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the	medicine even when the medicine seemed as it did a little crude?	3.688781009702027
6522. 	it was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been	to see her for ten years not since their last journey eastward to witness	their uncle izaak being lowered into the rocky soil; that aside	from due notification of certain major events in their lives	christmas and easter cards of the	traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through	the widowed years.	4.327225595538287
6523. her thoughts were not discrete.	6.54737746395194
6524. but there was	a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons.	6.722636311086658
6525. she	grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright like a bird	alert for flight.	3.8101576301595865
6526. she turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the	dainty-legged escritoire warped and cracked now from fifty years in	an atmosphere of sea spray.	4.979888148706494
6527. there she extracted two limp vellum sheets	and wrote off the letters one to abel one to mark.	4.140653462139415
6528. once	her trembling hand with the pen grasped tight in it was pressed against	the paper the words came sharply smoothly as authoritatively as	they would dropping from her own lips.	4.53629749905402
6529. and the stiffly regal look of	them she saw grimly lacked the quaver of age which thwarting the efforts	of her amazing will ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged	string.	3.477816071146393
6530. please come down as soon as you conveniently can	the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen i have an	important matter to discuss with you.	5.069989857813952
6531. to abel: i am afraid	there is not much to amuse small children here.	4.342621862651322
6532. i should be obliged	if you could make other arrangements for your daughters.	6.229075652796022
6533. you may stay	as long as you wish of course but if arranging for the care of the	girls must take time into account i think a day or two should be enough	to finish our business in.	3.6033443688531204
6534. to mark: please give my regards	to myra.	7.44330082843409
6535. she signed the letters quickly stamped them and	placed them on the hall table for raphael to mail in town.	3.9651410564672425
6536. then she	went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the	glare on the water.	5.952549042446694
6537. my nephews will be coming down she	said that evening as angelina brought her dinner into the dining room	the whole meal on a vast linen-covered tray.	3.5507511825153473
6538. she looked at the girl	speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years; from the	early evening lights of them which had first startled izaak to look	at	her in an uncousinly way they had faded to a near-absence of color which	had possibly from her constant looking at the water something of	the light of the sea in them.	4.528642088526167
6539. angelina placed the tray on the	table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth.	3.939400215427701
6540. she smiled	and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face.	6.197871288603115
6541. that	will be so nice for you mrs packard she said.	4.317068102383446
6542. her voice was	ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in sicilian brilliance before	the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose.	4.9081146434982985
6543. um said the old lady and brought her eyes down to the tray.	4.439290171351723
6544. you remember them i suppose?	9.82530560865697
6545.  she glinted suspiciously at the	dish before her: blowfish.	5.142927756812074
6546. i hope raphael bought them whole.	8.319042357048025
6547. angelina stepped back her eyes roaming the tray for omissions.	4.317068102383446
6548. then she looked at the old woman again her eyes calm.	6.812212593659948
6549. yes	she said i remember that they came here every summer.	4.317068102383446
6550. i used to play with the older one sometimes when he'd let me.	6.276955806067989
6551. abel?	10.144513917544229
6552. 	the name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips.	5.9245075971793435
6553. for an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through	her smile.	4.791989620052518
6554. she would have said triumph.	10.378763437677646
6555. then angelina turned and	with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen.	4.521022108713427
6556. jessica packard	lifted her head and followed the retreating figure her eyes resting	nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips.	4.949896456596922
6557. for a moment she held her face to the empty doorway; then she snorted	and groped for her fork.	4.329184848903544
6558. there's no greater catastrophe	in the universe she reflected dourly impaling tender green beans	on the silver fork than the dwindling away of a family.	4.714137561967006
6559. procreation	expansion proliferation- these are the laws of living things with	the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments: oblivion.	4.104915202112914
6560. when the fate of the individual is visited on the group then	warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed	ah then the true bitterness of	existence could be tasted.	5.097516132495016
6561. and indeed the young garden beans were brackish	in her mouth.	4.575818839100343
6562. she was the last living of the older generation.	8.404697309470158
6563. what had once been a widespread family- at one time she knew	there were enough packards to populate an entire county- had now	narrowed down to the two boys abel and mark.	4.07529753200943
6564. she swung her eyes up	to the blue of the window her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans.	5.666451881788332
6565. what hope lay in the nephews she asked the intensifying light out there	with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced having	sired two girl children with none to bear on the packard name?	3.751734882895207
6566. 	she ate.	11.155741451300253
6567. it seemed to her as it seemed each night that the gloom	drew itself in and became densest at the table's empty chairs	giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows.	3.60581753129451
6568. here too	she talked low quirking her head at one or another of the places	most often at izaak's armchair which faced her across the long table.	5.268697447018326
6569. or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed consciously	playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early	years.	5.02075665927492
6570. she thought again of her children those two who had	died young before the later science which might have saved them could	attach even a label to their separate malignancies.	4.702471644981103
6571. the girl her	first she barely remembered.	4.484690356992241
6572. it could have been anyone's infant for	it had not survived the bassinet.	7.549209371608783
6573. but the boy h the boy had been	alive yesterday.	5.087601517347678
6574. each successive movement in his growing was recorded	on the unreeling film inside her.	5.895569821710377
6575. he ran on his plump sticks of	legs	freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the	camera had caught and held on the paling photographs all carefully placed	and glued and labeled resting in the fat plush album in the bottom	drawer of the escritoire.	3.1250189447784917
6576. in the cruel clearness of her memory the	boy remained unchanged quick with the delight of laughter and the pain	with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable	to her.	4.658401824062775
6577. it was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water	on those days when she hated the sea.	3.9860294735642006
6578. the brothers drove	down together in mark's small red sports car mark at the wheel.	4.985577292126711
6579. abel sat and regarded the farm country which spreading	out from both sides of the road rolled greenly up to where the	silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields.	3.508379122360038
6580. he saw the land with a stranger's eyes all the old familiarness	gone.	6.451014915272466
6581. and it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger	impervious complete in itself.	4.6902795950992715
6582. there was stability there too- a	color which his life had had once.	6.5413570269113395
6583. that is what childhood is he told	himself.	6.454892461981257
6584. in the stiff neutral lines of the	telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of aunt jessica's	letter.	5.737571153605504
6585. what bad grace what incredible selfishness he and mark	had shown.	4.819390816781938
6586. the boyhood summers preceding their uncle's funeral might	never have been.	5.315964723648707
6587. they had closed over absolutely with the sealing	of old izaak's grave.	4.889556813154247
6588. the small car flew on relentlessly.	6.441151245199303
6589. the old	woman stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took	on an ominous reality.	3.923053945196595
6590. abel moved and adjusted his long legs.	6.743273855772659
6591. i suppose it has to do with the property mark had said over	the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters.	4.540844237685528
6592. not until the words had been spoken did abel suddenly see the old house	and the insistent sea and feel his contrition blotted out in one	shameful moment of covetousness.	5.035898194454044
6593. he and mark were the last of the family	and there lay the cape ann property which had seemed to have no	end stretching from horizon to horizon in those golden days of summer.	3.761238337137893
6594. now abel turned his head to look at his brother.	7.390016990541439
6595. mark held	the wheel loosely but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful	way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd	make in the years to come.	3.6895125024077835
6596. his sandy hair was already beginning	to thin and recede at the sides and abel looked quickly away.	5.503660330251405
6597. mark	easily looked years older than himself settled his world comfortably	categorized.	4.317068102383446
6598. the vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they	approached the sea.	5.315964723648707
6599. she didn't mention bringing myra mark	said maneuvering the car into the next lane.	4.248379634311886
6600. she's probably	getting old- crotchety i mean- and we figured uh-uh better not.	5.583228874976599
6601. they've never met you know.	5.619635421798327
6602. but myra wouldn't budge without	an express invitation.	7.343223252109154
6603. i feel kind of bad about it.	5.980958891716654
6604. he gave abel	a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel hugging it to him and	abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt.	5.287130044988127
6605. i imagine	the old girl hasn't missed us much mark added his eyes on the	road.	4.118642075596688
6606. abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation.	6.743273855772659
6607. it was barely possible that his brother was right.	5.120828854739623
6608. he could	tell they were approaching the sea.	7.042834174643505
6609. the air took on a special strength	now that they'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind.	3.6106344395413097
6610. there was the smell of the coast like a primeval memory composed	of equal parts salt water clams seaweed and northern air.	5.664839648090192
6611. he turned	from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy's eye	again the great fieldstone house which built on one of the many acres	of ancestral land bordering the west harbor had been izaak's bride-gift	to his cousin-wife as the last century ended.	3.373506510371279
6612. mark's	thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own climbing	the same crags in dirty white sneakers clambering out on top of the	headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant.	5.130520315220872
6613. remember the starbird?	8.518854066328114
6614.  mark asked and abel lifted his	eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road the twin white	ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of	the hill and came down.	5.034655800942242
6615. there	was the day uncle izaak had in an unexpected grandiose gesture	handed over the pretty sloop to abel for keeps on condition that	he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy	wished.	3.3230332169631454
6616. the two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team	h all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth	and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance	could.	5.1848118436179735
6617. they seemed then to have had a single mind and body a	mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth casually.	4.089755019761432
6618. he saw the starbird as she lay her slender mast up and gently	turning its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus	sky.	5.201574541464973
6619. both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her	waiting ready for the two of them to run up her sails.	5.146359718146127
6620. the starbird	had been long at the bottom of the bay.	6.657777472184964
6621. they came unexpectedly	upon the sea.	6.4555957476387915
6622. meeting it without preparation as they did robbed	of anticipation a common disappointment seized them.	5.771670545020984
6623. they were	climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid	blackness became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into	a faint mist of light and ended.	3.5855324756906364
6624. mark stopped the car and switched	off the lights and they sat looking at the water which there being	no moon out at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an	absence of stars.	4.715870466752536
6625. his eyes were old and they never saw well but heated with whisky they'd	glare at my noise growing red and raising up his rage.	3.5655862124401176
6626. i decided	i hated the pedersen kid too dying in our kitchen while i was away	where i couldn't watch dying just to entertain hans and making	me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall pa lumped under the	covers at the end like dung covered with snow snoring and whistling.	4.524346605689518
6627. oh he'd not care about the pedersen kid.	5.197170020599843
6628. he'd not care about getting	waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid	and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain.	5.142635426433149
6629. that would make	him mad enough if he was sober.	5.759683123650977
6630. i didn't hurry though it was cold	and the pedersen kid was in the kitchen.	6.622317621517132
6631. he was all shoveled	up like i thought he'd be.	5.117624340562427
6632. i pushed at his shoulder calling	his	name.	7.95751090267089
6633. i think his name stopped the snoring but he didn't move except	to roll a little when i shoved him.	4.019592290258753
6634. the covers slid down his skinny	neck so i saw his head fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed but	his face was turned to the wall- there was the pale shadow of his nose	on the plaster- and i thought well you don't look much like	a pig-drunk bully now.	4.3577765274225495
6635. i couldn't be sure he was still asleep.	5.100396573550883
6636. he	was a cagey sonofabitch.	8.77831138877909
6637. i shook him a little harder and made some noise.	4.91600348792687
6638. i was leaning too far over.	8.963000564203531
6639. he always slept close to the wall so you had to lean	to reach him.	4.74985596983899
6640. it put you off.	10.310232783428383
6641. i knew better but	i was thinking of the pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough.	4.408430855398244
6642. when his arm came up i ducked away but it caught me on the side of	the neck watering my eyes and i backed off to cough.	5.643230034362061
6643. pa was on his	side looking at me his eyes winking the hand that had hit me a fist	in the pillow.	3.542415248362911
6644. get the hell out of here.	7.89567621652591
6645. i didn't	say anything trying to get my throat clear but i watched him.	4.301675185289649
6646. he was like a mean horse to come at from the rear.	6.433435498565164
6647. it was better though	he'd hit me.	6.050103971507023
6648. he was bitter when he missed.	8.524995147246532
6649. get the	hell out of here.	6.296157972678366
6650. he told me to wake	you.	10.586459746025206
6651. a fat hell on big hans.	5.148049710636422
6652. he found the pedersen kid by the crib.	6.863161375740948
6653. pa pulled at the covers.	5.619635421798327
6654. he was tasting his mouth.	9.357464703205716
6655. hans is rubbing him with snow.	5.219666477665999
6656. he's got him in the kitchen.	8.489382144358915
6657. it's the pedersen kid.	6.671070901354667
6658. nothing	to steal from the crib.	7.712079578137997
6659. he was just	lying there.	7.6608138245793596
6660. that's where he was when hans	found him.	7.699208470401843
6661. i ain't hid nothing in	the crib.	5.79847623263147
6662. the pedersen	kid.	8.662994582415093
6663. the kid-   i god damn well understand.	4.280553672808819
6664. pa	had his head up glaring his teeth gnawing at the place where he'd	grown a mustache once.	5.245804033734669
6665. i god damn well understand.	6.316170410054584
6666. you	know i don't want to see pedersen.	7.813409650623253
6667. why should i?	9.857716403521119
6668.  what	did he come for hey?	7.712079578137997
6669.  god dammit get.	8.442351234194236
6670. find out something.	11.315652602339359
6671. both you and hans.	7.366517679772722
6672. he was shouting	and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow.	6.224836481016446
6673. he had long	black hairs on his wrist.	5.9526657256350495
6674. they curled around the cuff of his nightshirt.	6.8678274683203115
6675. big hans made me come.	5.619635421798327
6676. big hans said-   a	fat hell on big hans.	6.412214371980113
6677. he's an even bigger fool than you are.	4.6724501027054846
6678. fat hey?	11.431677227541094
6679.  i taught him dammit and i'll teach you.	5.100396573550883
6680. you	want me to drop my pot?	7.163184125958424
6681.    he was about to get up so i got	out slamming the door.	5.156969519918211
6682. he was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep.	6.912802246373433
6683. once he went after hans and dumped his pot	over the banister.	4.749642721323321
6684. pa'd been shit-sick in that pot.	7.163184125958424
6685. he didn't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part	of pa's door down before he stopped.	3.7125232616762074
6686. he might not have gone that	far if pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house.	5.531044775518156
6687. that pot put pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it.	4.507791580392683
6688. i	always felt the memory was present in both of them stirring in their	chests like a laugh or a growl as eager as an animal to be out.	4.566786271575569
6689. i	heard pa cursing all the way downstairs.	6.248401041659292
6690. hans had laid steaming	towels over the kid's chest and stomach.	5.9245075971793435
6691. he was rubbing snow on	the kid's legs and feet.	5.119057942974641
6692. water from the snow and water from the towels	had run off the kid to the table where the dough was and the dough	was turning pasty sticking to the kid's back and behind.	4.767054989653725
6693. ain't	he going to wake up?	5.619635421798327
6694.    what about your pa?	10.254368432795367
6695. 	he was awake when i left.	5.219666477665999
6696. what'd he say?	9.52328749892442
6697. 	did you get the whisky?	5.968019705870383
6698.    he said a fat hell on big	hans.	8.820376570908694
6699. did you ask him about the whisky?	5.498901206670715
6700. 	yeah.	13.921774766768346
6701. well?	10.144513917544229
6702.    he said	a fat hell on big hans.	7.042834174643505
6703. what's	he going to do?	6.162967476035402
6704.    go back to sleep most likely.	8.185543552829259
6705. you'd best get that whisky.	5.619635421798327
6706. pa's scared to hell of axes.	7.163184125958424
6707. listen to me jorge	i've had enough to your sassing.	4.873120369570775
6708. if i don't	get some whisky down him he might die.	7.0510258269488375
6709. you want the kid to die?	6.478673209080925
6710. 	do you?	11.155741451300253
6711.  well get your pa and get that whisky.	5.436649671045666
6712. pa	don't care about the kid.	7.712079578137997
6713. he don't care at all and i don't care to get my head	busted neither.	4.059146855086784
6714. he don't care and i don't care to have his shit	flung on me.	5.9790062964613435
6715. he don't care about anybody.	5.926245264679889
6716. all he cares about is	his whisky and that dry crack in his face.	6.0979446238984645
6717. get pig-drunk- that's	what he wants.	6.296157972678366
6718. he don't care about nothing else at all.	6.672854314451728
6719. that cock.	10.584532866645432
6720. i'll get the spirits ma said.	7.163184125958424
6721. i'd wound big	hans up tight.	5.619635421798327
6722. i was ready to jump but when ma said she'd get the	whisky it surprised him like it surprised me and he ran down.	5.399893508224824
6723. ma	never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off.	4.7377521986724895
6724. not for years.	13.216646341321509
6725. the first thing every morning when she washed her face	she could see the scar on her chin where he'd cut her with a boot	cleat and maybe she saw him heaving it again the dirty sock popping	out as it flew.	3.4351284761240755
6726. it should have been nearly as easy for her to remember	that as it was for big hans to remember going after the axe while	he was still spattered with pa's yellow sick insides.	5.418037093364491
6727. no	you won't big hans said.	5.619635421798327
6728. yes hans if they're	needed	ma said.	9.27537736129135
6729. hans shook his head but neither of us tried	to stop her.	4.182602481535312
6730. if we had then one of us would have had to go instead.	8.864594854577142
6731. hans rubbed the kid with more snow h rubbed h rubbed.	4.182602481535312
6732. i'll	get more snow i said.	7.712079578137997
6733. i took the pail and shovel and went	out on the porch.	4.485624797449411
6734. i don't know where ma went.	8.34079512640814
6735. i thought she'd	gone upstairs and expected to hear she had.	4.814075262234313
6736. she had surprised hans	like she had surprised me when she said she'd go and then she surprised	him again when she came back so quick like she must have because	when i	came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three	white feathers on its label and hans was holding it angrily by the throat.	4.488546378641454
6737. oh he was being queer and careful pawing about in the	drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm.	3.8510510002894645
6738. he was awful angry because he'd thought ma was going to do something	big something heroic even especially for her h i know him h	i know him h we felt the same sometimes h while ma wasn't thinking	about	that at all not anything like that.	4.696179794429959
6739. there was no way of getting	even.	7.228853778991672
6740. it wasn't like getting cheated at the fair.	7.3180070949138205
6741. they were always	trying so you got to expect it.	5.182129981445482
6742. now hans had given ma something of	his- we both had when we thought she was going straight to pa-	something valuable; but since she didn't know we'd given it to her	there was no easy way of getting it back.	4.564332343072701
6743. hans cut the foil	off finally and unscrewed the cap.	4.477601198394805
6744. he was put out too because there	was only one way of understanding what she'd done.	6.028294859666473
6745. ma had found one	of pa's hiding places.	4.913686410369733
6746. she'd found one and she hadn't said a	word while big hans and i had hunted and hunted as we always did all	winter every winter since the spring that hans had come and i had	looked in the privy and found the first one.	4.3575355529039745
6747. pa had a knack for hiding.	5.219666477665999
6748. he knew we were looking and he enjoyed it.	6.966952486248086
6749. she'd	found it by luck most likely but she hadn't said anything and we didn't	know how long ago it'd been or how many other ones she'd found	saying nothing.	3.3277242066172517
6750. pa was sure to find out.	7.163184125958424
6751. sometimes he didn't	seem to because he hid them so well he couldn't find them himself or	because he looked and didn't find anything and figured he hadn't	hid one after all or had drunk it up.	3.3276875916261597
6752. but he'd find out about this	one because we were using it.	6.254354435712039
6753. a fool could see what was going on.	4.827236429512315
6754. if	he found out ma found it- that'd be bad.	6.1753962075700795
6755. he took pride in his	hiding.	6.564974396818768
6756. it was all the pride he had.	8.037483603153722
6757. i guess fooling hans and me took	doing.	5.406629921006237
6758. but he didn't figure ma for much.	8.348116327549514
6759. he didn't figure her	at all and if he found out	h a woman h it'd be bad.	3.947758623433152
6760. hans	poured some in a tumbler.	7.712079578137997
6761. you going to put more towels on him?	5.76120363811175
6762. 	no.	13.921774766768346
6763. why not?	10.943003841539923
6764.  that's what he needs	something warm to his skin don't he?	5.9245075971793435
6765.    not where	he's froze good.	7.708138494453364
6766. that's why i only	put towels on his chest and belly.	6.000638608808307
6767. he's got to thaw slow.	5.619635421798327
6768. you ought	to know that.	11.1064335578917
6769. colors on the towels had run.	5.302595412184967
6770. ma poked	her toe in the kid's clothes.	6.743273855772659
6771. what are we going to do	with these?	6.854168315248656
6772.    big hans began pouring whisky in the kid's	mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in	a second it was dripping from his chin.	4.566786271575569
6773. here help me prop	him up.	6.984592253195126
6774. i got hold his mouth open.	7.953610286112768
6775. i didn't want to touch	him and i hoped ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's	clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't	make any move to.	3.5989430320421127
6776. lift don't shove h lift.	7.712079578137997
6777. i took him by the shoulders.	6.498975818214458
6778. his mouth fell open.	9.01519275079499
6779. the skin on his neck was tight.	4.280481675000459
6780. he	was cold all right.	8.581068652988327
6781. his mouth is open.	6.5691874679720135
6782. he'll choke anyway.	9.52328749892442
6783. don't hold him like	that.	6.162967476035402
6784. put your arms around him.	9.09286509856925
6785. he was cold all right.	6.8185940733068335
6786. i put my arm carefully around him.	8.038885123585313
6787. hans had	his fingers in the kid's mouth.	4.913686410369733
6788. now he'll choke for sure.	9.04425245534422
6789. just hold him like i told you.	5.81945357902235
6790. he	was cold all right and wet.	7.246638991519576
6791. i had my arm behind his back.	6.568962365243599
6792. he was in his mid-fifties at this time long past the establishment of	his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again and it was almost	a decade since he had sworn off lecturing.	5.613369149955465
6793. there was never a doubt	any more how his structures would be received; it was always the same	unqualified success now.	4.002437411537497
6794. he could no longer build anything whether	a private residence in his pennsylvania county or a church in brazil	without it being obvious that he had done it and while here and there	he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique	they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the	public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time a quality	of authentic uniqueness about them which once established by an	artist as his private vision is no longer disputable as to its other	values.	4.459437512626709
6795. stowey rummel was internationally famous a crafter of a genuine	americana in foreign eyes an original designer whose inventive	childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere	by his personality.	3.2653762695140407
6796. he had lived for almost thirty years in this	same stone farmhouse with the same wife a remarkably childish thing	in itself; he rose at half-past six every morning made himself some	french coffee had his corn flakes and more coffee smoked four cigarettes	while reading last sunday's herald tribune and yesterday's	pittsburgh gazette then put on his high-topped farmer's	shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop.	4.31483974455383
6797. this was an enormously	long building whose walls were made of rocks some of them brought	home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist.	4.002335939454594
6798. the debris of his other careers was piled everywhere; a pile of	wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying	on its side on the window sill vertical steel columns wired for support	to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting	out into the air masonry constructions on the floor from the time he	was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through	a whole house visible all the way up through wire gratings on each	floor.	4.219514640473218
6799. his files desk drafting board and a high stool formed the only	clean island in the chaos.	3.9552152449482603
6800. everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in	visible form: his models drawings ten-foot canvases in monochromes	from his painting days and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books	that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac.	4.458029240067468
6801. bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for	the camden cycly company plant hung on a rope in one corner and over	his desk next to several old and dusty hats was a clean pair of roller	skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house.	3.5046889139417132
6802. he worked standing with his left hand in his pocket as though he	were merely stopping for a moment sketching with the surprised stare	of one who was watching another person's hand.	5.010370850122969
6803. sometimes he would	grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him sometimes he would	look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved.	3.631344093124259
6804. it	all seemed- if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows-	as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler's	neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss's	work.	4.7714372937191145
6805. this air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude	toward his things and people often mistook it for boredom in him	or a surrender to repetitious routine.	3.4950106544593105
6806. but he was not bored at	all;	he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite	wonderful that the world admired it and he could not imagine why he	should alter it.	5.737515477513335
6807. there are after all fortunate souls who hear everything	but only know how to listen to what is good for them and stowey	was as things go a fortunate man.	4.227666421260026
6808. he left his home the	day after new year's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and	without a hat.	5.302202326604372
6809. he would wear this same costume in florida despite his	wife cleota's reminders over the past five days that he must take	some cool clothes with him.	3.7306331271523097
6810. but he was too busy to hear what she was	saying.	7.622108807569868
6811. so they parted when she was in an impatient humor.	5.842371650340682
6812. when he	was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon feeling in his trouser	cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before	she came out of the house with an enormous rumanian shawl over her	head which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad	and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window.	4.933042408161022
6813. finding	the key under his shoe he started the engine and while it warmed up	he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog and said defrost	the refrigerator.	3.625680371692199
6814. he saw the surprise in her face and	laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen.	6.286360087464897
6815. he kept on laughing until she started laughing with him.	4.59553729660542
6816. he had a deep	voice which was full of good food she had cooked and good humor;	an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it.	5.428421530222087
6817. he would	settle himself into his seat to laugh.	5.047266242817301
6818. whenever he laughed it was	all he was doing.	7.046780769209505
6819. and she was made to fall in love with him again there	in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog mad as she was	at his going away when he really didn't have to mad at their both	having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a	week to go by.	3.7685212661849534
6820. she was forty-nine at this time a lanky woman of breeding	with an austere narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple	or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn	sort of prayer.	5.149970714199435
6821. her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two	lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair	that fell to her shoulders.	3.5953952484801976
6822. there was an air of blindness in her	gray eyes the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women	who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from	money-making and which besides has kept its estate intact.	5.075312421816364
6823. she was	personally sloppy and when she had colds would blow her nose in the	same handkerchief all day and keep it soaking wet dangling from her	waist and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves.	3.3568960285509246
6824. but just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood	she would disappear and come down bathed brushed and taking	breaths of air and even with her broken nails her hands would come to	rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy a grace of history	so to speak and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she	was and adamant on certain questions of personal value.	4.29373591661416
6825. she even spoke	differently when she was clean and she was clean now for his departure	and her voice clear and rather sharp.	3.9503017259037763
6826. now drive carefully	for god's sake! she called trying to attain a half humorous	resentment at his departure.	5.520169315656504
6827. but he did not notice and was already	backing the car down to the road saying toot-toot! to the	stump of a tree as he passed it the same stump which had impaled the	car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to	have removed.	3.8469143620051405
6828. she stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until	he had swung the car onto the road.	5.442661456391538
6829. then when he had it pointed	down the hill he stopped to gaze at her through the window.	4.40124319960784
6830. she had	begun to turn back toward the house but his look caught her and she stood	still waiting there for what his expression indicated would be	a	serious word of farewell.	4.893431682443328
6831. he looked at her out of himself she thought	as he did only for an instant at a time the look which always surprised	her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and	his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs the look of the	gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the tate	gallery on a thursday once.	3.1879645864683526
6832. now she kept herself protectively ready	to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger	and said toot! once more and roared off into the fog his foot	evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed	the accelerator just as his hand did when he worked.	4.530538540256346
6833. she walked back	to the house and entered feeling herself returning sensing some kind	of opportunity in the empty building.	4.110794065438101
6834. there is a death in all partings	she knew and promptly put it out of her mind.	6.334696123469044
6835. she enjoyed	great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking	all night but it always seemed to her that being alone especially	alone in her house was the realest part of life.	3.315617098226871
6836. now she could let out	the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that stowey	would let them out one of the doors; she could dust the plants	then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the	middle	on; improvise cha-chas on the harp; and finally the best part of	all simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine	and the newspapers reading the ads as well as the news registering	nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing	and desire.	4.467964969609424
6837. she did this now comfortably aware of the mist running	down the windows of the silence outside of the dark afternoon	it was getting to be.	4.071874283702151
6838. she fell asleep leaning on her hand hearing the	house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own	these two hundred years hearing the birds rustling in their cages and	the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and	walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm.	4.7683291034327056
6839. every	few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things: stowey	yes was on his way south and the two boys were away in school and	nothing was burning on the stove and lucretia was coming for dinner	and bringing three guests of hers.	3.4609340827596062
6840. then she fell asleep again as soddenly	as a person with fever and when she awoke it was dark outside	and the clarity was back in her eyes.	4.972362551895511
6841. she stood up smoothing her hair	down straightening her clothes feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping	darkness outside and above everything else for the absence of	the need to answer to respond to be aware even of stowey coming in	or going out and yet now that she was beginning to cook she glimpsed	a future without him a future alone like this and the pain made her	head writhe and in a moment she found it hard to wait for lucretia	to come with her guests.	3.2513872089006117
6842. she went into the living room and turned on	three lamps then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling	light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn illuminating	the driveway.	5.1351306934611545
6843. she knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at	herself.	4.8743285955128695
6844. they were both so young after all so unready for any final	parting.	6.447922236777523
6845. how could it have been thirty years already she wondered?	5.414269050230888
6846. 	but yes nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine and she was forty-nine	and she had been married at nineteen.	5.46157340722468
6847. she stood still over the leg	of lamb rubbing herbs into it quite suddenly conscious of a nausea	in her stomach and a feeling of wrath a sensation of violence that started	her shivering.	3.5163927319468415
6848. but they all said no your time will come.	7.39929855459104
6849. enjoy being a	bride while you can.	5.219666477665999
6850. there was no room for company in the	tiny weaning house	.	7.755399955247291
6851. so when the	big house filled up and ran over the sisters-in-law found beds for	everyone in their own homes.	4.144703382720408
6852. and there was still not anything that linda	kay could do.	8.652237413160258
6853. so linda kay gave up asking and accepted	her reprieve.	5.014525072717853
6854. without saying so she was really grateful; for to	attend the dying was something she had never experienced and certainly	had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as bobby	joe's wife.	4.864112791824134
6855. she had made curtains for all the windows of her	little house and she had kept it spotless and neat shabby as it was	and cooked good meals for bobby joe.	3.8326438654125043
6856. she had done all the things she	had promised herself she would do but she had not thought of this.	5.53256036925417
6857. people died she would have said in hospitals or in cars on the highway	at night.	4.540879644714068
6858. bobby joe was gone all day now not coming in	for dinner and sometimes not for supper.	5.367600610393761
6859. when they first married he	had been working in the fields all day and she would get in the car and	drive to wherever he was working to take him a fresh hot meal.	3.597248972932802
6860. now	there was no work in the fields nor would there be till it rained	and she did not know where he went.	5.4727980205497655
6861. not that she complained or had any	cause to.	5.841419920308816
6862. four or five of the cousins from east texas were about	his age so naturally they ran around together.	5.943167701047308
6863. there was no reason	for her to ask what they did.	5.448277031678145
6864. thus a new pattern of days began	to develop for granny albright did not die.	5.934183943562925
6865. she lay still on the	bed her head hardly denting the pillow; sometimes she opened her eyes	and looked around and sometimes she took a little milk or soup.	3.4536315565375904
6866. they	stopped expecting her to die the next minute but only in the next	day or two.	5.863338517920722
6867. those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would	not go home for she might die any time; but they might as well	unpack their suitcases for she might linger on.	3.6069407856855387
6868. so the pattern	was established.	11.673901374925636
6869. when linda kay had put up her breakfast dishes	and mopped her linoleum rugs she would go to the big house.	4.282612904937545
6870. there	was not anything she could do there but that was where everyone was	or would be.	5.869726053139971
6871. bobby joe and the boys would come by say how's granny?	4.762504555617022
6872. 	and sit on the porch a while.	7.16720625786349
6873. the older men would be there	at noon and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off	to the creek or drove down the road towards town.	3.3786250935898794
6874. the women and	children stayed at the albrights'.	6.766113082881207
6875. the women keeping their voices	low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room sounded	like chickens shut up in a coop for the night.	3.9374120463263087
6876. the children had to	play away from the house	to maintain a proper quietness.	6.369588205432934
6877. off and on all day someone	would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything.	3.8729991569368276
6878. the evaporative cooler had been moved to granny's room and	her door was kept shut; so that the rest of the house stayed open	though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that	way.	5.743689066387198
6879. the dust clogged their throats and the heat parched them	so that the women were always making ice water.	3.4574292614114666
6880. they had cleaned	up an old ice box and begun to buy fifty-pound blocks of ice in town	as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for	the crowds who ate and drank there.	4.69920725255378
6881. one afternoon as the women	sat clucking softly a new carload of people pulled up at the gate.	4.336154436653155
6882. it was a cadillac black grayed with the dust of the road its windows	closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would	be cool and unwrinkled.	5.5724029442163445
6883. they were an old fat couple	a thick middle-aged man and a girl about	ten or twelve.	4.756400213105925
6884. there was much embracing much exclaiming.	9.228565990595198
6885. cousin	ada! cousin john! cousin lura! cousin	howard! and how is she?	4.317068102383446
6886.  about the same john	about	the same.	12.109309298771544
6887. all the women got up and offered their chairs and	when they were all seated again the guests made their inquiries and	their explanations.	3.9021707393867224
6888. we were on our vacation in canada	howard explained in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming	and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home.	5.345258027868081
6889. we came on as soon as we could.	6.269575723147427
6890. there was the suggestion	of ice water and- in spite of the protest we're not really	thirsty- linda kay to escape the stuffy air and the smothering	soft voices hurried to the kitchen.	5.567646349962358
6891. she filled a big pitcher	and set it with glasses on a tray.	4.371911722426681
6892. carrying it to the living room	she imagined the picture she made: tall and roundly slim a bit sophisticated	in her yellow sheath with a graceful swingy walk that she	had learned as a twirler with the school band.	4.662926357776352
6893. almost immediately she	was ashamed of herself for feeling vain at such a time in such a	place and she tossed back her long yellow hair smiling shyly as she	entered the room.	3.529253406726366
6894. howard was looking	at her.	9.159848272951336
6895. she felt the look and looked back because she could not help	it seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first	believed.	3.7736181826791175
6896. and who is this?	10.063116183642284
6897.  he asked when she passed	him a glass.	5.821604582290708
6898. oh that's linda kay mama albright	said fondly.	7.573472848649923
6899. she married our baby boy bobby joe this summer.	4.892221409626493
6900. let's see cousin ada said.	7.712079578137997
6901. he's a right smart	younger than the rest?	4.913686410369733
6902.    oh yes mama laughed.	9.921711973122616
6903. he's	ten years younger than ernest.	5.619635421798327
6904. we didn't expect him to come	along; thought for the longest he was a tumor.	6.631421525529209
6905. this joke	was not funny to linda kay and she blushed as she always did;	then hearing the muffled boom of howard's laughter blushed redder.	3.4795380163968237
6906. who is howard anyway?	11.456909155768349
6907.  she asked bobby joe that	night.	6.835242938944747
6908. oh he's a second	cousin or something.	8.139033152085785
6909. he got in the oil business out at odessa and	lucked into some money.	4.572828611208705
6910. how old is he?	11.456244291793766
6911.    gosh	i don't know.	6.939425769494729
6912. he's been married and	got this half-grown kid.	6.93577205170572
6913. if he bothers you don't pay him any mind.	5.603164756174088
6914. he's just a big windbag.	8.120329479697324
6915. bobby joe was thinking about something	else.	5.696123545021529
6916. say did you know they're fixing to have a two-day antelope	season on the double x?	5.930109810620036
6917.    he was talking about antelope	again when they woke up.	5.554746838458916
6918. listen i never had a chance to	kill an antelope.	6.213536229287492
6919. there never was a season before but now they want	to thin 'em out on account of the drouth.	4.248204968719345
6920. did he ever	visit here when he was a kid?	9.354482636115277
6921.  linda kay asked.	6.939425769494729
6922. when he	was a kid i wasn't around.	7.710409330756385
6923. bobby joe took a gun from behind	the door and with a quick bye now was gone for the day.	4.033438863901578
6924. almost immediately howard and his daughter debora drove up in	the cadillac.	6.352293280604141
6925. we're going after ice howard said	and	thought maybe you'd go along and keep us company.	3.8849121559715263
6926. there	was really no reason to refuse and linda kay had never ridden in	a cadillac.	6.265876373104651
6927. driving along the caliche-topped road to town howard	talked.	4.6724501027054846
6928. finally he said tell me about yourself and linda	kay told him because she thought herself that she had had an interesting	life.	5.734564681709405
6929. she was such a well-rounded teenager having been a twirler	future farmers sweetheart and secretary of future homemakers.	4.092438085435951
6930. in her sophomore year she had started going steady with bobby joe	who was a football player future homemakers sweetheart and president	of future farmers.	5.084988571273635
6931. it was easy to see that they were made for	each other and they knew what they wanted.	5.107690163526981
6932. bobby joe would be a senior	this year and he planned to graduate.	6.935283080477038
6933. but there was no need for	linda kay to go on since all she wanted in life was to make a home	for bobby joe and raise his children.	4.380575493090579
6934. you lucky kids he said.	9.82530560865697
6935. i'd give anything if i could	have found a girl like you.	4.182602481535312
6936. then he told linda kay about himself.	8.406947006621987
6937. of course he couldn't say much really because of debora but	linda kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and	what a raw deal he had got.	3.7020959908027375
6938. it made her feel different about howard.	8.339420923799064
6939. she was going to tell bobby joe about how mistaken she had	been but he brought one of the cousins home for supper and all they	did was talk about antelope.	4.077475588328119
6940. bobby joe was trying to get linda	kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home.	5.187261497912293
6941. cook	a whole antelope?	6.939425769494729
6942.  she exclaimed.	13.515432363756661
6943. why i couldn't even cook	a piece of antelope steak; i never even saw any.	4.4376918767394
6944. i want to roast the whole thing and have it for the boys.	7.16900024306073
6945. linda kay told him he couldn't do anything like that	with his grandma dying and he said well they had to eat didn't	they they weren't all dying.	3.602635644163082
6946. linda kay felt like going off to the	bedroom to cry; but they were going up to the big house after supper	and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little.	5.181925708781118
6947. every night they all went to mama and papa albright's and	sat on the open front porch where they could get the breeze.	4.028951545007274
6948. it was	full-of-the-moon and nearly light as day.	7.788832957144139
6949. they all	sat around and drank ice water and the men smoked and everybody had	a good time.	4.316142884519143
6950. once in a while they said what a shame it was with granny	dying but they all agreed she wouldn't have wanted it any other	way.	5.083319941422643
6951. that night the older men got to talking about going possum-hunting	on a moonlight night.	4.242222163647526
6952. bobby joe and two or three of the	other boys declared they had never been possum-hunting and uncle bill	farnworth said he would	just get	up from there and take them right then.	5.04463716755513
6953. after they	had left some of the people moved around to find more comfortable places	to sit.	5.3886644894617
6954. there were not many chairs so that some preferred to sit	on the edge of the porch resting their feet on the ground and others	liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall.	5.598372390162982
6955. howard	who had been sitting against the wall said he needed more fresh air	and took the spot on the edge of the porch where bobby joe had been	sitting.	3.698576680806037
6956. you'll be a darn sight more comfortable there howard	ernest said laughing and they all laughed.	5.2288514545018705
6957. linda	kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable.	5.535292109416735
6958. bobby joe had	been sitting close to her touching her actually and holding her hand	from time to time but it seemed at once that howard sat much closer.	4.921148176483034
6959. perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh so that more of	it seemed to come in contact with hers; but she had never been so aware	of anyone's flesh before.	3.922440782931817
6960. still she was not sorry he sat	by her but in fact was flattered.	6.218405134014194
6961. he had become the center of the	company such stories he had to tell.	6.23651793983519
6962. he had sold oil stock to bob hope	and bing crosby in person; he had helped fight an oil-well fire	that raged six days and nights.	5.03861920710481
6963. but tell me doctor where do you plan to conduct the hatching?	4.775242596274291
6964. 	alex asked.	11.155741451300253
6965. that will have to be in the hotel	the doctor retorted confirming alex's anticipations.	6.813155378973
6966. what i	want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning	and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel.	6.260262880485122
6967. the doctor paid	the bill and they repaired to the hotel room number nine to initiate	alex further into these undertakings.	3.4987248494225156
6968. the doctor opened	the smallest of his cases an unimposing straw bag and exposed the contents	for alex's inspection.	4.704927659115509
6969. inside carefully packed in straw	were six eggs but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect	what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside; to alex	they were merely six not unusual hens' eggs.	3.339750938620079
6970. there was little enough	time to contemplate them however; in an instant the doctor was stalking	across the room with an antique ledger in his hands thoroughly	eared and big as a table top.	5.007702519664172
6971. he placed it on alex's lap.	5.475289483739853
6972. this is my hen ledger he informed him in an absorbed way.	6.592026757248745
6973. it's	been going since 1908 when i was a junior in college.	5.008193593515339
6974. that first	entry there is the vermont flumenophobe the earliest and one of	the most successful of my eighty-three varieties- great big scapulars	and hardly any primaries at all.	5.42563788162332
6975. couldn't take them near a river	though or they'd squawk like a turkey cock the day before thanksgiving.	3.8264651808655006
6976. the ledger was full of most precise information:	date of laying length of incubation period number of chicks reaching	the first week second week fifth week weight of hen size of rooster's	wattles and so on all scrawled out in a hand that looked more	chinese than english the most jagged and sprawling alex had ever seen.	4.192775843908116
6977. below these particulars was a series of alpha-beta-gammas connected	by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed.	4.189932052202214
6978. alex's	instruction was rapid for the doctor had to go off to the rue	ecole de medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip	of wine to sustain him through them all.	4.650650305457523
6979. but after the doctor's return	that night alex could see from the high window in his own room	the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels	apparently giving its egg-hatching powers one final chance before it	was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen.	3.3252663526364876
6980. a knocking at	alex's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning.	5.535226767350575
6981. it	was the doctor dressed and ready for the expedition to the market and	alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste.	3.8513896406946033
6982. the doctor stood about	waiting for alex to dress with a show of impatience and soon they	were moving as quietly as could be through the still-dark hallways	past the bedroom of the patronne and so into the street.	4.24718718362357
6983. the	market was not far and once there the doctor's sense of immediacy	left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him.	3.831992375646627
6984. he stroked the hens and they responded with delighted clucks he gobbled	with the turkeys and they at once were all attention he quacked	with the ducks and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese.	4.668960302024453
6985. the dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be	done with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery.	3.3836665878092216
6986. it was a fine broody hen white with a maternal eye and a striking	abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen.	5.198562953534361
6987. the doctor	with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope	drew alex's attention to those excellences which might otherwise	have escaped him: the fine color in comb and wattles the length and	quality of neck and saddle hackles the firm wide spread of the	toes and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets.	3.1239659833545232
6988. all search	was ended; he had found his fowl.	7.75507795282603
6989. the purchase was effected and	they made their way towards the hotel again the hen with whom some	sort of communication had been set up nestling in the doctor's arms.	3.2498789823986436
6990. the clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel	entrance; and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still	be abed began to rise in alex's well exercised breast.	4.485292613259531
6991. the doctor	was wearing a long new england greatcoat hardly necessary in the	june weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration	of hens.	3.291561882392835
6992. alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who	for all his care manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where	the hen was cradled.	5.166861619875375
6993. they advanced in a line across the entrance	hall	to the stairway and up with gingerly steps towards the first landing.	3.9017353139872886
6994. it was then that they heard the tread of one descending and in	some perturbation glancing up saw the patronne coming towards them	as they gained the landing.	4.907485428869373
6995. bonjour messieurs vous etes	matinals she greeted them pleasantly.	4.6724501027054846
6996. alex explained that they had	been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around	behind him attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind	alex's arm and back.	4.581021337040086
6997. vous voulez vos petits dejeuners	tout de suite alors?	4.6724501027054846
6998.  their hostess enquired.	11.102119689654566
6999. alex told her that	there was no hurry for their breakfasts trying at the same time to	effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him.	3.7503485737118334
7000. the	doctor he noticed was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs	but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible	cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well.	4.6001506080435455
7001. eyes swerved	in the patronne's head alex coughed loudly and the doctor	with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him took to the stairs	in long-shanked leaps.	3.377283645704905
7002. comment?	13.921774766768346
7003.  ejaculated the surprised	woman looking at alex for an explanation but he parting from	her without ceremony only offered a few words about the doctor's	provincial american speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands	of his work.	3.399868837629274
7004. with that he hurried up the stairs followed by her	suspicious	gaze.	7.174005840638549
7005. when alex entered his room the doctor was already	preparing a nest in the straw case six eggs ready for the hen's	attentions.	3.8020889124382564
7006. there was no reference to the incident on the stairs his	powers being absorbed by this more immediate business.	6.176712752892166
7007. the hen appeared	to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down	to the performance of them.	3.544369200628927
7008. one part of her audience was totally engaged	the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some	ancient classic the other part the guest of the connoisseur attentive	as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does	not fully understand.	4.526412901019994
7009. the spectacle progressed towards a denouement which	was obviously still remote; the audience attended.	3.6311862882065773
7010. time elapsed	but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome	knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature.	5.172703830330678
7011. startled	he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view and alex went to the	door.	3.744109221929566
7012. he opened it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling	coughing and scraping noise as possible in order to drown emanations	from the hen who had begun to protest.	5.142419632979375
7013. it was giselle the fille de	chambre come to clean the room and while she stood before him with	ears pricked up and regard all curiosity explaining her errand alex	could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could	to calm the displeased bird.	3.230945255334953
7014. giselle was reluctant but alex succeeded	in persuading her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut	again.	4.920292053327142
7015. who was that young feller?	6.821715080148493
7016.  the doctor instantly	asked.	7.666967087260189
7017. that was the fille de chambre the one you thought	couldn't get the eggs out.	4.879510945094999
7018. she looked mighty interested though.	8.764473609234177
7019. anyhow she's coming back in five minutes to do the room.	4.639541010945483
7020. the doctor's mind was working at a great speed; he rose to put	his greatcoat on and addressed alex in a muted voice.	4.489187264353258
7021. have	you got our keys handy?	5.619635421798327
7022.    right in my pocket.	8.653767173942132
7023. now you go outside and beckon me when it's safe.	4.782724544520212
7024. the hall was empty and alex beckoned; they climbed the stairs	which creaked very loudly to their sensitive ears and reached the next	floor.	4.4891393485363755
7025. a guest was locking his room; they passed behind him and	got to alex's room unnoticed.	3.782553131683091
7026. the doctor sat down rather wearily	caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a	poultry-loving man but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this	door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more.	4.487340481686588
7027. at	the door alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille	de chambre to return in ten minutes.	4.185576934899444
7028. it was evident that a second	transfer had to be effected and that it had to take place between the	time the fille finished the doctor's room and the time she began	alex's.	5.676535761064269
7029. they waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe;	the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine	and listened at the door.	3.44488687744355
7030. a bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows	being arranged indicated the fille de chambre's presence inside;	they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced	another important fact.	4.546479068016565
7031. the doctor shot down to the lavatory and turned	the doorknob but to no effect: the lavatory was occupied.	3.6961373828726702
7032. although	a look of alarm passed over his face he did not arrest his movements	but disappeared into the shower room just as the chambermaid emerged	from number nine.	5.189587560541218
7033. alex suppressed those expressions of relief which	offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat; unwarranted	they were in any case for as he stood facing the fille de chambre	his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower	room.	3.202343786175715
7034. the events of the last quarter of an hour mysterious to	any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard	had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series of cackly wails	perhaps mourning her nest but briefly enjoyed.	4.899235739187727
7035. the doctor's	wits had not left him however for all his sixty-eight years and the	wails were almost immediately lost in the sound of water rushing out	from the showerhead.	3.6418477999430876
7036. alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual	were taking place and entered the doctor's room.	5.138210239895059
7037. shortly the doctor	himself entered his hair somewhat wet from the shower but evidently	satisfied with the outcome of their adventures.	3.9367997698248063
7038. without comment he	opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a highboard around	the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside.	5.902880719564579
7039. next the hen	was nested and all seemed well.	5.3599486534602665
7040. the two men sat for some time savoring	the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings	before they got up and left the hotel the doctor to go to the conference	house and alex to go to the main post office.	5.233174368566385
7041. alex returned	to the hotel rather weary and with no new prospects of a role	in the late afternoon but found the doctor in an ebullient mood.	3.3952835315045036
7042. at	the time alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication	with the hen who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully	after the occurrences of the morning.	4.922702558979818
7043. chickens have short	memories the doctor remarked that's why they are better company	than most people i know and he went on to break some important	news to alex.	3.778198497361903
7044. well he began it seems like some people	in paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference	house do.	5.21774602630289
7045. they've got a big vulture from tanganika at the	zoo here with a wife for him too very rare birds both of them the	only vulturidae of their species outside africa.	3.3394496754233725
7046. seems like	she's	willing but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy	who took jeannie may behind the barn and then didn't know what to	do and the people at the zoo haven't got any vulture chicks to show	for their trouble.	4.620489285388571
7047. going downstairs with the tray winston wished he could have	given in to miss ada but he knew better than to do what she said when	she had that little-girl look.	3.357281946814185
7048. there were times it wasn't right	to make a person happy like the times she came in the kitchen and asked	for a peanut butter sandwich.	5.633858865682676
7049. you know we don't keep peanut butter	in this house he always told her.	4.714612851233268
7050. why winston she'd	cry i just now saw you eating it out of the jar! but he	knew how important it was for her to keep her figure.	5.587412272843849
7051. in the	kitchen leona his little young wife was reading the morning paper.	4.241741874725852
7052. her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool.	5.930244699873907
7053. here winston said gently what's these dishes doing not	washed?	5.205015710897248
7054.  the enormous plates which had held mr jack's four	fried eggs and five strips of bacon were still stacked in the sink.	4.631558156631713
7055. leave me alone leona said.	5.722905047556491
7056. can't you see i'm	busy?	8.457718703298294
7057.  she looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper.	5.073262983325933
7058. this is moving day winston reminded her and i bet	you left things every which way upstairs your clothes all over the	floor and the bed not made.	4.953795659396535
7059. leona! his eye had fastened on her	leg; bending he touched her knee.	4.0683852436856025
7060. if i catch you one more time	down here without stockings-   she twitched her leg away.	5.944448930397632
7061. she had an alley cat's manners.	6.928993517705105
7062. winston stacked miss ada's thin pink dishes in the sink.	5.9245075971793435
7063. then he	spread out the last list on the counter.	4.898170719950779
7064. to be left behind	was printed at the top in miss ada; fine hand.	7.1602472606883865
7065. winston took out	a pencil admired the point and wrote slowly and heavily clothes	stand.	4.065219046336222
7066. sighing leona dropped the paper and stood up.	6.630733016154121
7067. i	guess i better get ready to go.	5.444881089310859
7068. winston watched her fumbling	to untie her apron.	6.743273855772659
7069. carefully he undid the bow.	5.619635421798327
7070. how come your bows is always cockeyed?	7.880231792260334
7071.    she turned and	put her arms around his neck.	5.2860793776493225
7072. i don't want to leave here winston.	8.15501080847168
7073. he drew back embarrassed	and pleased.	5.926245264679889
7074. i thought you was sick to death of this big house.	6.354465057492727
7075. said	you wore yourself out cleaning all these empty rooms.	4.477601198394805
7076. at	least there is room here she said.	6.855014831305554
7077. what room is there going	to be in an apartment for any child?	4.479710107422397
7078.    i told you what	miss ada's doctor said.	8.23475385347124
7079. i don't mean miss ada!	what you think i care about that?	4.538387086843915
7080.  i mean our children.	10.171015467187765
7081. she	sounded as though they already existed.	5.975484519024878
7082. in spite of the hundred	things he had on his mind winston went and put his arm around her	waist.	6.035382615476274
7083. we've got plenty of time to think about that.	5.042859576761089
7084. all the	time in the world.	9.001313582608027
7085. we've only been married four years january.	4.913686410369733
7086. that's a long time waiting.	9.983102335411894
7087. how many times have i told you- he began and	was almost glad when she cut him off- too many times!-	and flounced to the sink where she began noisily to wash her hands.	3.380908266968055
7088. too many times was the truth of it winston thought.	6.8659417171148185
7089. he hardly	believed his reason himself any more.	5.131969917669621
7090. although it had seemed a good	reason to begin with: no couple could afford to have children.	5.947367222092987
7091. how you going to work with a child hanging on you?	5.4543353468963005
7092.  he asked	leona.	12.081077223713681
7093. you want to keep this job don't you?	6.502640180080183
7094.  he doubted	whether she heard him over the running water.	6.561008839042252
7095. he sat for a	while with his hands on his knees watching the bend of her back as she	gathered up her things- a comb a bottle of aspirin- to take upstairs	and pack.	3.382365002071148
7096. she made him sad some days and he was never sure why;	it was something to do with her back the thinness of it and the	quick jerky way she bent.	5.8130700954157914
7097. she was too young that was all; too young	and thin and straight.	4.95552547042042
7098. winston!   it was mr	jack bellowing out in the hall.	7.191683128437015
7099. winston hurried through the swinging	door.	5.619635421798327
7100. i've been bursting my lungs for you mr jack	complained.	6.266277551462564
7101. he was standing in front of the mirror tightening his tie.	5.805421973570849
7102. he had on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat and his brief	case lay on the bench.	5.5958123216511515
7103. i don't know what you think you've been	doing about my clothes he said.	4.475978247953592
7104. this coat looks like a rag heap.	7.8760979495415455
7105. there were a few blades of lint on the shoulder.	5.778114628333785
7106. winston	took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work.	6.861766828041403
7107. he gave mr	jack a real going-over; he brushed his shoulders and his back	and his collar with long firm strokes.	3.8504615566361498
7108. hey! mr jack cried	when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes.	5.448482501884564
7109. winston	apologized and quickly set the hat right.	4.913686410369733
7110. then he stood back to look	at mr jack who was pulling on his pigskin gloves.	5.942302666162318
7111. winston enjoyed	seeing him start out; he wore his clothes with style.	4.182602481535312
7112. when he was	going to town nothing was good enough- he had cursed at winston	once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace.	5.210066780124777
7113. at home he wouldn't	even wash his hands for supper and he wandered around the yard	in a pair of sweaty old corduroys.	4.16985125183736
7114. the velvet smoking jackets pearl-gray	wine and blue which miss ada had bought him hung brushed and	unworn in the closet.	4.606164817968128
7115. good-by winston mr jack said	giving a final set to his hat.	4.182602481535312
7116. look out for those movers!	winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car; a handsome	fine-looking man it made him proud to see.	5.030736932667802
7117. after mr jack	drove away winston went on looking out the window.	4.6302305672772395
7118. he noticed a speck	of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger.	5.362099888262211
7119. then he looked	at his finger at the wrinkled heavy knuckle and the thick nail he	used like a knife to pry up slit and open.	3.7138388325869927
7120. for the first time he	let himself be sad about the move.	8.276609835233863
7121. that house was ten years off his life.	5.93315997123781
7122. each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward and he knew how	to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long	glass drops which hung from the chandelier.	4.8189808942195125
7123. he knew the house like	a blind man through his fingers and he did not like to think of all	the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up.	4.090335819440253
7124. ten years	ago he had come to the house to be interviewed.	8.545751248763636
7125. the tulips and the	big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive and he had walked	up from the bus almost singing.	3.496887390241013
7126. miss ada had been out back in a straw	hat planting flowers.	6.316686242097026
7127. she had talked to him right there with the	hot sun in his face which made him sweat and feel ashamed.	4.0796840081685986
7128. winston	had been surprised at her for that.	6.743273855772659
7129. still he had liked the way she	had looked in a fresh neat cotton dress- citron yellow if he remembered.	3.857831188471155
7130. she had had a dignity about her even barefoot and almost too	tan.	7.418982507908433
7131. since then the flowers she had planted had spread all	over the hill.	4.604070314681368
7132. already the jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front	gate and the periwinkles were coming on blue by the porch steps.	5.0749922038732285
7133. in a week the hyacinths would spike out.	6.051824359188902
7134. and the dogwood in early	may for miss ada's alfresco party; and after that the japanese	cherries.	5.8531579429408875
7135. now the yard looked wet and bald the trees bare under their	buds but in a while miss ada's flowers would bloom like a marching	parade.	3.8733459006076134
7136. she had dug a hole for each bulb each tree wore a tag with	her writing on it; where would she go for her gardening now?	5.029102101520793
7137.  somehow	winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes.	4.6724501027054846
7138. sighing	he hurried to the living room.	7.163184125958424
7139. he had a thousand things to see	to.	6.853879193178082
7140. still he couldn't help thinking we're all getting old getting	small; the snail is pulling in her horns.	5.480074734454919
7141. in the living	room miss ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in	her hand.	3.893330820975502
7142. she was looking out at the garden.	9.597101163725537
7143. winston	she said get the basket for the breakables.	4.6724501027054846
7144. winston had	the big straw basket ready in the hall.	6.144814417540349
7145. he brought it in and put	it down beside her.	4.643695188898502
7146. miss ada was looking fine; she had on her easter	suit blue with lavender binding.	5.774229292402387
7147. halfway across the house he	could have smelled her morning perfume.	4.317068102383446
7148. it hung in all her day clothes	sweet and strong; sometimes when he was pressing winston raised	her dresses to his face.	5.748511533331275
7149. frowning miss ada studied the list.	5.219666477665999
7150. the china lemon tree.	6.996493558081793
7151. winston followed her around the room collecting the small frail	objects and wrapping them	in tissue paper.	3.9224302697896576
7152. neither of them trusted the movers.	8.923480449673193
7153. when they	came to mr jack's photograph twenty by twelve inches in a curly	silver frame miss ada said by rights i ought to leave that	seeing he won't take my clotheshorse.	3.4928243944462
7154. she smiled at winston	and he saw the hateful hard glitter in her eyes.	6.366648870202475
7155. he picked up the photograph	and began to wrap it.	5.352693982417627
7156. at least you could leave it	for the movers miss ada said.	6.861283181203918
7157. what possessed you to tell me	a clotheshorse would be a good idea?	5.609668075795624
7158.    winston folded the	tissue paper carefully.	7.712079578137997
7159. he's used it every day; every morning	i lay out his clothes on it.	3.9701983041559052
7160. and it was his main present! leave that fool picture out she added	sharply.	7.252932180477076
7161. winston laid it in the basket.	6.450107449128842
7162. mr jack sets	store by that.	8.639539550016586
7163. it was meant to be	my present.	6.050103971507023
7164. but she went on down the list.	7.979681423433581
7165. winston was	relieved; those presents had been on his mind.	4.660109175710778
7166. he had only agreed	with miss ada about getting the valet but he had actually suggested	the photograph to mr jack.	5.7990338016164715
7167. you know what she likes winston	he had said wearily one evening in november when winston was	pulling off his overshoes.	4.065267897024728
7168. tell me what to get her for christmas.	6.669475569795073
7169. she's been talking about a picture winston had told	him.	4.722433537019863
7170. picture! you mean picture of me?	7.163184125958424
7171.  but winston	had persuaded him.	6.929258860693999
7172. on christmas night they had had a disagreement	about it.	8.12251889750694
7173. winston had heard because he was setting up the	liquor tray in the next room.	4.738038115679018
7174. through the door he had seen mr jack	walking around waiting for miss ada.	6.255463197224489
7175. finally she had come down;	winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk	hostess gown.	3.8922489172472488
7176. how do you like it?	10.58447200496461
7177.  she had asked.	9.732567059290867
7178. mr jack had said you look about fifteen years old.	6.37319773496571
7179. is that a compliment?	9.59375794177552
7180.    i don't know.	11.067037043475061
7181. he had	stood at a little distance studying her as though he would walk around	next and look at the back of her head.	4.368728485491728
7182. lovie you make	me feel naked.	7.712079578137997
7183. miss ada had giggled and she went sweeping and rustling	to the couch and sank down.	4.1093085223175905
7184. you look like that picture	i have at the office mr jack had started.	6.522366612295051
7185. not a line	not a wrinkle.	7.570963450787933
7186. i look like an old man compared and he had picked	up his photograph with the red christmas bow still on it.	5.538923657923647
7187. will you wear pink when you're sixty?	5.881370450938728
7188.    darling	i love that photograph.	8.457718703298294
7189. i'm going to put it on my dresser.	5.058971579308086
7190. i guess it's children make a woman old.	6.9995046480612055
7191. a man gets	old anyhow.	7.593329570937129
7192. after a minute he went on people must think the	curse is on me seeing you fresh as an apple and me old and gray.	5.273948367287777
7193. i'll give you a medical certificate framed if you like	miss ada had said.	4.205690870727386
7194. all i want is a picture- with	a few lines.	6.83890270659942
7195. make the man put them in if he has to.	4.91493314788037
7196. after	that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word.	5.927513947010463
7197. then miss	ada had stood up rustling and rustling and gone upstairs.	4.521022108713427
7198. was it love?	12.743574359188564
7199.  i had no doubt that it was.	7.319784342420116
7200. during the rest of the summer	my scholarly mania for making plaster casts and spatter prints of	catskill flowers and leaves was all but surpassed by the constantly	renewed impressions of jessica that my mind served up to me for contemplation	and delight.	4.813035605881516
7201. nothing in all the preceding years had	had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than	the breakup of camp the packing away of my camp uniforms the severing	of ties with the six or ten people i had grown most to love in the	world.	3.471302462681749
7202. in final separation from them in the railroad terminal across	the river from new york i would nearly cry.	6.066172071853832
7203. my parents' welcoming	arms would seem woeful inadequate unwanted.	5.2063673323678
7204. but that year was	different for just as the city in the form of my street clothes had	intruded upon my mountain nights so an essential part of the summer	gave promise of continuing into the fall: jessica and i about to	be separated not by a mere footbridge or messhall kitchen but by the	immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs had agreed	to correspond.	4.839760922288098
7205. these letters became the center of my existence.	6.306123818176722
7206. i lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock	myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth	time and finally prepare an answer.	5.122899888114368
7207. my memory has catalogued for easy	reference and withdrawal the image of her pink scented stationery and	the unsloped almost printed configurations of her neat studious handwriting	with which she invited me to recall our summer so many sentences	beginning with remember when h; and others concerning	camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood and news of her	commencing again her piano lessons her private school a visit to	boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned	on furlough wounded from the war in europe.	3.1072182531406995
7208. in my letters	i took on a personality that differed from the self i knew in real	life.	5.961749108056919
7209. then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting	cables and communiques full of dash and wit and glamor quoting	from the books i read imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended	by a teacher in whose special after-school class i was enrolled.	3.2261301576496124
7210. the letters took their source from a stream of my imagination	in which i was transformed into a young man not unlike my bunkmate eliot	sands- he of the porch steps anecdotes- who smoked cigarettes	performed the tango wore fifty dollar suits and sneaked off into	the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them.	4.19415444123964
7211. like eliot	in my fantasies i had a proud bearing and with a skill that was vaguely	continental i would lead jessica through an evening of dancing	and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits would guide her gently	to the night's climax which in my dreams was always represented	by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep moist kisses	burning with love.	3.2319387549243666
7212. the night after reading her letter about her surgeon	uncle- it must have been late in september- i had a vision	of myself returned in ragged uniform from the front nearly dying	my head bandaged and blooded and jessica bending over me the power	of her love bringing me back to life.	4.464643572756302
7213. for many nights afterward the	idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return	and fill me with obscure and painful desires would cause me to lie	awake in shame tossing with irresolution longing to fall into a deep	sleep.	3.3772360614035932
7214. the weeks went by and the longer our separation grew	the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became.	4.653079438027171
7215. they	caused my love for jessica to become warmer and at the same time more	hopeless as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever	bring me the courage to ask to see her again.	3.746694232957261
7216. as it turned out	jessica took matters	into her own hands.	7.8101580883983495
7217. having received permission	to give a camp reunion-halloween party she asked that i come and	be her date.	3.9968475856044186
7218. i went and mum and nervous all but made a fool of myself.	5.8617133059367985
7219. again among those jubilantly reunited bunkmates i was shy with	jessie and acted as i had during those early saturday mornings when	we all seemed to be playing for effect to be detached and unconcerned	with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom later in	the privacy of our bunks we would think in terms of the most elaborate	romance.	3.568690195345826
7220. i remember standing in a corner watching jessica act the	hostess serving soft drinks to her guests.	5.778990623326683
7221. she was wearing her dark	hair in two thick braids to attain an american girl effect	she thought was appropriate to halloween.	3.882743409792677
7222. it made her look sweet and	schoolgirlish i was excited to be with her but i did not know how	to express it.	5.777187253930243
7223. yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous	letter writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages out	of my mind and plant himself in reality.	3.5950532385385463
7224. it was late we were playing	kissing games and jessica and i were called on to kiss in front	of the others.	5.3286079586594814
7225. we blushed and were flustered and it turned out to	be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek.	4.18008606573972
7226. the kiss outraged our friends	but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote exciting	premonitions of lust all the mysterious sensations that i had	imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me.	4.256465043155141
7227. it was	at that party that finally overcoming my timidity inspired by tales	only half-understood and overheard among older boys i asked jessie	to spend new year's eve with me.	3.502360079975536
7228. lovingly she accepted and so	great was my emotion that all i could think of saying was you're	amazing you know?	4.920292053327142
7229.  later we agreed to think of how we wished	to spend that night.	5.382425438420556
7230. we would write to one another and make a definite	plan.	8.345253665788157
7231. among my school and neighborhood	friends during the next months i bragged and swaggered and	pompously described my impending date.	3.9911523167369287
7232. but though i boasted and gave	off a dapper front i was beneath it all frightened.	5.778177079234764
7233. it would be the	first time i had ever been completely alone with a girl i loved.	4.50974049010604
7234. i had no idea of what subjects one discussed when alone with a girl	or how one behaved: should i hold her hand while walking or only	when crossing the street?	5.100374015847066
7235.  should i bring along a corsage or send	one to her?	4.766660425888381
7236.  was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city?	7.259093219246307
7237. 	should i accompany her to the door of her home or should i ask to	be invited in?	3.9296689099644335
7238.  in or out should i kiss her goodnight?	6.7790825342916845
7239.  all this	was unknown to me and yet i had dared to ask her out for the most	important night of the year!   when in one letter jessica informed	me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone	on new year's eve i knew for a moment an immense relief; but	the letter went on: she had cried she had implored she had been miserable	at his refusal and finally he had relented- and now how happy	she was how expectant!   her optimism gave me heart.	3.1615230037966726
7240. i forced	confidence into myself.	9.645886477709713
7241. i made inquiries i read a book of etiquette.	4.85486375821358
7242. in december i wrote her with authority that we would meet	on the steps of the hotel astor a rendezvous spot that i had learned	was the most sophisticated.	4.967695730290886
7243. we would attend a film and later on	i stated we might go to the mayflower coffee shop or child's	or toffenetti's for waffles.	4.118814632699469
7244. i set the hour of our meeting for seven.	6.844554840485109
7245. at five o'clock that night it was already dark and behind	my closed door i was dressing as carefully as a groom.	3.784333558833476
7246. i wore a new	double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design	and wide lapels like a devil's ears.	5.229423512520904
7247. my camp-made leather wallet bulky	with twisted raised stitches around the edges i stuffed with money	i had been saving.	3.8535574057241324
7248. hatless in an overcoat of rough blue wool	i was given a proud farewell by my mother and father and i set out	into the strangely still streets of brooklyn.	4.53629749905402
7249. i felt superior to the	neighborhood friends i was leaving behind felt older than my years	and was full of compliments for myself as i headed into the subway that	was carrying its packs of passengers out of that dull borough and	into the unstable tantalizing excitement of manhattan.	3.252052035882555
7250. times	square when i ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers	dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant	was nearly impassable the sidewalks swarming with celebrants	with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls	and their rationed bottles of whiskey.	4.413067049056792
7251. heavy-coated severe-looking	policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the	revellers from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic.	3.999474334752898
7252. the night	was cold but the crowd kept one warm.	5.4678654398730995
7253. the giant electric signs and	marquees were lit up for the first time since blackout regulations had	been instituted and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that	victory was just around the corner.	3.6996513130744604
7254. cardboard noisemakers substitutes	for the unavailable tin models were being hawked and bought at makeshift	stands every few yards along broadway and one's ears were continually	serenaded by the horns' rasps and bleats.	4.481223380679198
7255. an old gentlemen	next to me held a boy scout bugle to his lips and blasted away at	every fourth step and during the interim shouted out v for victory!	his neighbors cheered him on.	3.4240324805631874
7256. there was a great sense of	camaraderie.	11.95037893269919
7257. how did one join them?	7.3171429565299055
7258.  where were they all walking	to?	9.393876811334966
7259.  was i supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for jessica?	4.630345978788687
7260. 	it was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the	other gallants who had established the astor steps as the beach-head	from which to launch their night of merrymaking.	4.699543674437037
7261. i looked over their	faces and felt a twinge: they all looked so much more knowing than	i.	4.027694403002068
7262. i looked for jessica to materialize out of the	clogging curdling crowd and as the time passed and i waited a fiend	came to life beside me and whispered in my ear: how was i planning	to greet jessica?	4.8879308417625476
7263.  where exactly would we go after the movie?	5.417509618315117
7264. 	suppose the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we	couldn't get in?	6.156116826973542
7265.  suppose i hadn't brought along enough money?	5.520402284828592
7266. 	i felt for my wallet.	7.712079578137997
7267. its thick substantial outline calmed me.	5.940741374880009
7268. but when i saw that it was already ten past seven i began to	wonder if something had gone wrong.	6.385691246579157
7269. suppose her father had changed his	mind and had refused to let her leave?	4.816050849652839
7270.  suppose at this very moment	her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans?	6.098893627095205
7271. 	i grew uneasy.	6.939425769494729
7272. all about me there was a hectic interplay of meetings	taking place like abrupt jerky scenes in old silent movies joyous	greetings and beginnings huggings and kissings enthusiastic forays	into the festive night.	4.966270627859343
7273. whole platoons were taking up new positions on	the steps arriving and departing while i stayed glued like a signpost	to one spot.	3.5999718489366903
7274. at 7:25 two hotel doormen came thumping	down the steps carrying a saw-horse to be set up as a barricade in front	of the haberdashery store window next to the entranceway and as i	watched them in their gaudy red coats that nearly scraped the ground	their golden fringed epaulets and spic red-visored caps i suddenly	saw just over their shoulders jessica gracefully making her way through	the crowd.	4.469785234734975
7275. my heart almost stopped beating.	6.491748007815632
7276. there were thirty-eight patients on the bus the morning i left	for hanover most of them disturbed and hallucinating.	6.204235237076277
7277. an interne	a nurse and two attendants were in charge of us.	5.088912068018233
7278. i felt lonely	and depressed as i stared out the bus window at chicago's grim	dirty west side.	5.414283180562327
7279. it seemed incredible as i listened to the monotonous	drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients	that technically i was a ward of the state of illinois going to	a hospital for the mentally ill.	3.959065088205088
7280. i suddenly thought of mary	jane brennan the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger her quiet	competence the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the	surface of her defenses.	4.65380753899324
7281. we had become good friends during my	stay at cook county hospital.	4.924527902045801
7282. i had told her enough about myself	to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appeared in local newspapers	after my little adventure in marshall field + co.	4.987235719139363
7283. she	knew that i lived at a good address on the gold coast that i had	once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university	to finish my medical studies.	3.443914173290266
7284. she knew also that i was unmarried	and without a single known relative.	6.429857783138903
7285. she wasn't quite sure that	i felt enough remorse about my drinking or that i would not return	to it once i was out and on my own again.	3.791399472748607
7286. i read those newspaper stories about you she had said.	6.385550640529422
7287. you	must have loved that girl very much but you couldn't have meant	it when you said that you wanted to kill her.	3.5033994744337345
7288. why do you	say that?	10.554735562402183
7289.  i asked.	9.686204316035266
7290. i was full of booze and well a drunk	is apt to do anything he says he'll do.	6.072334714223389
7291. nonsense! i grew	up in an irish neighborhood on chicago's west side.	4.182602481535312
7292. don't	tell me about drunks.	8.457718703298294
7293. you're not the kind to go violent.	4.913686410369733
7294. were you	in love with that girl?	7.163184125958424
7295.    would it make any difference to	you if i were mary jane?	4.883658315714343
7296.    she met my eyes suddenly	angry.	8.754158004923722
7297. i wouldn't have gone into nursing if i didn't care about	people.	4.779259545604254
7298. i'm interested in every patient i've helped take care	of.	6.144814417540349
7299. when i think of people like you well i-   you	what mary jane?	4.792138319025392
7300.    you are young intelligent have a	whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself but	you mess it up with whiskey indifference self-destructive attitudes.	5.129886907342214
7301. i don't blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you.	4.486358857710431
7302. was	she pretty?	11.155741451300253
7303.    oh yes i said feeling annoyed	she was very pretty.	4.939831152453617
7304. you don't believe that i'm going back to	medical school and finish do you?	6.193786237805537
7305.    why	should i?	8.12896173865557
7306.  i've	worked this ward for three months now.	7.053231933431298
7307. we keep getting the same	ones back again and again.	4.923505112361707
7308. they all mean well have great promises to	make when they are about to go home but drinking is their sickness.	5.757017679781961
7309. you've not seemed like them but maybe you are.	4.477601198394805
7310. you've treated	your stay here like a big joke.	6.412214371980113
7311. it's not a joke to be sent to a place	like this or to hanover.	4.187700429308475
7312. i wanted to go to college to-	why didn't you?	8.798156110365664
7313.  i asked.	9.686204316035266
7314. chicago has some of the best-	her eyes flashed angrily.	8.356785796467602
7315. that's what i mean about	you anderson she said.	4.6724501027054846
7316. you don't seem to know much about	reality.	8.674111249632956
7317. i'll tell you why i didn't go to college; i'm	the oldest of six children.	3.8849121559715263
7318. my father's a policeman and makes less	than seven thousand dollars a year.	6.256722695259412
7319. there was no money for tuition	for clothes for all the things you apparently take for granted.	4.781888401711541
7320. nurses'	training here doesn't cost anything.	7.712079578137997
7321. they even pay me six dollars	a month.	5.295767400278317
7322. i think it's a good deal.	9.317758002168013
7323. i'm going to become a good	nurse and i've got two baby brothers that are going to have college	if i have to work at my profession until i'm an old maid to give	it to them.	3.892083469184372
7324. do you have a boy friend?	12.334905042798287
7325.  i asked.	9.686204316035266
7326. that's none of your business she said then changed	the subject.	6.136217033603553
7327. what about your father and mother don't you think	of them when you're in a place like this?	3.9659404198633346
7328.    my father	and mother died when i was two years old i said.	6.608243029318644
7329. aunt mary died when i was doing my military service.	4.7705608764064875
7330. i have	no one but myself to worry about.	6.9995046480612055
7331. something in my voice must	have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly and she	turned away to keep me from seeing her face.	3.586519222272127
7332. i don't know what i'd do without my family.	6.887110893493336
7333. we've	always been so close.	6.162967476035402
7334. tell me more about them.	7.8480720608357215
7335. her	eyes became bright as she talked about her father and mother aunts	and uncles cousins.	4.096141198540458
7336. listening i felt cheated and lonely as only an	orphan can.	5.9245075971793435
7337. when she had finished i said:   your dad sounds	like a good father and a good policeman.	4.48125543490048
7338. i'll bet he wouldn't	be pleased if a rumdum like me were to ask his daughter for a date-	i mean after i'm out of the hospital a month or so from now.	4.810434870411506
7339. my father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached	to homicide for five years.	4.476028842181714
7340. he's a pretty good judge of character	anderson.	7.274296728371497
7341. i don't think he'd mind too much if he were sure you'd	decided not to be a rumdum in the future.	4.844868852434226
7342. what about	you?	14.422460152990045
7343.  how would you feel about it if i were to ask you for a date	when i get through at hanover?	3.8972166892833284
7344.    if i thought you	were serious about going back to school that you'd learned something	from your experiences here and at hanover- well i might consider	such an offer.	4.988352459833065
7345. what about your h that girl you were going to kill?	5.075872056398874
7346. 	it suddenly seemed very important to me that mary jane	brennan should know the truth about me- that i was not the confused	sick irresponsible person she believed me to be.	5.176792748296004
7347. there	are things about me that i can't tell you now mary jane i	said but if you'll go out to dinner with me when i get out of hanover	i'd like to tell you the whole story.	3.6564081407767133
7348. i can say this: i'm	dead serious about going back to school.	6.717211954254491
7349. as for that other girl	let's just say that i never want to see her again.	4.6049980428980035
7350. you will get	to come home on long weekends from hanover won't you?	6.671483626992527
7351. 	yes i'll get one overnight a month.	4.913686410369733
7352. we'll go up	to the edgewater beach hotel for dinner i said.	5.739974350684024
7353. do you like	to dance?	8.362335660641696
7354.  they always have a good orchestra.	8.665654035455875
7355. i like	to dance she said then turned and walked away.	4.653836632802373
7356. there hadn't	been anything really personal in her interest in me.	7.0556910555954415
7357. it was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward	and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there.	4.12908428813935
7358. now riding this hospital bus feeling isolated and utterly	alone i knew that she was genuine and unique quite unlike any girl	i had known before.	5.347352065900152
7359. it seemed the most important thing in my life	at this moment that she should know the real truth about me.	4.24902532480029
7360. it	was a fantastic story.	9.460831057446654
7361. only two people in the state of illinois knew	that i was entering hanover state hospital under an assumed name	or why.	4.966414685466329
7362. it was unlikely that any girl as sharp as mary jane brennan	would believe it without proof.	5.53186932444105
7363. but i had the proof all documented	in a legal agreement which i would show her the moment i was free	to do so.	3.9795036334990876
7364. as the bus turned into the main highway and headed	toward hanover i settled back in my seat and closed my eyes thinking	over the events of the past two weeks trying to put the pieces in	order.	5.33374448837059
7365. i wondered suddenly as i listened to the disconnected jabberings	coming from the patient behind me if i had not perhaps imagined	it all.	4.202077795409469
7366. perhaps this was reality and dale nelson the actor was	delusion; a figment of carl anderson's imagination.	5.954046405456975
7367. i	had come to chicago from new york early in september with a dramatic	production called ask tony.	4.1386168575659035
7368. it was a bad play real grade-a	turkey which only a prevalence of angels with grandiose dreams of	capital gain and tax money to burn could have put into rehearsal.	4.993122674200371
7369. no	one not even the producer had any real hope of getting it back to broadway.	4.281619005265339
7370. but because it was a suspense gangster story of the capone	era many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in chicago continue	as a road company and eventually become a movie.	5.648291874108059
7371. such optimism	was completely unjustified.	7.595074994918409
7372. the critics literally screamed their	indignation.	6.5155523300336915
7373. ask tony was doomed from the moment kupcinet leveled	on it in his sun-times column.	4.481243867462061
7374. we opened on friday and	closed the following monday.	7.106778255050199
7375. out of the entire cast i alone received	good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer.	5.024372671439475
7376. this let me	in for a lot of kidding from the rest of the company two members of	which were native chicagoans.	6.629349961081481
7377. we were paid off tuesday morning	and given tickets back to new york.	4.705280188322822
7378. i felt lonely and depressed	as i packed my bags at the croydon hotel.	5.794496086763905
7379. it seemed to me that	my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another.	5.1108771948866405
7380. i	had been among the top third in my class at nyu had wanted	desperately to go to medical school but i'd run out of money and	energy at the same time.	5.322127439670454
7381. then later i had quit my safe secure five-a-week	spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play.	3.9882979691596354
7382. it	seemed to me that i was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well.	6.804309631906611
7383. i	knew that i'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital	or as a counterman at union news or schraffts while waiting for another	acting job to open.	3.305507658629995
7384. it suddenly occurred to me that i did not particularly	like acting that i was at some sort of crossroads and would	have to decide soon what i was going to do with my life.	6.113533683022482
7385. i	closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy	to pick up then went to the bathroom for a drink of water.	3.787716196695935
7386. when i answered it a voice too dignified and british to	be real said is this mr dale nelson the actor?	5.430843899480805

7396.    yes of course mr	nelson.	10.409583009979668
7397. i started to say something else appropriate but	the man had hung up.	4.6431421997854505
7398. i finally went downstairs to the bar off	the main lobby where most of the cast were drowning their sorrows over	the untimely passing of ask tony.	5.540293989085241
7399. they all bowed low as i approached	them.	5.468376011798721

7406. mr wycoff's car is waiting	for you at the east entrance.	6.436957007084835
7407. i followed him out through the	lobby to the street.	4.930385829394837
7408. an ancient rolls-royce as shiningly	impressive as the day it came off the ship was parked at the curb.	5.560462497293669
7409. the	elderly chauffeur immaculate in a dark uniform stood stiffly at attention	holding open the door of the town car.	4.054145959013875
7410. i was giving the parked cars the once-over.	7.7291331826012915
7411. the oldsmobile with	the license number jyj 114 was in stall number five.	3.700289227276755
7412. okay i said to the attendant i'll let you know if i close	the deal on the office in this building.	5.331533487668011
7413. i walked with	him back to the entrance.	6.869184353226598
7414. he gave me a ticket on the agency car and	parked it.	6.843073868154478
7415. i was back in ten minutes.	6.531156083889578
7416. forgot to get something	out of the car i told him showing him my ticket.	6.045857176492527
7417. he	started to say something as i walked in and then suddenly grinned and	said oh yes.	3.877025235983369
7418. you're the one i was talking to about a monthly	rental.	6.378230372198069
7419. that's right i told him.	5.619635421798327
7420. he consulted	the parking ticket then looked at a notation and said you're	in the third row back toward the rear.	5.14467250288261
7421. can you find it all right?	6.606571534721279
7422. 	sure i told him.	8.457718703298294
7423. i went back to the agency	car and got out an electric bug one of the newest devices for electronic	shadowing.	4.846907312005633
7424. i always keep a set in the car.	7.238129828299063
7425. i put in new	batteries so as to be certain i'd have plenty of power and on my way	out walked over to the regular parking stalls and stood looking at	them thoughtfully.	4.328875186906202
7426. i waited until the parking attendant was busy	with a customer then slipped around the back of the car with license	number jym 114 attached the electronic bug to the rear bumper	and walked out.	4.995801290526188
7427. the attendant waved me on.	4.747750369463677
7428. one of the	hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street trying	to make himself inconspicuous keeping an eye on the entrance of	an office building and waiting.	5.133687007296248
7429. for the first fifteen or twenty	minutes it's possible to be more or less interested in window displays	then in people passing by.	4.926587423044235
7430. after a while however a person's	mind gets fed up and that magnifies all of the disagreeable physical	symptoms which go with that sort of an assignment.	5.799747117352949
7431. you want to sit down.	8.735047426985277
7432. your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary.	7.20720629969893
7433. you're conscious	of the fact that your feet hurt that the city pavements are hard.	4.946791304247302
7434. i waited a solid two hours before my man came out of the office	building.	6.793469924855907
7435. i wasn't far behind him when	he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car.	4.053408509875919
7436. the attendant	recognized me once more and said what did you do about that	office?	4.983240996215937
7437.    i haven't made up my mind yet i said.	4.85486375821358
7438. i have a couple of them i'm figuring on;	one here and one that's out quite a ways where there's usually curb	parking.	6.089487059760877
7439. that curb parking is undependable and annoying	particularly when it rains he said.	4.491700615163783
7440. i kept trying to	get him to take my money.	6.952937799678256
7441. i'm in a rush	right now.	5.619635421798327
7442. i know where the car is.	9.073234848338988
7443. want me to drive it out?	5.219666477665999
7444. 	i'll have one of the boys get it he said.	7.86790372899371
7445. it's	one	of the rules on transients.	5.619635421798327
7446. regulars drive out their own cars.	7.163184125958424
7447. make it as snappy as you can will you?	5.707815920182424
7448.  i asked.	13.29281579470557
7449. oh that's all right he said.	5.930747801191029
7450. you're going to be a regular.	11.649803438840122
7451. you'll get in the office building here.	5.1332288657822085
7452. you don't want to	lease a place way out in the sticks.	7.780163745394636
7453. you get business where the business	is not where it isn't.	5.041587404040665
7454. i grinned at him handed him	a couple of dollars and said by the time you get the parking charge	figured up there should be a cigar in it for you.	5.862172948333005
7455. i hurried	over to the agency heap jumped in started the motor and was just	in time to see the car i wanted to shadow turn to the left.	3.987395067937704
7456. i was held up a bit trying to make a left turn.	8.076603447196666
7457. by the time i'd	made it he was gone.	6.6865004531687315
7458. i turned on the	electric bug and the signal came in loud and clear.	5.855193473523447
7459. i made	time and picked him up within ten blocks.	4.85486375821358
7460. i stayed half a block behind	him letting lots of cars keep in between us listening to the steady	beep h beep h beep.	5.051091177800501
7461. after fifteen minutes of traffic driving	he turned to the left.	5.226259304683428
7462. i couldn't see him but the electric bugging	device gave steady beeps when it was straight ahead short half	beeps when the car i was following was to the left and long drawn-out	beeps when it turned to the right.	4.88935824566732
7463. if it ever got behind me the beep	turned to a buzz.	5.0751678742754445
7464. i turned left too soon and got a signal showing	that i was still behind him but he was to the right.	5.983859436892435
7465. after a	while the signal became a buzz and i knew he was behind me.	4.364368697299414
7466. that meant	he'd parked someplace.	10.309336113069524
7467. i made a big circle until i located the	car parked at the curb in front of an apartment house.	4.291541872620843
7468. i found	a parking place half a block away sat in the car and waited.	5.838385652203073
7469. my quarry was in the apartment house for two hours.	5.831806498656852
7470. then he came out	and started driving toward the beach.	7.406742940604458
7471. by this time it was dark.	7.483484634123906
7472. i could get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop	far behind when there wasn't traffic.	5.544824657336877
7473. my lights would have been a	giveaway if i'd tried to shadow him in the conventional manner.	4.924544742526757
7474. moreover	i'd have lost him if it hadn't been for the electronic shadowing	device h.	5.938109610192063
7475. his signal was coming loud and clear and then all	of a sudden it turned to a buzz.	3.807625650973218
7476. i circled the block and found he was	in the parking lot of a high-class restaurant.	5.6874976549253144
7477. i sat where	i could watch the exit and realized i was hungry.	4.344767340770036
7478. i sat there with	the faint odor of charcoal-broiled steaks tantalizing my nostrils and	occasionally catching the aroma of coffee.	5.229423512520904
7479. my man came out an	hour later drove to the beach turned right and after half a mile went	to the swim and tan motel.	3.7598557005602466
7480. it was a fairly modern motel with	quite a bit of electrical display in front.	7.069746307766418
7481. i remembered it was the	peeping tom place.	5.406629921006237
7482. i waited until my man was coming out of	the office with the key to a cabin before i went in to register.	5.515976226084273
7483. the card the man i was shadowing had filled out was still on the	counter.	3.570845587849075
7484. i noticed that he was in unit 12 and that he had registered	under the name of oscar l palmer and wife giving a san francisco	address.	6.797836097563465
7485. he had written out the license number of his car	but had transposed the last two figures an old dodge which is still	good.	3.926229288813968
7486. ninety-nine times out of a hundred the motel manager doesn't	check the license number on the plates against the license number the	tenant writes out.	5.309098227257833
7487. if he does it's still better than an even chance	he won't notice the transposition of the numbers and if he should	notice it the thing can be passed off as an honest mistake.	3.5353044223133936
7488. i used the alias of robert c richards gave the first three letters	and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency	heap but a couple of phony numbers in between.	5.404231825336364
7489. i could have	written anything.	7.910931711324917
7490. the manager of the motel was a woman who apparently	didn't care.	6.372552587080492
7491. she was complying with the law in regard to registrations	but she certainly wasn't checking license numbers or bothering	the tenants.	4.286246591493219
7492. you mean you're all alone mr richards?	8.219551235553068
7493. 	that's right.	8.12896173865557
7494. your wife isn't going	to join you- later?	7.6602715472761425
7495.    i don't think so.	7.307651568093202
7496. if	you expect her to show up she said you'd better put 'and	wife' on there.	5.529648191384721
7497. it's a formality you know.	6.134170937682657
7498. any	difference in the rate?	8.457718703298294
7499.  i asked.	9.686204316035266
7500. not to you she said	smiling.	9.985899627480322
7501. it's ten dollars either way.	5.619635421798327
7502. there are ice cubes in	a container at the far end and in another by the office.	5.998588662810528
7503. there are	three soft-drink vending machines and if you should be joined by- anybody-	try to keep things quiet if you will.	4.289073635828135
7504. we like to run a nice	quiet place.	7.543900632520252
7505. thank you i told her.	6.431186339011471
7506. i took	another sidelong glance at the other registration card then took the	key to unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park	the car.	5.180662325158179
7507. the construction was reasonably solid; not like	the cracker-box construction of so many of the motel units that have stucco	all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear	every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment.	3.8313304880042423
7508. i	put a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side i wanted	to case.	5.990983397112459
7509. with the aid of that i could hear my man moving around heard	him cough a couple of times heard the toilet flush heard the sound	of water running.	4.2070899549848
7510. whoever his companion was going to be she	was going to join him later.	6.926958355105983
7511. she knew where to come.	6.386493532495508
7512. he didn't have	to telephone.	8.978600574448244
7513. i was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of	communication had been severed.	4.528649464337899
7514. it's one thing to go without food	when you're occupied with some work or when you're simply postponing	a meal but when you're dependent on someone else and know that you	can't eat until he's bedded down for the night hunger can	be a gnawing torture.	4.31072423143298
7515. i had noticed a drive-in down the road a	quarter of a mile.	4.7355608766196955
7516. the batteries on the bugging device i had put on	the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong signals.	4.524741011976274
7517. the	powerful microphone i could press against the wall between my motel	unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation	and i was positively nauseated i was so hungry.	3.5452967492743404
7518. i	got in the car drove down to the drive-in and ordered a couple of hamburgers	with everything included a cup of coffee and the fastest service	possible.	5.609575161841561
7519. the place wasn't particularly busy at that time	of night and the girl who was waiting on me who was clothed in the	tightest-fitting pair of slacks i had ever seen on a woman and a sweater	that showed everything there was- and there was lots of it- wanted	to be sociable.	3.2148933095616328
7520. you really in a hurry handsome?	8.905968506206458
7521. 	she asked.	8.12896173865557
7522. i'm in a hurry beautiful.	7.712079578137997
7523. it's	early in the evening to be in a hurry.	5.7467184775053095
7524. there's lots of time left.	7.712079578137997
7525. there may not be any women left i said.	6.606071821851671
7526. she gave	a little pout and said i don't get off work until eleven	o'clock.	5.830243309177054
7527. that's when my evening commences.	5.749184924812366
7528. i'll	be here at ten-fifty-five i said.	7.163184125958424
7529. that's what they all say.	5.619635421798327
7530. what's that thing going	buzz-buzz-buzz in your car?	6.743273855772659
7531.    i said darn it that's	the automatic signal that shows when the ignition key is on.	4.024400784865828
7532. i didn't	turn it off.	9.645886477709713
7533. i reached over and switched off the electronic bugging	device.	4.85486375821358
7534. she went in to get the hamburgers and i switched	on the device again and kept the signal from dowling's car coming	in steady and clear until i saw her starting back with the hamburgers.	5.028112331412147
7535. then i shut off the device again.	6.094484305286484
7536. she wanted to hang around	while i was eating.	7.057872112361533
7537. don't you think it's selfish to have	dinner before you go to pick her up?	3.8849121559715263
7538.    no i said.	11.941367711978117
7539. it's a kindness to her.	6.134170937682657
7540. you see she's on a diet.	8.897605023917958
7541. she'll	eat just a pineapple and cottage cheese salad and i'm to have one	with her so she won't feel out of place.	3.5033994744337345
7542. diets can be	terrible the girl said.	7.163184125958424
7543. how much overweight is she?	7.504076672680376
7544. 	not a bit i said but she's keeping her figure in hand.	5.583228874976599
7545. she looked at me provocatively.	6.649802464411546
7546. good figures should	be kept in hand she said and walked away with an exaggerated	wiggle.	5.713221870242838
7547. i turned on the device again half fearful that i might	find silence but the buzzes came in loud and clear.	3.727743303832435
7548. when i	switched on the lights for her to come and get the check i had the	exact change plus a dollar tip.	5.21156189859749
7549. the fat man said all we gotta do is go around the corner.	4.151208772786439
7550. the thin man said that-a-way.	6.5155523300336915
7551. second building on the right.	6.964781304336638
7552. it says police	right on the door.	8.688145586117127
7553. so even if we was as dumb as you	take us for we could still find it.	4.226265922584427
7554. roberta and dave began	to back toward the door.	6.711571524058882
7555. the thin man waved the gun again.	4.280553672808819
7556. he said	right around the corner.	8.132854117812016
7557. it says water works but	there is a policeman on duty too.	4.756935259683712
7558. a night policeman just	like in the states.	6.970112941749264
7559. you know?	11.68952670743481
7560.    canada doesn't have	much of this here juvenile delinquency problem but we keep a night	policeman all the same on account of the crazy tourists.	5.097918297646739
7561. at	the door dave paused to feel for the latch.	5.138927395482462
7562. roberta glanced up at	her husband.	7.712079578137997
7563. he was going to be sensible and not try to do anything	rash with that gun pointed at him.	4.744162202012163
7564. she measured the distance from where	they stood to the men and the gun measured the distance from the	men to the back room.	5.487005832606573
7565. she decided to risk it.	6.386493532495508
7566. there was something phony	about all this gun waving- something not quite what it seemed in	the detailed directions for finding the police.	5.32076124587254
7567. dave had the	latch under his thumb now and he removed his arm from his wife in order	to pull the door open.	3.6365249602168035
7568. in a flash she was away to the back paying	no attention to three angry shouts from the male throats.	5.489769158334665
7569. she tore open	the back door.	6.386493532495508
7570. it was dark inside the room but enough light spilled	from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table	with a green cloth top.	4.7895486065345905
7571. there was a small sideboard with some empty	beer bottles on it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs.	4.899435031616594
7572. slowly	she turned to face the men again.	7.047141756911831
7573. rat-face at the counter was on his	feet.	4.913686410369733
7574. the distance between where she stood and where dave waited at	the outside door was a hundred miles.	4.793469620857245
7575. keeping her frightened gaze on	the men at the counter she began to feel her way to the door.	4.048524367879484
7576. she	sidled along the booths one step at a time.	6.144814417540349
7577. as she reached dave and felt his arm go around her felt him pull	her to the safety of his person she knew with the certainty of despair	that something bad had happened to lauren.	3.4902421864623294
7578. the two	men watched as dave closed the door behind them watched them cross the	sidewalk to their car.	4.705010556909502
7579. the fat man removed	his apron put on a greasy and wrinkled jacket and zipped it over his	paunch.	3.836051331867531
7580. the thin man moved swiftly to the phone and dialed a	number.	5.187735111958531
7581. when he was answered he said albert?	7.055965131026462

7584. got it?	11.155741451300253
7585.    he turned from the phone and strode to	the front of the restaurant.	5.076917712328401
7586. the white buick hadn't moved away yet.	6.805370004451517
7587. a line of worry formed a twitch pulled his mouth over to one	side.	3.937766358631689
7588. he said grosse?	13.575177224286971
7589.  you ain't kidding me- the	kid don't know the name of this town?	5.492315596375089

7593. howda i know?	6.939425769494729
7594. 	remember how she looked when barney held the door for her?	5.739974350684024
7595. 	kinda like a zombie?	6.162967476035402
7596.  she was just waking up when we found her at	the garage.	7.090095238441496
7597. stupid fools- ain't got	enough brains between the two of you-   grosse muttered his	head down one hand playing with the zipper on his jacket.	3.696557664209644
7598. had	enough brains to call ya up so as ya could do sompin about it when the	parents- i coulda let her go go- his eyes were lowered so	he couldn't have seen the narrow pointed face of his companion suddenly	writhe with fury; but he was aware of it just the same.	4.459231319471732
7599. he knew	vince steiner was one of those men who had to work up a fury once	in a while just to prove how dangerous he could be.	4.279004945735915
7600. with a curse	vince seized the thing nearest a glass sugar container with a spouted	metal top and threw it against the wall opposite.	5.276716207364498
7601. the heavy glass	didn't break but the top flew off; sugar sprayed with a hiss	that was loud in the silence.	3.442577200311323
7602. not really startled but careful	to appear so grosse sucked noisily on his pipe.	6.052366586094059
7603. why does everything have to happen to me?	5.517041527865873
7604.    grosse	quietly got a broom and started to sweep up the sugar.	5.739974350684024
7605. his mouth worked over the profanity the obscenities in his vocabulary.	4.327444832356384
7606. once he said why'n hell didn't you look in the back	seat of the car before you drove off?	5.837485648625534
7607.  don't you and barney ever	use your brains?	4.913686410369733
7608.    the fat man didn't answer.	7.4941489304896685
7609. he got one	of the menus and brushed the spilled sugar onto it and carried it to	a box on the floor behind the counter.	3.883116145526391
7610. he returned the menu to its	place between catchup bottle and paper napkin dispenser.	6.0677229315649255

7618. you get that kid over to rose's house.	7.684509780742778

7620. why can't i leave her locked up in the tool crib?	7.513933228789628
7621. 	the thin man stopped his pacing long enough to glance at	the clock.	4.0683852436856025

7632. grosse	rubbed the bridge of his nose where it was swollen.	6.4295684997843665
7633. you don't hafta get nasty.	7.159500218971222
7634. i wish you luck when you try	scaring that kid.	6.99100404172838
7635. his voice lost its sullen	tones and he chuckled.	4.876738007440362
7636. what is it?	13.865296900610126
7637. 	impatiently.	10.144513917544229
7638. are you a poor dumb canadian or a smart	aleck from the states?	6.428756832309099
7639.    vince lifted his hand as if to	strike but his thin lips spread in a smile.	3.8101576301595865

7641.    in a chicago	slum just like you.	6.344041092622143
7642. and i ain't going back there on account of	one lousy kid.	6.626860301990295
7643. lauren landis rubbed her face against the blanket.	4.6724501027054846
7644. she had cried a little because she was frightened.	7.372433350752284
7645. she could	easily understand why the two men had been startled to find a strange	girl in the back seat of their car but	she couldn't understand their subsequent actions.	4.029533958292616
7646. was it because	she had shown panic?	8.78332935228386
7647.  who could blame her for that?	6.22647060909004
7648.  it was one thing	to awaken outside a restaurant where your parents were eating and	quite another to awaken in a strange garage and know your parents had	gone on home without you.	4.758702640103122
7649. she was glad the fat man had left.	6.057290893536925
7650. barney	was not really frightening.	8.457718703298294
7651. she jumped as the little man now appeared	at the window and reaching through the opening offered her a	bottle of coke.	3.747842763140264
7652. she smiled at him wetly.	8.764473609234177
7653. although she found she was	thirsty she was about to refuse	when she saw the bottle was unopened.	4.430448116455775
7654. he placed a bottle opener	on the counter.	7.042834174643505
7655. so he understood her panic.	7.4934239689386715
7656. she blew her nose	on a tissue and opened the coke bottle.	6.197871288603115
7657. it was icy cold and tasted	delicious.	6.050103971507023
7658. she felt a lift in spirit.	8.034355361246314
7659. when she was finished she pushed	it back.	6.758270430331227
7660. the man was busy doing something to the inside of the door-frame	on the driver's side of a car.	5.985681333232956
7661. he looked in her direction but he didn't answer.	4.644931773882162
7662. she said barney why is he keeping me here?	7.342972121809288
7663. 	still no answer.	6.939425769494729
7664. he seemed to be looking at a point above the little	window.	7.742255904110648
7665. lauren said why can't i call my home?	4.6724501027054846
7666.  or	borrow some money from someone and go home by bus?	5.9245075971793435
7667.  i could send the	money right back.	6.3737197162782655
7668. barney finished the cigarette he had been	smoking.	6.743273855772659
7669. he dropped it and carefully ground it to nothing with the	sole of his heavy shoe.	3.938707074084564
7670. now he looked at her.	9.772399570813711
7671. he said i only work	here.	7.933564933769555
7672. lauren said please?	9.52328749892442
7673.  but he was back at	work on a car.	6.270804529970305
7674. she dropped her head on her arms on the counter.	6.432292157928805
7675. how could he be kind one moment and cruel the next?	5.037988491544234
7676.  did he know	something that made him feel sad and sorry for her?	6.220571329952982
7677.  and was he afraid	to do anything as definite as releasing her?	4.41390467514399
7678.  her heart was thumping	painfully; the unknown was so much worse than- what dangers lay	ahead for her?	5.655754002905587
7679.  what awful thing had she to face in the next few	hours?	5.5472135953846164
7680.  something wet and hot was trickling on her wrists.	6.7207604144604
7681. tears?	10.144513917544229
7682. 	with a sturdy act of will she turned her mind away from herself;	as long as she could do nothing constructive about the situation	she was in she would think about something else.	4.526949441105067
7683. her mother and father	for instance.	7.288078475010205
7684. where were they now?	10.55931546888576
7685.  in her mind she followed	the white buick along the road somewhere between here and the niagara	river.	4.289770622023271
7686. her father's attention would be on the road ahead and it	wouldn't deviate an inch until he crossed the bridge at the falls	and took the river road to lasalle and finally turned in at their	own driveway at 387 heather heights.	4.709110037445801
7687. then he would yawn and stretch	and shout all out.	5.388620820274677
7688. this is the end of the line.	11.560511026935577
7689. and	what would her mother be doing right now?	4.6724501027054846
7690.  her mother would be fast	asleep curled up against that wonderful big safe solid shoulder next	to her on the front seat.	5.849520114026315
7691. lauren landis was in trouble and	she was alone.	4.6724501027054846
7692. roberta landis put her hand on her husband's	arm as he slid in the driver's seat beside her.	5.073123290103949
7693. somewhere birds	were sweetly calling were answered.	5.584016895279309
7694. her teeth chattered so that she	made three attempts at speech before she became intelligible.	5.75402258535619
7695. i saw that woman's apron behind the door.	5.831213995373541
7696. there was a wet	spot- she couldn't have been gone long.	7.779367079758178
7697. dave made some	sound meant to convey agreement.	4.913686410369733
7698. he inserted the car key in the lock.	6.672854314451728
7699. she stammered you heard	what he said about police?	5.142927756812074
7700.  why don't we drive around the corner?	7.930303022545094
7701. 	the car door crashed shut.	5.619635421798327
7702. the engine throbbed into life.	6.515150583697505
7703. dave said i got the message.	5.219666477665999
7704. walk.	13.921774766768346
7705. suppose lauren comes	looking for us?	6.478996099517286
7706.  i can sit here in the car while you walk around	the corner.	7.247515812393996
7707. the big car sprang away from the curb like something	alive.	4.984225260022372
7708. he said i'm not going to leave my wife and my car	out here in sight of those-   roberta glanced at him and stopped	trembling.	5.5496925947028934
7709. his jowls were spiked by barbs of graying beard.	4.658011605191661
7710. his small mean eyes	regarded marty steadily unblinkingly.	7.065535338067961
7711. his eyes were threaded by little	filaments of red as if tiny veins had burst and flooded blood into	them.	3.8520978293988137
7712. as he chewed his gum and exuded wheezing breath marty smelt	the reek of bad whiskey.	6.0185895192205265
7713. he had driven	the car that passed them on the road outside admassy's place.	5.394602590692529
7714. this was acey squire proprietor of the juke joint.	7.875574084722064
7715. marty	smiled at squire pleasantly and said there was a cab waiting for	me here.	4.49349470067761
7716. do you know where it might have gone?	8.62790514865355
7717.    squire chewed	his gum his jaw moving in a steady rhythm.	4.317068102383446
7718. he looked straight	at marty.	8.977302753578373
7719. marty scanned the faces of the others	nearest him looked into their staring eyes.	4.306316362794303
7720. did anyone see	my cab?	9.87931168695791
7721.  he asked keeping his voice casual.	6.289868235312747
7722. he avoided	showing any surprise or annoyance when no one answered him.	5.925879823256658
7723. i	have to get back to jarrodsville he went on.	5.032850979631857
7724. i see there are	some cars here.	7.9477985373130196
7725. i wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back	to town?	4.487670219971103
7726.  i'd be happy to pay for the favor of course.	6.997835354649057
7727. the seventeen men stood and stared at him for a moment longer.	4.06294131695399
7728. and	then a startling thing occurred.	7.820843401070242
7729. it was so utterly unexpected that	marty stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open foolishly	after it had happened.	3.822111162182049
7730. there was no word spoken no apparent	signal given.	8.537163610072541
7731. yet the men all moved at the same instant.	6.631889751278273
7732. they piled into the waiting cars motors roared the cars sped off.	5.87819432017988
7733. the station wagon and the old plymouth headed east toward jarrodsville.	3.7801037436862637
7734. the ford and the pickup truck sped west toward sanford's	run.	5.315929595247935
7735. in seconds all four cars were out of sight.	4.713566240345231
7736. marty land stood alone on a red-clay road as storm clouds gathered ominously	in the sky again.	5.138210239895059
7737. from a great distance thunder growled and	broke the silence.	5.735512268849339
7738. land looked back toward the dilapidated house.	7.203923209474544
7739. he thought he saw a pale face at a window.	4.736041307623074
7740. perhaps it was dora	may.	11.0722767813693
7741. perhaps she would be glad that they hadn't hurt him.	5.1061462865543925
7742. there	were other farmhouses nearby.	8.569844132667335
7743. across the road there was one no	more than a hundred yards away.	4.7640801039222405
7744. there was another on this side a little	further down.	7.677193754288689
7745. there were many more between here and jarrodsville.	6.362868044595
7746. telephone poles lined the road.	7.712079578137997
7747. they reared tall and mocking.	6.15823983866172
7748. their	wires stretched out into infinity.	7.712079578137997
7749. not a single strand of wire reached	into the silent houses beside the red-clay road.	4.856336184412945
7750. there was	nothing he could do but walk.	8.85471277403918
7751. and jarrodsville was more than three	miles away down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a quagmire.	3.850343884477974
7752. marty faced east and started walking down the left side	of the road.	5.583228874976599
7753. after he had proceeded a few feet he paused and turned	up the cuffs of his trousers which were already damp and mud-caked.	3.928526744272487
7754. the viscous mud was ankle-deep and in places great puddles spread across	the road and reflected the murky light.	4.653079438027171
7755. as he approached	the first farmhouse thunder sounded behind him again closer now and	louder like a steadily advancing drum corps.	4.027094938252582
7756. there were several people	on the porch of the farmhouse.	7.92300291925956
7757. there was a very old man and a young	woman and a brood of children ranging from toddlers to teen-agers.	4.596303025055452
7758. for just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help.	6.3781361174932645
7759. perhaps	they had a car or truck and would drive him into town.	4.0683852436856025
7760. then he realized	the utter futility of the idea.	7.8519609522220755
7761. they were staring at him in the same	blank and menacing way that the men outside the gate had stared.	4.405781588208548
7762. even	the eyes of the smallest children seemed malicious.	7.419964871500705
7763. on his	side of the road there were two farm hands well back in a field leaning	against a plow.	4.628580576943009
7764. they too stared at him.	9.080686971556185
7765. the drums of	thunder were right behind him now.	4.117429059047046
7766. a foolish thought came into	his head.	7.064901200998796
7767. he remembered a story he had read as a youth.	4.467047448170571
7768. it was probably	one of kipling's tales of the british army.	7.4130675276101305
7769. it concerned an officer	who had been disgraced and drummed out.	4.834770518737059
7770. the steady roll of the drums	had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of	the men he had commanded and each man about-faced and turned his back	as the officer approached.	4.249862828857195
7771. marty wished these poor farm people would	turn their backs.	4.477601198394805
7772. the fencing by the roadside ended.	6.154713990487742
7773. now the	dirt highway was bordered on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch	too broad to leap over unless you were an olympic star.	3.607903268004374
7774. the day's	rain had been added to the stagnant water.	6.327652773928801
7775. he was trapped on the	road when he heard the sound of an approaching car.	4.633018301589768
7776. it was coming toward	him.	10.17094121278568
7777. the car was now in sight.	4.881299088783897
7778. marty's heart skipped a beat when	he recognized it.	6.412214371980113
7779. it was the station wagon that had passed his cab	on the road the station wagon that had been parked at the burch farm.	4.024435457787229
7780. it had headed back toward jarrodsville.	9.412943738581847
7781. that had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road.	4.901411238601363
7782. now acey and his friends were returning to seek him out.	6.315833264212564
7783. the station wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of	him beside a fenced field.	4.145284665164436
7784. then there was another sound.	11.501128680110106
7785. a second	car was coming from the west from the direction of sanford's run.	4.923723047691592
7786. it was the ford that had been outside burch's farm.	8.040421957202918
7787. marty	looked helplessly in both directions.	5.619635421798327
7788. it was a narrow road barely	wide enough for two cars to pass.	6.586960253487438
7789. he could not leave the road because	of the water-filled drainage ditch.	5.112397304190614
7790. when the two cars were equidistant	from him the station wagon started up again and the ford gathered	speed.	5.567918359248773
7791. they bore down on him.	6.15823983866172
7792. there was nothing he could do except	jump into the ditch.	7.616217812169564
7793. he jumped and sank to his knees in muddy	water.	4.645344995261077
7794. as the two cars roared by there was a high-pitched eerie	nerve-shattering sound.	7.548188774262749
7795. marty knew how the union soldiers must	have felt at chancellorsville and antietam and gettysburg when the	ragged gray ranks charged at them screaming the wild banshee howl they	called the rebel yell.	3.2653762695140407
7796. for moments he stood in water shivering	and gasping for breath.	6.380184945172053
7797. he had turned his ankle slightly and it	pained him.	5.399011297880304
7798. the cars with their load of howling men had disappeared	in the distance.	5.078074081494962
7799. there had been two more cars parked at the farm	a plymouth and a pickup truck.	4.7882760111933615
7800. they would be coming for him next bearing	down on him from both directions.	6.555592702035593
7801. and then the station wagon and	the ford would seek him out again.	5.051449391947126
7802. he would be harassed repeatedly	and would escape death by inches time after time all the way to jarrodsville.	7.015327764437897
7803. he still had three miles to go.	5.337889447022016
7804. back east the more affluent	juvenile delinquents who could afford hyped-up autos instead of	switch blades as lethal weapons played this same game and called it	chicken.	5.0582248295553836
7805. he could not go through the fields.	6.795361904222249
7806. that way	was barred on both sides of the road by a high barbed-wire fence.	7.536168736050161
7807. he	had to make for the section of road just ahead that was bordered by the	rail fence the section by the farmhouse.	3.520622668418247
7808. at least he could climb	up on the fence when his tormenters roared by again.	6.186201439464281
7809. the admassy place	could not be far now.	4.280553672808819
7810. he would go in there climb through the window	and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest.	5.166100281895092
7811. there	was even a bare chance that the phone had not been disconnected.	4.817505776428851
7812. he did not dare climb back up to the road.	8.740382109781658
7813. he was deep in water but	at least they could not reach him there.	4.398207797120466
7814. he splashed on mud sucking	at his feet with each step until he reached the end of the drainage	ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm.	5.930265704864526
7815. he climbed	back to the road and he felt utterly exhausted.	4.7919199057153365
7816. he stood panting	for a moment.	8.131809156890613
7817. and then he saw something that he had not seen before	and panic gripped him again.	5.223167191080518
7818. the fence his only refuge when	the metal death came roaring at him was made of rails all right	but the rails were protected by a thick screening of barbed wire that	would rip his flesh if he pressed against it.	4.216868348887132
7819. he lurched on down the	road despairingly because there was no place else to go.	4.481597174024588
7820. he lost	all sense of dignity.	8.132854117812016
7821. you could not stand on dignity when you were	soaked and muddied and your life was at stake.	4.28660198426507
7822. probably people were	watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of this farmhouse	too but he did not bother to look.	5.825944215739704
7823. he broke into a dogtrot breathing	heavily streaming with sweat.	5.0810565151495295
7824. he had to reach admassy's place.	10.47361880693241
7825. it was his only sanctuary.	6.939607428470042
7826. the fences on both sides of the road	bristled with the barbed wire.	6.392573036143591
7827. the fences stretched on endlessly.	4.747750369463677
7828. and then he heard them.	10.37258432310273
7829. and now he saw them.	7.572889748625112
7830. the	plymouth was coming at him from the east the pickup truck from the west.	5.987697070983267
7831. they had timed it better this time.	6.080528909006764
7832. they would reach him at almost	exactly the same instant.	7.315167951955183
7833. if he backed	against the fence one of the cars would brush him as it passed and he	would be cruelly lacerated by the wire.	4.32080410885332
7834. he stumbled to the middle	of the road and simply stood there waiting for them a perfect	target.	5.786549597868746
7835. the cars must have had their gas pedals pushed down to	the floor boards.	3.7512122954533114
7836. they were coming on at reckless speed for such old	vehicles.	6.785503657359259
7837. he held his arms close to his sides	and made himself as small as possible.	4.328424581424313
7838. when the plymouth neared it	veered toward him and seemed about to run him down.	6.131211972651599
7839. he forced himself	to stay frozen there.	5.475289483739853
7840. if he moved he would be in the path of the	other car.	8.83736999246598
7841. he thought the fender of the plymouth brushed his jacket	as it went by.	4.182376115348666
7842. in a fraction of a second the pickup truck hurtled by	on the other side.	6.511527478468125
7843. the weird insane sound of the rebel yell	reverberated again and echoed from the distant hills.	3.6270784057113072
7844. he did not	leave the middle of the road.	9.551792578703788
7845. he did not try to run.	7.548074107932105
7846. he trudged on	his aching eyes focused straight ahead.	6.672854314451728
7847. he was nearing the admassy	house.	6.8185940733068335
7848. he was going to make it he told himself.	9.959229041159789
7849. and then he heard	a car coming from the east and he felt as if he would break down and	weep.	5.060780247445218
7850. oh no not again he said aloud.	7.573472848649923
7851. there was a new sound a sound as piercing as the rebel	yell yet different.	4.796895278969402
7852. it was the sound of a siren.	9.592131147506032
7853. now he saw that	the approaching car was painted white and he began to wave his arms	frantically.	4.5174949888987666
7854. it was the prowl car from the sheriff's office.	7.700056032339858
7855. the car drew up alongside him and stopped.	4.292333766985407
7856. get in	charley estes said brusquely.	8.640502039238182
7857. he staggered into the back seat	and lay back fighting for breath.	4.318068015596563
7858. there was someone in front with	the sheriff.	8.490200706401625
7859. it was pete holmes the cabdriver.	6.050103971507023
7860. pete turned	around and said to marty i guess you think i'm a yellow-bellied	hound.	5.9111852024833285
7861. but there wasn't no use in me staying there.	5.575173084784788
7862. i couldn't	fight a dozen or so of 'em.	6.9995046480612055
7863. if i'd stayed all that i'd have	got was four punctured tires and one busted head.	4.122073694712795
7864. why didn't you	wait at the burch house?	7.930303022545094
7865.  you must've known i'd gone to get	the sheriff.	5.603064169507924
7866. i was lucky they let me go i guess.	7.301150766522492
7867. the sheriff	was occupied with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space.	4.0116531824956665
7868. when it was finally pointed east he said you should never have	come out here alone.	6.6908193116692365
7869. every man in every	one of these houses is a night rider.	4.710824604416555
7870. then he turned the telephone over to rourke and went into the	bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes.	5.395113426960904
7871. rourke was	talking on the phone when he came back.	4.843595285653633
7872. about an hour eh?	12.06905059345046
7873.  are	you positive?	8.893413203452333
7874.  he listened a moment and then said hold it.	6.375016808455901
7875. he turned his head and said alvarez will definitely be in a back	room at the jai alai club on south beach within an hour.	3.7006248858727697
7876. want	to try and meet him there?	7.163184125958424
7877.    shayne looked at his watch.	5.619635421798327
7878. that	wasn't too far from fifth street and should allow him to make	scotty's bar by midnight.	5.3894366714821915
7879. he said with satisfaction that's	fine tim.	6.689809985964497
7880. rourke confirmed the appointment	over the phone and hung up.	6.144814417540349
7881. i don't know what you're getting	into mike he said unhappily.	4.799317353742996
7882. i hope to christ h.	9.087206750139993
7883. shayne said briskly grab another drink if you want it.	4.673228437191521
7884. we've	got one other call to make before i meet alvarez.	5.9245075971793435
7885. where?	10.144513917544229
7886.    it's out in the northeast section.	8.788585820632953
7887. have	you got my car here?	5.619635421798327
7888.    it's parked in front.	8.457718703298294
7889. rourke	hastily slopped whiskey into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes.	4.590857987801568
7890. i'd better keep on driving yours shayne decided	because i'll be going on over to the beach.	5.526278398045979
7891. i can drop you back	here to pick mine up.	5.3688559163570195
7892. he went to a closet to get a light jacket	and took his hat from beside the door.	6.493373733686112
7893. timothy rourke gulped down	the whiskey hastily and joined him asking who are we going to call	on in the northeast section?	3.7501065989498836
7894.    a lady.	10.901804862545303
7895. that is maybe	not too much of a lady.	6.007353546033548
7896. at least i want to find out whether she's	home yet or not.	9.012998289420398
7897. he opened the door and followed rourke out.	4.861904554845803
7898. in rourke's car shayne drove east to biscayne boulevard	and north toward felice perrin's address which had been given to	him by the peralta governess.	5.298419317527108
7899. as he drove he filled in timothy rourke	briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter	to go to the peralta house and on his own surmises.	4.523879300687424
7900. i want	to be in scotty's bar at midnight when marsha makes her phone call	there he ended grimly.	5.317271939457362
7901. i don't know whether that threatening	letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not but	i want to see who takes the call.	4.02566405883512
7902. this deal at las	putas buenas where the two knife-men jumped you said rourke with	interest that sounds like it was set up with malice aforethought	by the luscious mrs peralta doesn't it?	4.718830791465363
7903.    it	does shayne grunted sourly still able to taste her mouth on his	in	the green jungle parking lot.	3.744109221929566
7904. that story of hers about an unsigned	note directing her to be there tonight sounds completely phony.	5.9193337160204385
7905. if	it was designed to put me on the spot it would have to have been written	before peralta ever called me in on the case.	5.0375441981322036
7906. do	you think laura did have the counterfeit bracelet made without her husband's	knowledge?	5.788250982780639
7907.    i haven't the faintest idea.	6.316170410054584
7908. i	think her husband strongly suspects so and that's why he called me	in on the thing in direct defiance of his confederates h and almost	certainly without telling them why he was doing so.	4.432830191042747
7909. isn't this felice's	street?	6.939425769494729
7910.  shayne asked peering ahead at the partially	obscured street sign.	6.144814417540349
7911. rourke could see it better out the right-hand	side and he said yes.	4.4914997183457475
7912. turn to the left i think for that	number you gave me.	7.289295815000086
7913. not more than a block or so.	8.313005369643516
7914. shayne	got in the left-hand lane and cut across the boulevard divider.	5.739974350684024
7915. there	was a small neon-lighted restaurant and cocktail lounge on the southeast	corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet palm-lined	street where most of the houses on both sides were older two-story	mansions now cut up into furnished rooms and housekeeping apartments.	3.543677374915456
7916. shayne drove westward from the boulevard slowly letting rourke	crane his head out the window and watch for street numbers.	4.920292053327142
7917. a single	automobile was parked half-way up the block on the left-hand side.	4.033407084863062
7918. shayne noted idly that it carried miami beach license plates as he	approached and then saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they	passed indicating that it was occupied.	4.921600620770584
7919. he turned to see	the briefly-illumed faces of two men in the parked car just as rourke	said it's the next house mike.	4.029157811733562
7920. instead	of pulling into the curb shayne increased his speed slightly to	the corner where he swung left.	5.426716299923994
7921. he went around the corner and parked	turning off his lights and motor.	4.554073579154811
7922. i told you mike said	rourke in an aggrieved voice.	7.276756684192548
7923. it was back there h.	6.621443529496009
7924. shayne said i know it was tim.	6.743273855772659
7925. his voice was chilling and	cold.	5.949600585200961
7926. did you see the car parked across the street?	7.048092162670494
7927. 	i didn't notice it.	6.162967476035402
7928. i was watching for numbers h.	8.963000564203531
7929. it	has a beach license tim.	6.0046621666680675
7930. two men in the front seat.	10.70392988530918
7931. i got a	quick look at their faces as we went past.	4.484892654201212
7932. unless i'm crazy as hell	they're two of painter's dicks.	6.743151854106234
7933. a couple named harris and geely.	5.831358911502619
7934. those names mean anything to you?	8.56325677338693
7935.    wait a minute	mike.	6.939425769494729
7936. in painter's office this evening h.	7.657756991683835
7937. the pair whom petey is officially commending for	slapping me around and pulling me in.	3.570845587849075
7938. what are they doing	here?	11.53336436751645
7939.    a stake-out i suppose.	6.0574501475319265
7940. maybe with specific orders to see that i don't make contact with her.	6.452846174208512
7941. i may be wrong.	7.523380748168757
7942. i'll slide out and	walk around the block back to the cocktail lounge on biscayne.	6.21165633700623
7943. you drive	on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there.	4.662112653877868
7944. you're	a reporter and you're looking for miss perrin to interview her.	5.739974350684024
7945. make them show their hands.	6.820503102965089
7946. if they are beach cops on a stake-out	they'll admit it to a reporter.	7.588507650758979
7947. they've got no official standing	on this side of the bay.	5.2439938405904165
7948. as soon as you find out if they are geely	and harris come on around to the lounge where i'll be waiting.	6.099225763435073
7949. shayne opened the door on his side and stepped out.	4.380881735789058
7950. timothy	rourke groaned dismally as he slid under the wheel.	6.1753962075700795
7951. the things you	talk me into mike h.	4.2803017440322
7952. how often	do they add up to headlines?	8.777417372140908
7953.  you should complain.	10.530765838858049
7954. he crossed	the street and walked swiftly southward to circle back to the boulevard	and north a block to the open restaurant.	5.715153524676874
7955. he was standing	at the end of the bar enjoying a slug of cognac when rourke came	in six or eight minutes later.	4.464437162287625
7956. the reporter nodded as he moved up beside	him at the bar.	5.229622381967921
7957. shayne told the bartender bourbon and water	and rourke told him it's those two all right.	3.8101576301595865
7958. i made them show me their identification before i could be	persuaded not to call on felice perrin.	5.317271939457362
7959. shayne said happily	i've got it all worked out tim.	4.477601198394805
7960. take your time with your	drink.	9.14659839485089
7961. in exactly three minutes go in that phone	booth behind you and call police headquarters.	4.031714729494489
7962. be excited and don't	identify yourself.	9.832374275141998
7963. just say that a couple of drunks are having a hell	of a fight down the street and they better send a patrol car.	4.189146584332689
7964. then	hang up fast and come walking on down to the perrin address.	6.456381190293295
7965. i'll	be waiting for you there.	5.619635421798327
7966. the bartender brought rourke's	drink and shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar.	4.983240996215937
7967. he said in	a low voice i've got a date with a lady mister.	4.734119870325346
7968. will that	pay for a pint i can take with me.	6.723961440790724
7969. you know how it is he added with	a conspiratorial wink.	5.954428991671266
7970. candy is dandy but liquor is quicker h	and you don't have any candy for sale here anyhow.	5.145714404169872
7971. the bartender winked back at him and palmed the bill.	3.873635296338494
7972. he turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of brandy in	a small paper sack which he slid over the counter to shayne.	5.180236117014514
7973. as the detective slid it into his pocket rourke asked sadly what	in hell are you going to do mike?	4.141207293523114
7974.    make a couple of	punk detectives named geely and harris wish to god they'd stayed	out of my way this afternoon.	5.400164840308388
7975. shayne	strode out blithely and rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink	getting a dime ready to make the telephone call to the police.	3.79565685871408
7976. outside shayne hesitated when he saw that rourke had parked his	coupe directly in front of the bar headed south.	6.4556066184394
7977. he walked over to	the right-hand door opened it and got the reloaded automatic out of	the glove compartment and put it in his hip pocket.	3.8542988302107877
7978. he hoped he wouldn't	be forced to use it in taking care of the beach detectives but	its weight was comforting at his hip.	5.655526014796622
7979. on this side of the bay miami	beach cops had no more legal rights than any ordinary citizen and	shayne's pistol permit was just as good as theirs.	4.647931074629783
7980. he went	swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two beach detectives	in the front seat.	5.66169973091898
7981. he tugged the brim of his hat low as he approached	stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around	to the right-hand side.	3.648229826545431
7982. the big paunchy man named geely	was on that side half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced	companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door.	4.649896530853868
7983. shayne turned the handle and jerked the door open before either	of the men were quite aware of his presence in the night.	3.6669692021925724
7984. geely	grunted and slid partly out and shayne's left arm snaked in around	his neck to help him while he set himself solidly on the roadway	and swung his right fist to the big gum-chewing jaw before geely could	straighten up.	4.489499843213026
7985. shayne stepped back to let him slump to the	ground and then dived over him through the open door into harris who	was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster	somewhat impeded by the steering wheel.	3.1789496827607095
7986. shayne locked his big	hands around harris' thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into	the roadway.	5.19431858796559
7987. he hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt	the body go limp.	4.145156813993377
7988. he dropped him into the street a couple of feet	away from geely's recumbent figure and stared down at both of them	for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side.	4.922225151354602
7989. they were both breathing heavily out cold and shayne didn't	think either of them had recognized him or could describe him.	4.220365323080645
7990. he got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and unscrewed the	top sprinkled the pungent stuff liberally over both men and then tossed	the open bottle in on the front seat.	5.242842661198204
7991. he turned then to	look toward the lighted boulevard and saw rourke's tall emaciated	figure come out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the	street toward the opposite side.	3.8350252386197377
7992. shayne strolled across to intercept	the reporter in front of the two-story house where felice perrin	lived and asked casually get the police okay?	5.377585738628344
7993. 	sure.	10.144513917544229
7994. said they'd have a patrol car here fast.	7.227746432017211
7995. what happened with you?	7.945182230386258
7996.    why the two damned fools	got all excited when they saw the bottle and knocked each other out	cold shayne said good-humoredly.	5.319436669888021
7997. they'll have fun explaining	that to the miami cops.	4.6724501027054846
7998. got no business over here on a stake-out anyway.	6.144814417540349
7999. they went up onto a front porch and into a small hallway	where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling.	3.908625945311396
8000. a row of mailboxes	along the wall had numbers and names on them.	5.695711387575787
8001. shayne found one marked	perrin 2-a.	5.619635421798327
8002. the stairway on the right was dark but	there was a wall-switch at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb	at the top and they went up.	5.18189404709329
8003. there were two front rooms both	dark behind their transoms and there was no sound or light in the entire	house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake.	4.384105508076484
8004. eight nine steps above him roberts had paused.	6.790205988029853
8005. mickey paused	with him waiting no longer impatient trying now to think it out	do a little planning.	3.8505883865931376
8006. he looked down over the banister at the hotel desk	with the telephone and pen set.	5.6382868092108245
8007. if i could call in they	could check the story while we were on our way.	4.752173340602049
8008. i wouldn't have to	tell them i had roberts-   then he heard it like a muffled	thud felt a subtle change in air pressure.	4.955403427476937
8009. he glanced up in time to	see roberts hurtling down on him from above literally flying through	the air his bloody face twisted.	3.571045578576454
8010. mickey tried to flatten against the	banister gripped it with one hand but roberts' full weight struck	him at that moment in the groin.	4.831950984790814
8011. he gasped for air and the impact	tore	his hand from the rail.	4.4836704990946785
8012. he tumbled with roberts helpless and in	agony over and over down the steps.	6.040445612174166
8013. by a wrenching effort	he managed to hunch and draw in to take the final fall on his back and	shoulders rather than his head.	3.988865472458234
8014. he was fuzzy in his mind and for a	moment helpless on the lobby floor but he was conscious and free of	the weight of roberts' body.	5.480979395810635
8015. when his vision cleared he saw the taller	one scrambling upward reaching.	5.246480077765862
8016. mickey was on his knees when roberts	turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand.	5.484119607034814
8017. he felt	his empty pocket and knew that roberts had retrieved the only weapon	at hand.	3.9894859797279003
8018. mickey's eyes fixed on the other's feet which	would first betray the moment and direction of an attack.	5.183232782487736
8019. he rose stiffly	forcing his knees to lock.	5.131969917669621
8020. the knifelike pain in his groin nearly	brought him down again.	5.315964723648707
8021. he made himself back off slowly his eyes	wary on roberts who now had no more to lose than he.	4.114897324858656
8022. the pain dulled	as he moved and he steadied inside.	5.655396849912035
8023. after a moment he extended one	hand the fingers curled.	5.398074991596736
8024. you want	to be that big a fool- i was hoping for this.	6.398027823919671
8025. roberts	brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps.	3.9701983041559052
8026. he	held the razor well out to one side.	6.412214371980113
8027. he was invulnerable to attack	but he could be handled mickey knew if he could be brought to make	the first move.	4.382910225409413
8028. they were eight feet apart when roberts cleared	the last step.	6.879788395729704
8029. mickey waited with slack arms.	5.619635421798327
8030. any time	roberts he said.	10.14082813704689
8031. or would it be easier if i put my hands in	my pockets?	4.636129056927588
8032.    the taunt was lost on roberts.	6.154713990487742
8033. he advanced	slowly directly giving no hint of a feint to either side.	4.191792515969988
8034. he was	just short of arm's reach when he stopped.	6.375016808455901
8035. mickey backed off two steps	forcing him to come on again.	4.317068102383446
8036. there was a fixed grin on roberts'	face made hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood.	6.064433956409692
8037. mickey backed off again and roberts hesitated then came along.	4.317068102383446
8038. they moved in a series of rhythmic fits and starts a macabre dance-	two steps back two steps forward two steps back.	5.619892808626137
8039. mickey felt his shoulders	come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door.	3.8849121559715263
8040. this	was going to be it now any second and what he had to remember was	to keep his eye on the razor no matter what even if roberts should	feint with a kick to the groin the deadly hand was his exclusive concern.	5.142280399881638
8041. the kick came sudden and vicious but short.	4.117429059047046
8042. mickey's	guts twisted with the effort but he kept his eye on the weapon.	6.397812923989673
8043. it	moved in a silver arc toward his throat then veered downward.	4.182602481535312
8044. he hunched	his left shoulder into it and slashed at roberts' forearm with	his own felt the blade slide off his sleeve.	5.069581549709806
8045. before roberts could	move inside to cut upward toward his face he slammed his right fist into	roberts' belly.	4.024548572942232
8046. roberts sagged and slashed at him wildly.	6.743273855772659
8047. ducking	mickey tripped and fell to one side landing heavily on the wood	floor.	4.4009702655910825
8048. then roberts was on him gasping for breath and for a couple	of seconds mickey lost sight of the blade.	5.673256023179084
8049. he felt it rip at the side	of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs.	4.023117779751546
8050. he got a	knee up into roberts' belly used both hands and heaved him clear	then scrambled to his feet.	5.294459118435628
8051. they were in the center of the lobby now.	8.130300328618516
8052. still clutching the razor roberts came up into a crouch shaking	his head.	6.203267343815012
8053. when he charged mickey was ready.	6.838070242019934
8054. he hit roberts with his	left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly then wobbled	in mid-air.	5.112129720199295
8055. with his right fist and nearly all his weight behind	it he smashed at the bloodstained face.	4.1446613530307665
8056. roberts careened backward	his back arched fought for balance and failing stumbled against	the newel post at the foot of the stairs.	5.27488559356765
8057. the sound of his head striking	the solid wood was an ultimate sudden-end sound.	4.183491685041025
8058. he fell on	his side across the lowest step rolled over once then lay still.	5.474600110818012
8059. mickey found himself leaning against the desk with stiff hands	panting for breath.	4.0683852436856025
8060. after a minute he went to roberts looked at one	of his eyes and felt for a pulse.	6.236261922147976
8061. roberts appeared	to be dead; if not yet then soon very soon.	4.182602481535312
8062. suddenly it was	cold in the lobby.	8.160454902638557
8063. it seemed to him that a long time	had passed before he decided what to do.	4.353311845841162
8064. actually it was no more than	eight or ten minutes and the sum of his reasoning came to this:	there's no way to take him in now and keep those other two-	wister and the one who hired the two of them- from finding out about	roberts and lamming out.	4.76255265955211
8065. the local law here would hold me till they	check clear back home and maybe more than that.	3.6383268663691006
8066. by then they could never catch up with the others.	7.838426768846924
8067. there's no other	way; i'll have to do it myself.	5.799412832654132
8068. he looked at where roberts	lay sprawled on the step.	6.37444972608874
8069. mickey was sure now he was dead.	4.913686410369733
8070. one thing he thought nobody knows about it yet.	7.480103574989083
8071. he climbed the stairs went into roberts' room found a suitcase	and	packed as much into it as he could.	3.7125232616762074
8072. he left a few things.	8.126604403357652
8073. it didn't	have to be perfect.	6.702258878046396
8074. walking away on impulse	he might logically leave behind what it was inconvenient to carry.	5.54585964024835
8075. when he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about	the room wiping carefully everything he might have touched.	4.440124728107036
8076. it took	him nearly an hour.	9.197812658856618
8077. he went to the room he had rented and got into	his overcoat.	5.40091384423743
8078. he left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby.	8.137920825529466
8079. he set roberts' suitcase near the front door went outside and	walked back to the garage.	4.713549830942399
8080. he was mildly surprised to find it was snowing.	7.025114488421098
8081. it snowed softly silently an undulating interruption of his vision	against the night sky.	4.35831998047207
8082. he could feel it on his face and in his	hair.	7.094358806191324
8083. he found the key to the jeep got it started and warmed	it up for five minutes.	4.383613888124207
8084. then he backed out and swung around to the front	drive.	7.0478264608877845
8085. he went into the hotel and searched till he found the razor.	5.0681807976332705
8086. he put it in his own pocket for safekeeping.	8.249702779971946
8087. he took the suitcase	out to the jeep and put it in the front seat.	5.014725640190837
8088. then he went back for	roberts.	10.099359666992454
8089. the body was heavier than he had anticipated.	4.679568784888818
8090. he	got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down	to the jeep.	5.138210239895059
8091. he dumped it into the back and made sure it wouldn't	roll out then returned to the porch and closed the front door making	sure it was unlocked.	3.823972121638186
8092. he drove carefully in the direction	of the brief tour they had taken earlier.	5.6326495322996974
8093. it snowed continuously but	quietly evenly.	6.702258878046396
8094. when he reached the dip in the woods he saw that	already the earlier ruts were barely discernible.	6.185927580977786
8095. the jeep fought its	way through the low spot and got onto higher ground.	3.6311862882065773
8096. he drove in low	gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance	to the abandoned mine.	5.0278288622832426
8097. he parked facing it and left the headlights	on but when he started into the tunnel with the suitcase he found	the illumination extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the	passage.	3.529158290015521
8098. he went back and got the flashlight returned to the tunnel	and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier.	6.0632449377363535
8099. he tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around	it.	3.9894859797279003
8100. when the dust settled he went back to the jeep and carefully	worked roberts' body onto his shoulder.	6.364706571244111
8101. it wasn't like carrying	the suitcase.	6.702258878046396
8102. the soft snow was deceitful underfoot.	6.154713990487742
8103. inside the passage he had to work his way over the fallen	timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden.	4.2128602771614005
8104. by the time	he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back	ached under the drag of the dead weight.	5.524848015760748
8105. he stood looking down	for a few seconds then backed up two or three paces from the edge.	4.047922428864825
8106. there was too much weight casually to toss it away.	7.376870413322495
8107. he could feel	himself falling in with it and being unable to get out.	4.47044539758148
8108. it would be	a bad place to die.	8.794027392417117
8109. it was a bad place for roberts to wind up but	roberts had asked for it.	4.478423783360017
8110. it was too late to worry about that.	8.498743524071678
8111. he knelt slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel.	4.631234325945854
8112. it was a relief to get rid of the weight.	7.822449746968883
8113. he was shaking with tension	and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down.	4.367184047910622
8114. then he got on his knees and rolled roberts' body toward the edge.	6.711795038988524
8115. it hung momentarily on the point of dropping off.	5.813504099364301
8116. he gave it a	strong push heard it slide then tumble dryly into the hole.	5.838362664168671
8117. he got	to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit.	4.4657062338050215
8118. the body lay	in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel	floor.	6.139431361369931
8119. there was little chance	anyone would enter this shaft during the winter.	5.053717518743647
8120. the external signs of	his approach to it would be covered by the snow probably by the next	day.	5.419775133830456
8121. it wasn't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact.	4.910288359823099
8122. by spring it would be a skeleton.	11.04600772256206
8123. he made his way back to	the jeep.	6.527237067558295
8124. he had started to back into the turn when he remembered	the razor in his pocket.	6.529092826491655
8125. he climbed down went back into the tunnel and	tossed the razor into the pit.	4.3663011250180475
8126. it landed on roberts' sprawled right	thigh poised precariously then slid off to the ground.	6.009165083081223
8127. he went	back once more to the jeep and started the short drive to the hotel.	4.302819725744777
8128. in the garage he checked the jeep for signs of the use he had	made of it.	5.9052005306007676
8129. there were stains here and there and he cleaned them off	using an oiled rag he found on a nail.	4.174212673138597
8130. he wiped the steering wheel	and all the places he might have touched the jeep.	6.023846481141461
8131. he replaced the	flashlight where it had been stowed got into his own car and backed it	out of the garage.	4.1022654664792375
8132. there were tire marks where it had been but they	were overlapped by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable	except under close scrutiny.	6.421933808040947
8133. liz peabody he thought might spend	some time grieving for her lost lover but he doubted that she would	launch an investigation.	3.542415248362911
8134. he judged her to be a woman of some pride	though not much sense.	6.445752993109907
8135. still she would probably have sense enough not	to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who apparently	had run away.	3.8150814440335705
8136. he put in a call to cunningham from his hotel room.	6.327475145199522
8137. the maid	answered and he decided nancy must be at work.	3.873635296338494
8138. jeb cautioned	him not to be too hopeful and then ignoring his own advice said excitedly	but it does sound good.	5.793991354920068
8139. a woman named lisa who tells nobody	anything about herself.	4.879287247102076
8140. that courtyard picture with the same initials.	8.979848215006333
8141. i'm not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm.	5.329698193977834
8142. i'll call you in a day or so.	7.247830248716036
8143. on the highway he relaxed	and enjoyed the drive over lake pontchartrain and along the coast.	4.59469153609173
8144. gulf springs was ten miles inland- more of a quaint old	coast town than those along the beach made garish by tourist attractions.	4.967566766797806
8145. he checked into a motel and drove downtown.	4.862373123883983
8146. the courthouse	was a white-stucco building minus the customary dome.	5.4678654398730995
8147. instead of the	usual straggling privet hedges and patches of bare dirt in most small-town	squares the building was hemmed in by a semitropical growth of	camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably bright-green	shade of florist's grass.	3.384575969948438
8148. he figured his best bet was a call	on the sheriff.	6.130331029301074
8149. a clerk in the outer office took him in to sheriff	carruthers a big paunchy man with thick white hair and a voice with	a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher	office.	3.3747368444474395
8150. seated in front of the desk hank said i'm	looking for some information with very little to go on sheriff.	5.975037840002745
8151. he explained the background of the case ending with the tenuous	clue which had brought him to gulf springs.	3.84940965734348
8152. the sheriff's	swivel chair tilted back.	6.5155523300336915
8153. so you're looking for a woman who married	a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been poisoned.	4.391438885414846
8154. if there was such a person i'm afraid she got away with	it.	6.767657725720841
8155. pity we don't know more about him.	4.913686410369733
8156. i think the best bet is to	go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the grooms	match with the obituaries a little later.	5.969550299074352
8157. it'll be a tedious job	but if you want to try it the old newspaper files are in the basement	here in the county supervisor's office.	4.129532833167767
8158. maybe the society	editor would remember a good-looking out-of-town bride.	6.870852103961657
8159. mrs calhoun has been society editor here	for twenty-five years.	4.881027605220258
8160. the editor says that marriages may be made in	heaven but weddings are made in mrs calhoun's columns.	4.834926168448199
8161. she's	the one who decides which wedding is to get the lead space in the sunday	paper and all that.	4.34170068161824
8162. once when the editor was	just out of the hospital from a gallstone operation mrs calhoun	and the mother of the bride went out to his house and fought it out	beside his bed.	5.694835906824976
8163. she'd be sure to remember any bride who was vague about	background.	4.4487739869185905
8164. she'd have made a great scientist dedicated to tracking	down heredity and environment.	6.476443419595105
8165. she'd also remember if the groom	died later.	4.913686410369733
8166. i wish you good luck but please don't	dig up too tough a case for me this close to election.	5.292494975816421
8167. if you	find out anything come on back here and we'll get started on it.	4.221361074171727
8168. tracking down mrs calhoun was like trying to catch up with	paul revere between lexington and concord.	5.138210239895059
8169. it turned out that	she also sold real estate cosmetics and hospital insurance.	4.81303817721195
8170. the wearying	trek stretched into the afternoon- from newspaper plant to insurance	office to her house and back to the newspaper where he found	her at five o'clock.	4.754124177770216
8171. she was a large woman with a frizzled gray	poodle cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth while	she hunted and pecked on an old typewriter.	3.758416494825238
8172. it took a couple of minutes	to run through her various	businesses and get down to the one he wanted.	6.904818255925616
8173. last year?	11.087544396779553
8174.  well i do remember one.	9.438154249730244
8175. married a man named vincent black.	5.219666477665999
8176. i remember her because	she didn't want her picture in the paper.	6.22447045149064
8177. first bride like that i've	seen in twenty-five years.	5.425572993430162
8178. what reason did she give?	9.152339195294
8179. 	said she had a breaking-out on her face- some sort	of allergy- and none of her old pictures was good enough.	3.6218272354825674
8180. i didn't	see her till several days later at the wedding and her face looked	like it had never had a	blemish on it.	5.01442883908466
8181. but of course you couldn't	see too well through the veil.	4.611992050962474
8182. was her name lisa carmody?	9.063088259980566
8183. 	now how in hell would i remember that?	4.6724501027054846
8184. 	never mind.	11.155741451300253
8185. i can look it up.	7.601006275125875
8186. do they still live here?	10.330518159422326
8187. 	i think they moved away shortly after they were married.	4.4764730232762755
8188. he	was a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred.	6.373620975576336
8189. i'm sure it'll be in the files.	5.988522357404819
8190. we usually run a social note when	somebody moves away.	6.756748504114153
8191. he stood up and thanked her.	5.7759629680214095
8192. have	they inherited some money or something?	7.163184125958424
8193.  she asked with a	reportorial gleam in her eye.	5.411641672863936
8194. he said vaguely well it is	a little legal matter but nothing like that.	6.304785029669258
8195. he hurried across	to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving.	4.380421490847148
8196. sounds like what you're after he said when hank had	finished.	5.978086217609657
8197. come on let's hurry down before they lock up for the	day.	4.236691250260268
8198. in the basement the sheriff took him to a small dingy	office occupied by a tall thin man informal in rolled-up shirt sleeves.	5.697368924685087
8199. mr ferrell h hirey lindsay chairman of the board	of supervisors.	5.505809687795145
8200. mr ferrell is a private detective hirey.	7.399847747143991
8201. wants	to look up something in the newspaper files so don't lock him	in here.	3.9701983041559052
8202. i'll just leave the	door open.	7.712079578137997
8203. it latches when you close it so stay as long as you like.	5.349187171885494
8204. carruthers crossed the room to a metal door with an open	grillework in the top half.	5.765205145613608
8205. now don't shut this	door.	7.372948439593521
8206. it won't open from inside.	9.197812658856618
8207. before we built the new jail	we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail	got too crowded.	3.9109201649428695
8208. hirey treats himself a lot better than we do prisoners.	5.9245075971793435
8209. they were a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with	the cold air from hirey's air conditioner coming through the grille.	3.896713827278061
8210. he walked past the sheriff into a windowless room with	shelves full of big leather-bound volumes from floor to ceiling all	around the walls.	5.014753808963179
8211. a metal table and four chairs stood in the center.	4.274675675810666
8212. they're all here back to 1865 carruthers told him.	6.235597681893292
8213. it's all right to smoke but make sure your cigarettes are out	before you leave.	4.031492469667152
8214. and of course you know not to take clippings.	7.400660968265349
8215. i'll leave the air conditioner on for you mr ferrell	said hirey.	4.182602481535312
8216. don't forget to turn it off and close the door	good so it'll latch.	5.801132703699394
8217. hank thanked them and promised to	observe the rules.	4.706452923182836
8218. when they had gone he stood for a minute breathing	in the mustiness of old paper and leather which the busily thrumming	air conditioner couldn't quite dispel.	5.212820447052883
8219. in	a tour around the stacks he found that the earliest volumes began on	the left and progressed clockwise around the room.	3.897969383992269
8220. an old weakness for	burrowing in records rose up to tempt him.	6.357975757497256
8221. it was indeed	all here- almost a century.	5.619509663343971
8222. from reconstruction to moon rockets.	9.336757847795589
8223. but	he pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to	the newer ones.	4.612579126736837
8224. last year's volume was at the top a couple	of inches below the ceiling.	7.492296316940752
8225. near it was a metal ladder on casters attached	to the top shelf.	4.927032757426987
8226. he pulled it over climbed up and lifted out	the big volume almost losing his balance from the weight of it.	5.230713484844245
8227. he	staggered over and dropped it on the table.	5.487171344009509
8228. since mrs calhoun	remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring he started	to plod through several months.	6.45025391068667
8229. he tried to turn right to the society	page in each one but interesting stories kept cropping up to distract	him.	3.97035990041072
8230. at last he found it in the paper of april 2.	8.482446106638085
8231. it	told him little more than mrs calhoun had remembered stating that	it had been a small modest wedding compared to some of the others.	4.360337736907354
8232. there was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride	and groom.	7.838497182678641
8233. mr black's life was an open book so to speak from	his birth in jackson mississippi through his basketball-playing	days at lsu and his attainment of a ba degree which	had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager	for peerless business machines.	3.2180906411724433
8234. the one line on the bride	said she was miss lisa carmody from baton rouge.	5.413827491046819
8235. no mention of	new orleans.	7.321015458388959
8236. hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for	mr black.	6.708098545828695
8237. if mrs black was who he thought she was mr black's	peerless selling days might well be over.	4.0435333370838284
8238. now for their	exodus from gulf springs.	8.662428316991726
8239. this time the search took twice as long	cutting down on his extra reading for he had to pick through several	columns of one- and two-line social notes in each issue.	3.8735623539270594
8240. he found	it in the edition of may 15.	6.672854314451728
8241. the item said mr and mrs black	had moved to jackson his home town- so the lovely lisa had been	with him a year ago.	3.502253055601742
8242. next on his program was a call to the jackson	office of peerless business machines to find out if vincent	black was still with them- or more specifically still with us.	5.171174211409523
8243. he glanced at his watch saw it was only seven and decided	to indulge his weakness now.	4.132408324279933
8244. for the next hour he scrambled happily	up and down the ladder sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen	mckinley's assassination the iroquois theater fire in chicago	and the hall-mills trial.	5.382824560051405
8245. in the middle of the stock market	crash he heard a slight noise in the outer office.	4.753647322332381
8246. he turned around	saw nothing and decided it must be a mouse.	8.003939231653302
8247. something else distracted	him yet there was no sound only tomblike silence.	5.190373905337779
8248. then he knew	it was not sound but lack of it.	7.0478264608877845
8249. the air conditioner was no longer	running.	4.999950457247551
8250. he jumped up and turned around to see the metal door	closing.	6.969453107950209
8251. it clanged shut as he sprang toward it.	5.332482823974993
8252. he pressed	his face against the grille.	7.5139871259533155
8253. who's there?	8.12896173865557
8254.    the light	shining through the grille dimly illumined the office beyond- enough	for him to see there was no one there.	5.238044075456503
8255. then he heard the outer door	closing.	6.976989057460391
8256. hey come back he shouted.	7.712079578137997
8257. he thought it must	be some damn janitor or cleaning woman puttering around figuring	that hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock	hen the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind.	3.364111366064792
8258. unless	he was stone-blind the person who'd just left couldn't have missed	seeing hank through the open door of the brightly lighted room.	4.807873378411027
8259. and	even if he'd somehow missed seeing him he wouldn't have gone off	and left the light on and door open in the file room.	3.4350960928305088
8260. whoever	it was had meant to shut him up in here had followed him and waited	till the courthouse and square were deserted.	4.807873378411027
8261. but why?	9.503807391647225
8262.  to search	his room at the motel?	8.460031407691005
8263.  to come back later and kill him after the stores	had closed around the square and everybody had left?	3.8154989719303978
8264.  no they	could	kill him just as easy right now.	7.192209541661148
8265. nobody could hear what was going	on in this underground vault.	4.776847378837008
8266. then he heard it and smelled it-	the steady hissing the dread familiar pungency of gas escaping.	5.802069294822455
8267. it must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the	supervisors' office.	4.6196168123020875
8268. until now lilac gaylor and lila kingsley	had been like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace	and choosing.	5.2211299473471575
8269. except for those minutes in her room he had	lost touch with her as a reality.	4.129332380321418
8270. gaylor's obsession and cunningham's	chimera-chasing reminiscences had mesmerized him into thinking	of lila and lilac separately or together as a legend.	5.03986822751212
8271. they kept drifting	apart and merging again in his mind like some minute form of life	on a microscope slide.	3.9466316517881137
8272. i take a little time to	think it over.	7.495965756489355
8273. it was awkward: very awkward.	6.621443529496009
8274. there would be all	the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over.	7.429027990623816
8275. and angie would hear about it.	5.662844612144823
8276. and angie knew-	time said angie and he smiled very sweet and slow at	mr skyros.	5.578362411982167
8277. not too much time because i'll be needing some	more myself pretty much right away.	4.418454352371237
8278. and i done favors for you big	favor not so long back didn't i and i'm right here to take on	where pretty left off.	5.205295721228251
8279. i don't want no trouble you	don't want no trouble nobody wants trouble mr skyros.	4.2720436633429335
8280. dear heaven no thought mr skyros turning away as another	man came in.	5.627076057589525
8281. he straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand;	the genial smile seemed painted on his face.	3.7125232616762074
8282. angie knew- speak	of dangerous information! angie knew too much entirely already.	5.739974350684024
8283. really	he had mr skyros at bay h   big favor i done	you.	4.182602481535312
8284. acourse there's this deal o' denny's- and jackie's-	kinda hangin' fire ain't it maybe you've been kinda worryin'	over that.	4.985333447698777
8285. and can't say i blame you said angie thoughtfully.	4.767272111599635
8286. this deal with the ace o' spades.	7.721199886135428
8287. anything to do with an ace	o' spades bad luck.	5.232038047970196
8288. ace of spades- a widow that was	what they called a widow these low-class crooks remembered mr skyros	distractedly.	5.057556181613073
8289. all about that angie knew too.	5.997706049499358
8290. when things got	a little out of hand they very rapidly got a lot out of hand- it seemed	to be a general rule.	5.036618814130115
8291. all just by chance and in a way tracing	back to poor frank all of it because naturally- brothers living	together- and angie-   mr skyros did not at all like the	look on angelo's regular-featured almost girlishly good-looking	face-	or indeed anything about angelo.	3.778163865880487
8292. mr skyros was not a man	who thought very much about moral principles; he found money much more	interesting; but all the same he thought now uneasily of the way	in which angelo earned his living- and paid for his own stuff-	and eyed the soft smile and the spaniel-like dark eyes and he felt a	little ill.	4.548130592511001
8293. look my friend he said in my life i	learn how is it the proverb says better an ounce of prevention to a	pound of cure.	3.901871775182081
8294. i stay in business so long because i'm careful.	6.662548872677544
8295. two	weeks a month we talk it over again and maybe if nothing happens	meanwhile to say the cops know this and that then we make a little deal	isn't it?	3.42353598467194
8296.    that's a long while said angie.	7.293717709632367
8297. i tell you you want to leave it that way i don't fool around	with it.	4.463231650338993
8298. i go over to castro and get fixed up there.	6.384433951723228
8299. i can't wait	no two weeks.	6.316170410054584
8300. and mr skyros didn't like angie but	what with prettyman and three of his boys inside and not likely	to come out- and angie such a valuable salesman prettyman said-	all the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a	whole new bunch of boys- why did everything have to happen at once?	4.284541975775179
8301. 	denny said stupidly why you ain't turning angie down	are you mr skyros?	4.0683852436856025
8302.  i mean we all figured- i guess anybody'd	figure- angie-   angelo gave him an affectionate	smile.	5.786946770530938
8303. mr skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me	he said.	4.580790424328508
8304. it's ok denny everything's ok ain't	it mr skyros?	6.412214371980113
8305.    oh god the name repeated over	and over anybody to hear- not being a fool mr skyros knew	why.	3.916427311546195
8306. but aside from everything else it would scarcely be pleasant	to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually	held- you could say- the whip hand.	4.707012734801761
8307. and all because of domokous!	if mr skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would	eventually cause-   of course there was another factor.	3.9938960819831557
8308. angie	worth his weight in gold right now but these users they sometimes	went down fast.	5.331440467598945
8309. who knew angie might not last long h.	5.414630407466735
8310. the sweat broke out on mr skyros' forehead as he realized he had	been actually thinking- hoping- planning- perhaps-   good	god above had not domokous been enough?	4.398528065430878
8311.    he patted angelo's	thin shoulder paternally.	5.926245264679889
8312. now you don't want to go talking	that way he said.	7.068496006138226
8313. sure sure you're the one take over	for pretty soon as i get the supply get started up again isn't	it?	3.771265239626905
8314.  you don't need worry angelo.	9.82530560865697
8315. i tell you i know how it is	with you my friend i sympathize and i'll make it a special point-	a special favor- get in touch and get some stuff just for you.	3.4785730198330267
8316. i don't know if i can manage it tonight or tomorrow but i'll try	my best my friend.	5.563444410969871
8317. you see you got to remember we all got schedules	like any business! my man he won't be around a little while	he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the elite.	3.683916805542714
8318. it's	awkward you see that isn't it?	7.574018374029068
8319.    well that's	your business mr skyros said angie and his dreamy eyes	moved past mr skyros' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground-glass	window.	3.7676214881415353
8320. i appreciate it you do that.	8.077395033297607
8321. we don't none	of us want no trouble h.	5.178564667584603
8322. i'm in a room over the golden club on	san pedro you just ask for me there you want see me.	4.955660642149097
8323. or maybe i	call you- tonight?	6.70809771654442
8324.  about nine o'clock i call and see if you	got any.	6.692554306367813
8325. a couple decks for me mr skyros- and ten-twelve to sell	see i like to have a little ready cash.	4.472258754268794
8326. oh now	i don't know about that much said mr skyros.	6.699717300690735
8327. and you know	angelo pretty he always keeps it a strict cash basis like they	say-   sure said angie.	3.999973797282049
8328. fifty a throw that the deal?	7.163184125958424
8329.  sure.	10.144513917544229
8330. i bring you the cash say five	hundred for ten decks.	6.38667026629645
8331. never mind how much i cut it how much i	get and he smiled his sleepy smile again.	3.943003606582089
8332. you go 'n' have a look round for it.	7.768517097425494
8333. i	do my best said mr skyros earnestly just for you my friend.	4.208376751397433
8334. this is awkward for everybody isn't it we all got to put up with	inconvenience sometimes.	6.0173354175314415
8335. but i do my best for you.	6.81781351420173
8336. he got out	of there in a hurry brushing past another man in the door mopping	his brow.	6.053937700914629
8337. the expedient thing- yes very true one must make	do as one could in some situations.	3.608291483351062
8338. it could all be straightened out	later.	9.411609560915464
8339. not very much later but when things had settled down a little.	4.549362017290251
8340. after this deal with the bouvardier woman went through.	8.070013073587473
8341. an ace	of spades h.	7.030371004494014
8342. he was not a superstitious man but he felt perhaps	there was a little something in that indeed.	6.571438787791221
8343. he rather wished he	had never got into the business and still- scarcely to be resisted	a nice little profit with not much work involved easy money h	katya roslev who would be katharine ross so very soon now	rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change.	3.272497064775979
8344. she	did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without	a smile or a word of thanks.	5.319444640002473
8345. usually she marked the few who did	thank you you didn't get that kind much in a place like this: and	she played a little game with herself seeing how downright rude she	could act to the others before they'd take offense threaten to call	the manager.	3.257074025004034
8346. funny how seldom they did: used to it probably.	6.144814417540349
8347. the	kind who came into a cheap store like this! grab snatch i saw	that first! and here i'll take this i was before her	you wait on me now or i don't bother with it see! this kind of	place h   she'd be through here just no time at all- leave	this kind of thing 'way behind.	3.067944217027208
8348. off at noon and she'd never come	back.	7.418279066239047
8349. money- a lot of money enough.	7.140027169278105
8350. she'd	be smart about it get him to give it to her in little bills so's	nobody would suspect- maybe couldn't get it until monday account	of that the banks- but that wasn't really long to wait.	4.634074697979076
8351. not when	she'd waited so long already.	6.242671185362519
8352. no need say anything at all	to the old woman.	7.214045957098085
8353. she had it all planned out how she'd do.	5.367562631078335
8354. she'd	say she didn't feel good on sunday couldn't go to church- there'd	be a little argument but she could be stubborn- and when the	old woman had gone quick pack the things she'd need to take all	but the dress she'd wear monday and take the bag down to that place	in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight for	a dime.	4.234497090748168
8355. then on monday morning- or it might have to be tuesday-	get up and leave just the usual time and last thing put the money	in an envelope under the old woman's purse there in the drawer.	3.6363209840314514
8356. she	wouldn't be going to get that for an hour or so after katya had left	go do the daily shopping.	5.3869981995744425
8357. no need leave a note with it either-	or maybe just something like don't worry about me i'm going away	to make a better life.	3.6826744813302152
8358. it wasn't	as if she wanted much.	8.39397876591202
8359. she didn't mind working hard not as if	she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft- all she	wanted was a chance where she wasn't marked as what she was.	3.4448990353602578
8360. to	be katharine ross and work in a nicer shop somewhere at a little	more money so she could have prettier clothes and learn ladies' manners	and all like that and get to know different people than up to now	not just the ones like her here with foreign-sounding names the	ones went to the same church and- different place different job different	people she'd be all different too.	4.470020715585017
8361. prettier she'd do her	hair another way; smarter and wear different kinds of clothes-	she'd be katharine ross just what that sounded like.	3.5786583149140854
8362. you've give me the wrong change said the customer sharply.	5.9245075971793435
8363. think	i can't count?	6.939425769494729
8364.    katya made up the amount in indifferent	silence.	6.743273855772659
8365. she was listening to other voices out of the future.	6.117138111669114
8366. some of those vaguely-imagined new different people.	8.674261615737912
8367. oh katharine's	awfully nice and pretty too i like katharine- let's	ask katharine to go with us she's always lots of fun- katharine-	soon very soon now h	mendoza	didn't	wake until nearly nine-thirty.	3.571083604285698
8368. it was going to be another hot	day; already the thermometer stood close to ninety.	7.043369551583319
8369. alison was still	sound asleep; he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk	drawers for more cigarettes before thinking of her handbag and found	a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom which tasted peculiarly	of face powder.	3.230817368022455
8370. he left a note propped on the desk asking her to call	him sometime today and drove home.	5.172320272641659
8371. after he'd got out fresh	liver for bast he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her	dish.	4.435887217406911
8372. surely she was just a trifle fatter around the middle?	6.420451165716851
8373.  he	seemed to remember reading somewhere that abyssinians had large litters	and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a	dozen kittens.	3.5951463555789704
8374. y que sigue despues?	8.457718703298294
8375. - what then?	6.939425769494729
8376.  he	asked her severely.	9.52328749892442
8377. a lot of people are so peculiar that they don't	like cats it's not the easiest thing in the world to find good	homes for kittens- and damn it you know very well if i have them	around long impossible to give them away! and i suppose now that	you've finally grown up if a little late you'd go on producing	kittens every six months or so.	3.3386440037193417
8378. yes well it's a pity to spoil your	girlish figure- which all those kittens would do anyway- but i	think when you've raised these we'll just have the vet fix it so	there won't be any more h.	4.71515126377623
8379. i wonder if the carters would take one	h.	5.3101261813867815
8380. and it's no good looking at me like that as she wound affectionately	around his ankles.	5.45800105565028
8381. maude's long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up.	5.219666477665999
8382. happened to be in the	hall! happened to hear you quarrel about her! oh well you can't	really blame lolotte.	5.665968011296827
8383. she lost her beau to you.	5.856547304788402
8384. but	she was talking of emile when she saw the black line of the open door;	sarah remembered it clearly.	5.23663917276063
8385. i've got to	get busy.	6.162967476035402
8386. miss celie's taken to her bed with the door locked.	6.5644987246265005
8387. she	opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you.	4.008689860533503
8388. here-	she thrust a bundle of keys strung on a thick red cord into sarah's	hand.	5.440325501586134
8389. not that there's much use in locking up the smokehouse	and the storehouse now.	4.649808428118332
8390. maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring	it down her throat.	5.9245075971793435
8391. i don't want it sarah said firmly.	5.570043890591218
8392. well- i'll take it down with me as i go.	5.9245075971793435
8393. maude swooped up the cup and hiked up her top hoop as if about to take	off with a racing start.	3.563299861712242
8394. at the door she turned back her roman nose	looking very long now and satiric.	6.454103759065612
8395. ben and lucien	have gone after them.	5.219666477665999
8396. it's just like that book your northern friend	wrote- except there aren't any ice floes to cross and no bloodhounds.	4.920292053327142
8397. i don't know mrs stowe h.	6.0798109377668945
8398. what can they	do if they find them?	8.351680165337362
8399.    they can't do anything.	6.831355567407999
8400. it's	silly childish running after them like that.	6.743273855772659
8401. but	of course the paterollers won't be of any help not with everything	so upset and that yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around	god knows where.	3.377283645704905
8402. she had swished away she had been gone for	a long time probably when sarah suddenly realized that she ought to	stop her pour out the coffee so no one would drink it.	4.996577606856635
8403. but then the	so-called coffee was bad enough at best cold it was all but undrinkable-	especially that cup!   she was deeply horribly sure	that lucien had filled it with opium.	3.6339449829710437
8404. she had quarreled with lucien	she had resisted his demands for money- and if she died by the provisions	of her marriage contract lucien would inherit legally not	only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboards in the office but	later when the war was over her father's entire estate.	4.628184227267626
8405. she	felt cold and hot sticky and chilly at the same time.	5.009424816070788
8406. now wait a	minute she told herself think about it; lucien is not the only person	in this house who could have put opium in that coffee.	5.499587882064733
8407. she	had lost a bottle of opium- but that was on the trip from new orleans.	4.484094379484606
8408. or someone had taken it during her first day at honotassa.	6.580965681718964
8409. yes	she had missed it after her talk with emile after dinner just	before emile was shot.	3.8101576301595865
8410. rilly or glendora had entered her room while	she slept bringing back her washed clothes.	5.331440467598945
8411. so somebody else could	have come in too- then or later while she was out of the room.	4.926409845603704
8412. it	would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor.	5.764724186827919
8413. it was	not very reasonable to believe that lucien had procured unprocurable	opium and come back to honotassa with a formed plan to murder her.	3.9308902902122034
8414. he	didn't even know that she was there.	7.960290846024456
8415. and he certainly couldn't	have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she	was not the yielding- yes and credible fool he had every right to	expect.	3.662335093688209
8416. no he had been surprised unpleasantly surprised but surprised.	8.121014110070625
8417. then somebody else?	8.198431326156106
8418.  don't question rev had said don't	invite danger.	6.743273855772659
8419. her skin crawled: lolotte had told maude that	she was in the hall and the door was open.	4.384928904072917
8420. sarah had begun to tell	lucien of emile she had begun to question and a little draft had crept	across the room from the bedroom door open barely enough to show	a rim of blackness in the hall.	4.555038284666545
8421. so lolotte- or anybody- could have	listened and that somebody could have already been supplied with	the missing bottle of opium.	3.9874687688779056
8422. that was not reasonable either.	11.67663471543638
8423. the opium had disappeared before emile's death and whoever shot him	could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen sarah's	own doubts and suspicions- and questions.	3.385707588419866
8424. she began to doubt	whether there had been in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup.	6.658477385726625
8425. so	suppose somebody only wished to frighten her so she would leave honotassa!	that made a certain amount of logic.	3.632711015013689
8426. added to the	argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it	had been still hot she might even have drunk some of it she wouldn't	have taken enough to kill her for she would have been warned by	its taste.	4.852217254219192
8427. it was merely an attempt to frighten her.	5.59692687946112
8428. she wouldn't go back to new york as maude suggested; she wouldn't	run like a scared cat.	6.443922565877434
8429. but- well she'd be very careful.	5.219666477665999
8430. she dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense	of normal everyday life.	5.6835767868554585
8431. but before she left her room she dug	into her big moire bag took out the envelope holding her marriage contract	and the wax seal had been broken.	3.479636289781363
8432. so somebody else knew what	would happen to her father's money if she died.	5.94137764994356
8433. rev had known	all along.	6.162967476035402
8434. rev didn't need to break the wax seal read the contract	and find out.	5.448482501884564
8435. he could conceivably have wished to make sure; rev	loved honotassa it was like a part of his breath and body; rev	had stressed the need for money.	4.622166291943673
8436. rev would never have tried to give her	poison!   she thrust the envelope back in the bag; there	was no point in locking it up in the armoire now it was like locking	the barn after the horse was stolen.	5.128749565832367
8437. and in all likelihood by now	there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her	marriage contract.	5.420618104589415
8438. there was no point either in telling herself again	what a fool she'd been.	6.5988419862828245
8439. she went downstairs and received another	curious shock for when glendora flapped into the dining room in	her homemade moccasins sarah asked her when she had brought coffee	to her room and glendora said she hadn't.	3.474816324797391
8440. too much work this morning	miss sarah- everybody gone like that-   sarah swallowed	past another kind of constriction in her throat.	5.477003980313788
8441. well then	who brought it?	7.7351704919394075
8442.    miss maude.	14.172511716398928
8443. she come to the kitchen	and say she take it up to you.	4.847772681423493
8444. glendora put down a dish of lukewarm	rice.	6.743273855772659
8445. not much breakfast this morning.	6.853860887161802
8446. i don't know what we're	going to do miss sarah.	6.887110893493336
8447. we've got to eat	sarah said curtly because a chill crawled over her again.	3.9701983041559052
8448. the rice wasn't dosed with opium	indeed it had no taste at all not a grain of salt.	4.819019101947726
8449. she ate what she	could and went out along the covered passageway with the rain dripping	from the vines.	3.8930174979719525
8450. in the kitchen glendora was despairingly picking	chickens.	8.405075976657411
8451. get a basket sarah told her.	5.757217458810273
8452. we'll go to the	storehouse.	8.457718703298294
8453. glendora dropped a chicken and a flurry of feathers	and went with her through the drizzle to the storehouse.	3.632711015013689
8454. sarah	found the right key and unlocked the door.	6.412214371980113
8455. it was a long	low room like a root cellar for it was banked up with soil and vines	had run rampant over that too.	3.9290077971957085
8456. it was dark but dry and cool.	7.711906994129459
8457. she	doled out what glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried	peas eggs cornmeal a little salt.	3.685338251241182
8458. the shelves looked emptier than	when miss celie had shown her the storeroom and since the men from	the commissary had called; there were certainly now fewer mouths	to feed but there was less to feed them with.	4.553179330059627
8459. she took glendora to	the smokehouse unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still	a quantity of hams and sides of bacon hanging from the smoke-stained	rafters.	3.60902552318324
8460. they wouldn't go hungry not yet.	7.7782111142395784
8461. and the fields	were green and growing.	6.467139634581779
8462. can't you possibly imagine what life is	going to be like here?	5.875260425571708
8463.  maude had said.	6.939425769494729
8464. she	sent glendora back to the house her basket and her apron laden.	6.908580996359359
8465. she	stood for a moment rain dripping from the trees over her head thinking	of maude.	4.22157421283325
8466. maude had the opportunity to take the bottle	of opium from sarah's room.	6.963717959851666
8467. maude had the cool ruthlessness to d	o	whatever she made up her mind to do.	3.8849121559715263
8468. she couldn't see how her death	could affect maude.	7.057872112361533
8469. she couldn't see any reason why maude would	attempt to frighten her.	4.516262660452241
8470. besides there was something hysterical and	silly something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her.	5.831669530947041
8471. maude	was neither hysterical nor silly and sarah rather doubted if she	had ever	been childish.	3.9701983041559052
8472. yet maude had suggested that sarah return to	new york.	6.833066908677638
8473. maude could have shot emile- if she'd had a reason	to kill him.	4.0683852436856025
8474. there was no use in standing there in the drizzle	trying to find a link between emile's murder and opium in a cup	of coffee.	5.990499884590066
8475. she started back for the house saw a light in the	office opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was	far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder.	3.355780294230757
8476. rev george	and lolotte were mending shoes.	7.163184125958424
8477. a lighted lamp stood on the	table that dusky drizzling day.	4.274675675810666
8478. they were all three bent over a shabby	riding boot; george had a tack hammer.	5.924030977580307
8479. lolotte held a patch of	leather rev steadied something a tiny brad waiting for george's	poised hammer.	3.8101576301595865
8480. george said first thing i do when i get to vicksburg	again is get me a yankee-   with boots on	lolotte laughed softly.	5.160440675205735
8481. rev looked up and saw her.	5.422585789221504
8482. lolotte	looked up and stiffened.	8.457718703298294
8483. george didn't look up at all.	5.911685571936007
8484. there was	no way to know no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised	at sarah's appearance believing her to be drugged and senseless-	and just possibly dead.	5.582208508966618
8485. rev said come in sarah.	5.619635421798327
8486. reckon	you know the news.	8.457718703298294
8487. and what news sarah thought as satirically	as maude might have said it.	4.694608655019314
8488. rev's face was suddenly	a little fixed and questioning.	6.412214371980113
8489. he turned to george and lolotte.	6.247184443311795
8490. take	your cobbler's shop somewhere else.	7.712079578137997
8491. i want to talk to sarah.	8.444758910518466
8492. everything in the office the spreading circle of lamplight	the patch of leather in lolotte's hands.	6.3137974782103745
8493. george poised with the	tack hammer the homely everyday atmosphere all denied an attempt	at murder.	4.163123547003543
8494. a rush of panic caught sarah.	7.064901200998796
8495. i mean	i've got to- to see to the kitchen.	5.007407311919444
8496. glendora-   her words	jumbled together and she all but ran from the office and from the	question in rev's face.	4.985333447698777
8497. now why did i do that?	6.658996561512765
8498.  she thought	as warm drizzling rain touched her face.	7.057872112361533
8499. she was no schoolgirl	refusing to bear tales.	5.993022935739079
8500. as she reached the kitchen door the answer	presented itself; if she told anyone of the opium it must be lucien	her husband.	5.773186701226092
8501. it might be indeed it had already proved	to be a marriage without love but it was marriage.	4.723843519178358
8502. so she couldn't	choose rev as a confidant; it must be lucien.	7.442263379478413
8503. always provided	that lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium she thought	as coldly and sharply again as maude might have said it.	3.454135651060145
8504. she paused at the kitchen door caught her breath told herself firmly	that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into	the kitchen where glendora was eyeing the chickens dismally and maude	was cleaning lamp chimneys.	4.51680535264328
8505. miss sarah	i can't cut up no chicken.	5.598949562702771
8506. miss maude say she won't.	9.046288316196136
8507. again the homely everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious	attempt to frighten her- or to murder her.	4.022904155970181
8508. the homely everyday	details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her	with their immediate urgency.	4.949144601599721
8509. no matter what had happened or hadn't	happened	somebody had to see about dinner.	5.464404620666588
8510. she eyed the chickens with if she	had known it something of glendora's dismal look and thought with	a certain fury of the time she had spent on latin verbs.	5.197775089511103
8511. i didn't think there was any reason	to.	5.406629921006237
8512. speak to him again anyway.	7.712079578137997
8513. try	talking to some of the fellows he works with friends anyone.	5.028476395031617
8514. try	to find out how happy he is with his wife whether he plays around with	women.	5.956528884394914
8515. you might try looking into his wife too.	6.0576855140728965
8516. she might have been	talking to some of her friends about her husband if they've been	having any trouble.	5.515683361664855
8517. you think black's the one we're	looking for?	5.987368004347948
8518.    yeah.	13.921774766768346
8519. i think he might be conrad	said grimly.	7.0990156588299
8520. then again he might not.	9.106390224296938
8521. what a stinking	world rourke said.	7.451094405775481
8522. black is gilborn's best friend.	7.839278414951784
8523. will you be coming back soon?	6.62137743304706
8524. 	i think so.	9.52328749892442
8525. i'm on my way to see the jacobs woman.	6.045594321391491
8526. gilborn's secretary?	11.155741451300253
8527.  what for?	10.509353167850248
8528.  you don't think gilborn	is the-?	9.82530560865697
8529.    i don't think anything.	7.307651568093202
8530. i just don't	want to go off half-cocked before picking up black that's all.	6.203294215089196
8531. gilborn says he was in his office all day with	her yesterday.	5.038501470925826
8532. i'd like to make sure.	8.24427397741127
8533. also it's just possible	she might know something about mrs gilborn.	4.742951016467639
8534. aren't you ever going to go home?	6.9929243114621435
8535. 	it sure as hell doesn't look like it does it?	4.317068102383446
8536. 	i'm telling you if these corpses ever knew the trouble they put us	to they'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off.	4.758972536424235
8537. remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet.	5.184996204244576
8538. conrad hung up and sat on the small telephone-booth bench massaging	his right leg.	5.596607634654504
8539. he looked at his watch.	5.925483822924937
8540. it was ten minutes	before eleven.	9.417798267063285
8541. he wondered how long it would be before they	had a signed confession from lionel black.	4.434729892200626
8542. thirty years' experience	let him know even at this early stage that black was his	man.	5.4273428335501395
8543. but he still wanted to know why.	6.329873775942868
8544. it was a cold windy	day the day after kitti's death but stanley gilborn paid no	attention to the blustery october wind.	5.536064804017276
8545. after leaving conrad	gilborn had no destination.	6.076902799778918
8546. he simply walked not noticing where	he was not caring.	6.375016808455901
8547. he stopped automatically at the street corners	waiting for the traffic lights to change unheeding of other people his	coat open and flapping.	3.5708803927356207
8548. as he walked he tried to think.	9.530261384225199
8549. mainly of what conrad had tried to make	him believe.	4.999592853804176
8550. there was nothing coherent about his thinking.	8.830063978174358
8551. it was a succession of picture-images passing through his mind: the	same ones different ones in no apparent sequence in no logical succession.	3.9025519204784107
8552. the enormity of what conrad had told him made it impossible	for gilborn to accept with any degree of realism the actuality	of it.	4.489187264353258
8553. conrad's words had intellectual meaning for him only.	4.6724501027054846
8554. emotionally they penetrated him not at all.	6.743273855772659
8555. whoever he	was and your wife were intimate.	5.160578364601868
8556. gilborn remembered conrad's	exact words.	8.457718703298294
8557. they made sense and yet they didn't.	5.80976489332276
8558. he knew conrad	had told him the truth.	7.8220423312603495
8559. yet it wasn't so.	8.400009343371906
8560. it wasn't	so because it couldn't be so.	7.788832957144139
8561. when kitti was alive-	and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his arm-	she had been the center of his life.	4.553543971013214
8562. she was the sun he the	closest planet orbiting around her the rest of the world existing	and visible yet removed.	6.934717259144407
8563. for fifty-five years he had lived progressing	towards a no-goal eating working breathing without plan	without reason.	4.236830274359316
8564. kitti had come along to justify everything.	6.743273855772659
8565. she	was his goal she was his reason.	4.942600426351753
8566. he had lived all his life waiting	for her.	7.90562073570251
8567. not once in the time that he had known her had he	ever considered the possibility not once not for one one-thousandth	of a second of her infidelity.	4.011591896189288
8568. he could not consider it now.	9.680233688416797
8569. and so he walked aimless again.	6.929303711879526
8570. the walk ended	inevitably right in front of his hotel building.	6.444099550801093
8571. the doorman began	to nod his head automatically then remembered who gilborn was what	had happened to him the night before.	3.3564185518874785
8572. he looked at gilborn with undisguised	curiosity.	7.513118219918902
8573. gilborn passed by him without seeing him.	4.913686410369733
8574. he crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own	thoughts.	6.30217110928003
8575. in the apartment itself all was still.	5.610079648512412
8576. the police	were no longer there.	6.5155523300336915
8577. there was no evidence that anything was different	than it had been.	5.381313756498098
8578. except that kitti wasn't there.	8.815547968435892
8579. without taking off his coat he sat in the blue chair which still	faced the closed bedroom door.	4.431041180217449
8580. at last sitting there in the	familiar surroundings the truth began to sink in.	6.342890327818011
8581. who?	10.144513917544229
8582. 	he felt no anger towards kitti no sense that she had betrayed	him.	6.089820700336717
8583. who?	10.144513917544229
8584.    she was all he had everything he had	everything he wanted.	6.931887347828596
8585. someone had taken her away from him.	4.9836024417860925
8586. who?	13.921774766768346
8587.    where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger there	is a right-hand one he remembered from his school days.	4.404084032704803
8588. where	there is a victim there is a killer.	7.879721214677003
8589. who?	10.144513917544229
8590. 	whoever he was and your wife were intimate.	6.6749664491077745
8591. he rose from	the	chair took off his coat.	5.131969917669621
8592. quickly he went into the bedroom.	8.529267708170996
8593. the bed still showed signs of where kitti had lain.	4.008208851696864
8594. gilborn stood	there for a long time.	8.69641778938339
8595. he looked at the bed unblinkingly.	5.800139922469571
8596. the	bed was empty now.	8.457718703298294
8597. kitti would lie in it no more.	5.128567532794929
8598. he would lie in	it no more.	8.575165576496346
8599. gilborn wondered whether kitti had lain in that	same bed with h who?	4.0683852436856025
8600.    for thirty minutes stanley gilborn	stood there.	7.946200604844278
8601. at the end of the half-hour racking his brains	thinking over and over again of kitti her friends her past he	left the bedroom.	4.493273342515453
8602. who?	13.921774766768346
8603.    he could think of no answer.	6.38643307611456
8604. gilborn put on his coat again.	7.163184125958424
8605. before leaving he took one	last lingering look at the apartment.	5.719497849049075
8606. he knew he would never	see it again.	8.29222135107965
8607. in the street walking as quickly as he could stanley	gilborn was a lone figure.	4.3161347845480975
8608. on blanche jacobs kitti	gilborn's death had a quite different effect.	6.904527838085082
8609. for blanche kitti's	death was a source of guilty but nonetheless soaring happy hope.	4.663202003909028
8610. in blanche's defense it must be said she was unaware of	the newborn hope.	6.854545990911375
8611. if anyone had asked her she would have described	herself only as nervous and worried.	4.4353881500591354
8612. the figures on the worksheet	paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it	was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with	the typewriter.	4.794834623510732
8613. she wondered whether stanley would call.	5.856547304788402
8614. she	wanted to be with him to give him the comfort and companionship she	knew he needed.	5.705877728716406
8615. she had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that	he might call while she was out.	4.331851352225142
8616. and now she was feeling	sick both from concern about stanley and hunger.	6.416491850546567
8617. why hadn't	he called?	8.95327531422035
8618.    men she reflected even men like stanley	are unpredictable.	7.012451314114861
8619. she tried to think of his unpredictable	actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they weren't	so many after all.	3.9007642367289326
8620. stanley really was quite predictable.	7.712079578137997
8621. that was one of the things she liked about stanley.	7.349641820843483
8622. he wasn't like	so many other men.	7.5139871259533155
8623. the dentist last night for instance.	4.933690891186491
8624. dinner and	the movies had been fine.	7.163184125958424
8625. he had taken her upstairs to say good night.	5.456299697098671
8626. she had invited him in for coffee.	8.362864854255827
8627. it was in the kitchen	as she was watching the kettle waiting for the water to boil that	he had grabbed for her.	4.406515622554916
8628. without warning without giving her a chance	to prepare for it.	6.56406349808911
8629. from behind he had put his arms on her shoulders	turned her around and pressed her to him so close she couldn't breathe.	3.7507075631714764
8630. later she apologized for the long scratch across his face	tried to explain she couldn't help herself that the panic arose	in her unwanted.	5.188435297721504
8631. when he left she knew	she would never see him again.	5.234299795306578
8632. she	could always predict what stanley was going to do ever since she	first met him.	6.299178298895833
8633. except for that one morning.	6.659924272015826
8634. the morning he walked	in to announce to her blushing that he was married.	5.67311667702174
8635. she thought	she was going to die.	7.181160809935927
8636. she had assumed before then that one	day he would ask her to marry him.	6.210002731693382
8637. blanche couldn't remember	when she had first arrived at this conclusion.	4.493451728436404
8638. she thought it was	sometime during the second week she worked for stanley.	6.670677462758103
8639. it was nothing	that he said or did but it seemed so natural to her that she	should be working for him looking forward to his eventual proposal.	3.583216120406276
8640. she was thirty-one years old then.	8.92730245649156
8641. her mother was already considerably	concerned over her daughter's future.	5.5266672591775885
8642. but blanche had been	able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed	mother's continued carping had been able to resist her urgings	to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of matrimony.	5.150412104986488
8643. for blanche it was only a matter of time before stanley would	propose.	5.707261054092088
8644. it was to be expected that stanley would be shy slow in	taking such a momentous step.	6.833734581592029
8645. stanley went along in life she knew	convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman.	3.771629288689675
8646. as a result	he never looked for it.	8.174968888330797
8647. but one day she expected he would	somehow discover without her having to tell him that there was such	a woman in the world; a woman who was willing to give him love faith	and anything else a woman could give a husband.	3.7120068962164776
8648. indeed there was	a woman who unasked had already given him love.	6.438291193168694
8649. and then unexpectedly stanley made his	announcement.	6.474117065201322
8650. on that first day blanche literally thought	she was going to die or at the very least go out of her mind.	6.305169450699283
8651. it might have been easier for her if kitti walker hadn't been	everything that blanche was not.	4.7441492225385735
8652. kitti was thirty years younger	than stanley taller than stanley prettier than stanley had any	right to hope for much less expect.	4.861416487662795
8653. kitti could have married a score	of men.	4.913686410369733
8654. there was no reason for her to marry someone like stanley	gilborn there was no need for her to marry stanley.	6.211300583661821
8655. kitti	had come into the office on somebody's recommendation because she	needed help in preparing her income tax return.	3.889653405802558
8656. stanley had	filled out the return and because when he was finished it was close	to the lunch hour he had politely asked kitti to join him never expecting	her to accept.	4.881681236755169
8657. blanche knew all this because the door	to stanley's office was open and without straining too hard she could	hear everything that was said.	3.5419526983430734
8658. stanley had gone out saying	he would be back in an hour.	5.951857092190899
8659. he hadn't come back for over two.	5.131969917669621
8660. after that day blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened.	6.782330971766937
8661. there were mornings when stanley came in late afternoons when	he left early days when he didn't come in at all.	4.1075314691341145
8662. blanche	knew something must be causing stanley's new strange behavior but	she never once connected it with kitti walker.	5.057556181613073
8663. then six weeks after the day kitti first came into the office	stanley announced he and kitti were married.	3.9291362225239332
8664. somehow blanche	managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulations.	6.4219634129666225
8665. that night the two of them left for a week's honeymoon	in acapulco.	5.276586742437422
8666. while they were away blanche came into the office	every morning running things as she had always run them for stanley	going through the week in a dazed stupor getting things done automatically	out of habit.	4.64686415738784
8667. for exactly one week she was able to	continue in this manner.	4.67157429141942
8668. on the morning of stanley's return	however her strength left her.	7.604853721505809
8669. two hours of watching his serenely	happy face listening to his soft humming as he bent over his penciled	figures and blanche had to leave.	3.672232977919187
8670. she stayed away for ten	days.	8.764473609234177
8671. those ten days were like no others that blanche had known.	4.71123924324384
8672. mostly she stayed in bed.	7.712079578137997
8673. she didn't tell anyone even her	mother what was wrong.	4.892221409626493
8674. she refused to have a doctor insisting there	was nothing a doctor could do for her.	6.5842824298884555
8675. right said the fingerprint man.	5.737833442751085
8676. also if you're going	to believe those prints you'll have to look for a killer who's	a top-grade piano player.	6.348125761488206
8677. he demonstrated by playing an	imaginary piano doing a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack.	3.9072530517863884
8678. to make it clearer he shifted to acting out but with no change	of manner the killing of rose mallory.	5.998356956322537
8679. his hands snatched at an	imaginary bucket swooping down hard to grab it and coming away with equal	snap like a ball that's been bounced hard.	3.537873559276551
8680. in the same way he	pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that pressing his	hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that.	5.760972061810021
8681. he was moving	like a ballet dancer playing for laughs.	5.119057942974641
8682. if rose mallory's killer	acted this way catching up with him was going to be a cinch.	7.352797790796637
8683. we'd	know him by his stretch pants and the flowers he'd wear twined	in his hair.	3.993406827374322
8684. perhaps if felix had first come upon us when this	boy was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall outside the murdered	woman's apartment we might have had less trouble convincing felix	of our seriousness.	5.069702611522808
8685. this you will remember was still new year's	day.	4.809564317192014
8686. by the time felix turned up it was early afternoon which one	would think would be late enough so that by then except for small children	and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up it could have	been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active	interest in the previous night's noisemakers and paper hats.	4.690517847663469
8687. he had retained his hat and his horn	and	whatever fun might still be going he was ready to join it.	4.306606993256019
8688. that incidentally	might give you some idea of what felix was like.	7.494916827105788
8689. after	all he hadn't happened upon us in that second-floor hall without warning.	4.443274165183679
8690. the me's boys had finished their on-the-spot examination	and the body had been removed for autopsy.	4.827508206929211
8691. the meat wagon therefore	was not out in front of the house any more but the cluster	of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs	to screen any comings and goings.	3.9558476687600903
8692. there was furthermore the	crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a couple more cops	to hold them at a decent distance.	5.365196706432038
8693. just put yourself in felix's	place for a moment.	5.456278710744834
8694. you're a taxpayer householder landlord.	7.712079578137997
8695. you've been away from home for the new year festivities but now	the party is over and you come home.	4.8808237872772295
8696. defining sobriety in the limited	sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol	ingested and not yet eliminated from the system you are sober.	5.031986448310434
8697. you still have your paper hat and you're wearing it but then	it is an extraordinary paper hat and in addition to anything else	you may be you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame	out in the back yard.	3.7651346116460354
8698. it's not too much to assume that you will	have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will mr average	citizen.	5.371426386805402
8699. you have your paper horn clutched in your big craggy	fist and for your entrance you have planned a noisy colorful and exuberant	greeting to your friends and tenants.	3.662072602278367
8700. you find your house a	focus of public and police attention.	7.413732728610986
8701. can you imagine yourself forgetting	under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and	unexpected situation so unsuitably hatted and armed with a paper horn?	3.9286260141459017
8702. 	maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness.	6.743273855772659
8703. you shoulder	your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to	the	cop on the door.	4.088388599691823
8704. you identify yourself and ask him what's going	on.	7.689338099949349
8705. instead of answering you he sticks his head in the door and shouts	up the stairs.	4.494098743116534
8706. got the upstairs guy he bellows.	7.163184125958424
8707. do i send him up?	7.1850342678031
8708.  then he turns back to you.	9.1341940196569
8709. go	on in he says.	6.162967476035402
8710. they'll tell you what's cooking.	7.712079578137997
8711. even then as you go into the house oppressed by the knowledge that	something is cooking and that your house has passed under this unaccountable	official control could you go on forgetting that you still had	that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish	horn in your hand?	3.2178416635695473
8712.    what i'm getting at is that we	were fully prepared for felix's being an odd one.	5.6706095981564175
8713. we'd seen his	handiwork out in the back yard and the little his tenants had told us	of him did make him sound a little special.	4.01506736551405
8714. we were not however prepared	for anything like the apparition that confronted us as felix came	up the stairs.	5.643881994749585
8715. he of course must have been equally unprepared for	what confronted him but nonetheless i did find his reaction startling.	3.9621960797284013
8716. if felix was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn	because he'd forgotten about them he now remembered.	5.335892751045974
8717. he came bounding	up the stairs and joined the dance.	4.823180721177295
8718. he adjusted the hat lifted	the horn to his lips as though it were a flute and fell in alongside	our fingerprint expert to cavort with him.	5.07577659336777
8719. our man stopped	dead and glowered at felix.	5.478525998767374
8720. felix threw his head back and laughed a	laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house.	4.920292053327142
8721. this	was a bull of a man.	5.274951886361598
8722. he was big-chested big-shouldered and heavy-armed.	8.524995147246532
8723. his face was ruddy and heavy and unlined and when he laughed	he showed his teeth which were big and white and strong and unquestionably	home-grown.	3.664239744856786
8724. i don't remember ever seeing teeth that were quite	so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not dentures.	6.111968241262886
8725. his	hair had receded most of the way to the back of his neck.	6.751669021101521
8726. he had only	a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short.	6.370257264135987
8727. it was almost as white	as his teeth.	5.6175275681870795
8728. for a man of his mass he was curiously short.	9.32274918003541
8729. he	wasn't a dwarf but he was a bit of a comic figure.	5.9341674785625145
8730. a man with so big	and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arms	is expected to stand taller than five feet five.	5.248357658582312
8731. for felix it was	a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement.	4.220017048749589
8732. the man was just this	side of being a freak.	6.998327189438216
8733. we waited till he had finished laughing	and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him.	4.030344310276697
8734. he was dressed	in a manner esquire might suggest for the outdoor man's	country weekend.	6.035859266067051
8735. dark gray sports jacket lighter gray slacks pink flannel	shirt black silk necktie.	4.0683852436856025
8736. he was freshly	shaved and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have	missed detecting some scent of it on the massive gusts of his laughter.	5.457350955634549
8737. eventually he subsided.	7.88885195322439
8738. me he said merrily.	8.457718703298294
8739. that much latin we remember gibby said dryly.	5.515712023288047
8740. you	always live up to your name always like this always making happy?	5.9382689449172865
8741. 	i try felix said blithely.	5.619635421798327
8742. the world is full	of blokes who put their hearts into making the tragic scene.	6.111235507522798
8743. i've	never noticed that it improves things any.	4.913686410369733
8744. bully for you	gibby said.	8.457718703298294
8745. what's the rest of your name?	6.756744227670946
8746.    no	rest of it.	9.52328749892442
8747. felix is all there is.	5.619635421798327
8748. all there ever	was?	11.6172286979253
8749.    the past i leave to historians felix intoned	demonstrating that he could be pompous as well as happy.	4.635398945361269
8750. you	live in the present?	8.457718703298294
8751.    in the present felix proclaimed.	7.072504162957989
8752. is there any other time in which a man	can live?	9.232347925271768
8753.    we gibby announced are not philosophers.	5.905279144285114
8754. we are assistant district attorneys.	10.008052052988113
8755. this gentleman is a police	officer.	5.840583368462051
8756. he is a fingerprint specialist.	10.884562573875067
8757. could your future your	immediate future be made to include taking us upstairs giving us a	bit of space in which our friend can work and making available to him	your finger tips?	3.5740295832155744
8758.    the happy one could never have looked	happier.	5.874347790377797
8759. this was more than joy.	8.048462845075997
8760. those lovely	whorls he chortled.	10.572295709343965
8761. come right	along.	8.397706468507176
8762. he was prancing along the	hall heading for the next flight of stairs.	6.961225851543883
8763. we're here because of what happened last night he said.	4.317068102383446
8764. since it is important for the record	let's have the full name.	8.315947160910177
8765. grubb felix whispered.	6.939425769494729
8766. felix grubb?	11.155741451300253
8767.  gibby asked not bothering to whisper.	5.219666477665999
8768. i can't see what would	make it necessary for you to know.	6.752244438107945
8769. nothing could make it necessary	to proclaim it to the whole world.	5.495180774432451
8770. obligingly gibby lowered	his voice.	8.457718703298294
8771. edmund but	not for years.	6.162967476035402
8772. for years it's been just felix.	8.40793191715486
8773. first thing i did	after my twenty-first birthday was go into court and have it officially	changed and this is something i don't tell everybody.	4.035435969340521
8774. that was	almost forty years ago.	9.195935429839754
8775. having volunteered that he was a man	of about sixty he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered	the number less credible.	4.272361495962505
8776. this was a broth of a boy our felix and	nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in demonstrating how agile	he was and how full of juice and spirit.	4.928622878585536
8777. we followed him up the	stairs.	6.445566847172575
8778. the cops would gather up connor and the foursome on the third	floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting.	4.426391855976781
8779. you may think we didn't need nancy and jean	but you always get what you can when you can and we had no guarantee	that a fingerprint record on them couldn't be useful before we were	through with this case.	3.5780445462244947
8780. also if we had excluded the ladies we would	have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where	we stood.	5.378960145825767
8781. the killer if in our present group would certainly be	interested in knowing that much and even though with the fingerprint	evidence what it was i could see no way he could use this bit of information	to improve on his situation there might always be some way.	3.142203143901775
8782. if	you can possibly avoid it you don't hand out any extra chances.	5.817280239207134
8783. felix took us into his studio.	5.219666477665999
8784. it was that oddly shaped space	at the very top of the house where ceiling heights had to accommodate	themselves to the varying angles of roof slope.	5.940878577945217
8785. at each angle of its	pitch a big skylight had been fitted into the roof and all these skylights	were fitted with systems of multiple screens and shades.	3.57443834045697
8786. when felix first opened the door on it all these shades were tightly	drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night.	5.333526578832521
8787. he quickly fixed	that rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens	on the others.	4.427254419348434
8788. he flew about the place making these adjustments	and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience.	5.176611778795778
8789. none of his movements was tentative.	6.2401105084328226
8790. there was no process of	trial and error.	9.067878710601788
8791. starting with the room completely blacked out as it	was when we came in he unerringly fixed things so that the whole place	was bathed in the maximum of light without at any point admitting	even so much as a crack of glare.	3.7420677733492558
8792. expecting something more-than-average	wacky i was surprised by what we found.	6.050042121022508
8793. there was no display	of either works in progress or of finished work.	4.987220471564897
8794. here and there on	work table or pedestal stood a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin draped	over it.	5.692611801099387
8795. these shapes might have been mad but there was no telling.	5.963701185166909
8796. they were all completely shrouded.	9.521755286224275
8797. the equipment was solid and heavy	and in good condition.	3.9843222565600884
8798. everything was orderly and it seemed to be	arranged for the workman's comfort convenience and efficiency.	5.978525657176076
8799. there	were tools about but they were neatly kept.	4.7136550412507425
8800. there was no confusion	and no litter.	9.922120798982213
8801. supplies of sheet metal were neatly stacked in bins.	4.477601198394805
8802. andy did not see the newspapers the next day.	6.408040373772172
8803. someone on his staff-	he suspected it was ed thornburg- intercepted them and for	this andy was grateful.	3.7733169261630146
8804. he finally fell asleep around six in	the morning with the aid of a sleeping capsule a crutch he rarely used	and didn't awaken until early afternoon.	4.92374890941357
8805. memory flooded him the	instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach.	4.106508820154221
8806. outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day.	7.181058177051125
8807. presumably	the same sun was shining upon little drew also and those who had kidnapped	him.	4.41306282375427
8808. but where?	13.042504254880084
8809.  it was still a very big world despite all	the modern cant to the contrary.	4.846957577815399
8810. hub was sitting in a chair that	blocked the hall door.	6.077384115992293
8811. he was dozing perhaps the only sleep he'd	gotten.	5.401752651115104
8812. he snapped to alertness at andy's entrance.	7.042834174643505
8813. lot of people waiting to see you though.	5.008697918691709
8814. questions	about the show tonight.	8.457718703298294
8815. hub picked up the telephone.	6.580320641193773
8816. shall i	let them know you're awake?	7.280987709799153
8817.    i suppose.	9.686204316035266
8818. how's lissa	do you know?	8.457718703298294
8819.    hub considered.	8.12896173865557
8820. she's	got plenty of guts mr paxton.	7.163184125958424
8821. you want me to call her?	6.478673209080925
8822. 	she expecting me to?	8.457718703298294
8823.  hub shook his head so andy told	him not to bother.	4.317068102383446
8824. the only reason for contacting lissa was to comfort	or to be comforted.	5.840558287606259
8825. he could not manage the former or expect the	latter; they had nothing to give to each other.	4.471966295116001
8826. the omission might	look peculiar to outsiders but andy could not bring himself to go through	the motions simply for the sake of appearances.	4.73263193596663
8827. he had little	time to himself anyway.	6.44580582044862
8828. as the afternoon sped toward evening	the suite saw a steady procession of paxton aides pass in and out each	with his own special problem.	5.562139600335666
8829. thornburg arrived with the writers.	5.619635421798327
8830. they had spent the morning revising the act eliminating all the gay	songs patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations.	6.12568456229387
8831. what	remained lacked the original verve but it was at least dignified	as befitting the tragic circumstances.	4.43740061410821
8832. raymond fox reported that the	orchestra had hastily rehearsed cradle song in case it was needed.	5.260133014920431
8833. charlie marble was back and forth on several occasions first	to confer with andy on the advisability of cancelling the las vegas	engagement- they decided it was wise- and later to announce that	a prominent comedian also an agency client had agreed to fill the casino's	open date.	3.4037212305516507
8834. and once bake slipped in pale and drawn last	night's liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it.	5.525507449660318
8835. he asked if there was anything he could do.	5.3526857512892105
8836. andy invented a job to	keep him busy sending him ahead to el dorado to supervise last minute	arrangements.	5.057556181613073
8837. but from rocco vecchio they heard nothing.	5.8183092242455725
8838. at last it was time to depart.	9.141305424754595
8839. hub nosing about spotted	reporters in the lobby so andy was hustled away quietly through the	hotel's service entrance in a strange car which hub had procured somewhere.	3.3515864650355898
8840. they succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel but	there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub.	5.791467097398296
8841. el dorado	was surrounded by a mob.	5.310141763624369
8842. they overflowed the parking lot making progress	by automobile difficult.	6.546767745283227
8843. long before he reached the protection of	the stage door andy was recognized.	4.7777551351691345
8844. word of his arrival spread through	the crowd like a brushfire.	6.465736317666315
8845. they surged around him fingers pointing	eyes prying.	5.295767400278317
8846. it was not a hostile gathering but andy sensed the	difference from last night's hero-worshippers.	6.709451521965807
8847. they had come not	to admire but to observe.	5.922090369568087
8848. it's worse inside thornburg	informed andy.	7.712079578137997
8849. skolman's jammed in every table he could find.	4.6724501027054846
8850. under the heading of it's an ill wind et cetera.	6.939500738711858
8851. backstage	was tomblike by contrast.	6.162967476035402
8852. andy's co-workers kept their distance	awed by the tragedy.	6.412214371980113
8853. but in his dressing room was a large bouquet	and a card that read we're with you all the way.	3.9948442215946156
8854. it was signed	by everyone in the troupe.	7.711906994129459
8855. andy couldn't help but be touched.	5.219666477665999
8856. he instructed shirl winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted	on the call board.	5.359155085025082
8857. bake was waiting to report that lou duvol	had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently.	4.6175942546420305
8858. andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment.	6.360539100351561
8859. bake himself	looked better; any kind of job was better than brooding.	4.881318000812348
8860. andy told him bake i wish you'd talk to skolman see if	some kind of p a system can be rigged up outside.	4.758972536424235
8861. it's just barely	possible with this crowd that the kidnapper wasn't able to get	a table.	3.8849121559715263
8862. i wouldn't want him to miss the message.	7.342818796494033
8863. skolman isn't going to like it much though giving away	what he should be selling.	4.1234897103696415
8864. skolman wasn't the only one who	didn't care for andy's scheme.	6.5640117032906025
8865. a short time later lieutenant	bonner stomped into the dressing room.	4.7563636405890595
8866. i got a bone to pick with	you mr paxton.	6.92658051319512
8867. andy	rolled up the revised script he had been studying.	5.2450711235408285
8868. what about them?	11.868433137946862
8869. 	they're going to louse me up good.	4.913686410369733
8870. my men have been	here all afternoon setting up for this thing.	6.258958312534066
8871. bonner explained	that with the nightclub's cooperation the police had occupied el	dorado like a battlefield.	3.8849121559715263
8872. motion picture cameras had been installed	to film the audience the reservation list was being checked out name	by name and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot	scrutinizing automobiles for a possible lead.	4.582119450011938
8873. however it was virtually	impossible to screen the mob outside even if bonner had manpower	available for the purpose.	4.155249092531645
8874. i want you to have the speakers taken	out.	9.060410657517044
8875. seems like we're never going to see	eye to eye lieutenant.	4.317068102383446
8876. didn't they tell you what i wanted the p	a system for?	6.079650194845684
8877.    sure i know.	7.124300056378861
8878. but it's such a	long shot-   no longer than yours.	7.143224586309399
8879. what do you expect	to get tonight anyway?	6.5696161308774235
8880.  you think somebody is going to stand up in	the audience and make guilty faces?	6.926803078383298
8881.  or have a sign on his car that	says 'here	comes the paxton kidnapper'?	4.552272660556973
8882.  andy crumbled the	script in his fist.	7.163184125958424
8883. i can't stop you from doing what you think	is right.	4.653836632802373
8884. but don't try to stop me either.	8.452405928112324
8885. someday	bonner said you're going to ask us for help.	4.6832537129803065
8886. what you don't understand is that i'm asking	for it now.	6.587789884129474
8887. but bonner departed still full of ill will.	5.052146616597653
8888. he	had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination; he had to	cling to routine tested procedures.	5.013193434989727
8889. to act otherwise would be to admit	his helplessness.	5.84331537171023
8890. but admit or not bonner was helpless.	7.343223252109154
8891. the	crime showed too much planning the kidnappers appeared too proficient	to be caught by a checklist.	3.8101576301595865
8892. andy's performance was scheduled	for eleven o'clock.	7.163184125958424
8893. he stalled for a half-hour longer hoping to	hear something from vecchio about the ransom money.	3.9072530517863884
8894. bake and shirl	winter on separate telephones could not reach him at any conceivable	location in los angeles nor could they secure any clear-cut information	regarding his efforts.	5.046061431415965
8895. the sweaty bastard's	probably halfway to peru with our money by now.	3.78019698820429
8896. when no one	smiled he felt constrained to add just kidding natch.	6.33278609455003
8897. thornburg popped in to advise andy skolman's sending up	smoke signals.	4.317068102383446
8898. you about ready?	13.00203517755798
8899.    what's he complaining	about?	6.939425769494729
8900.  bake asked.	12.525324559949516
8901. they're drinking aren't they?	6.162967476035402
8902. 	no.	13.921774766768346
8903. we got a bunch of sippers out there tonight.	5.3607040037523745
8904. i guess	nobody wants to pass out and miss anything.	6.662548872677544
8905. thornburg added in a	lower voice but andy overheard they act more like a jury than an	audience.	3.9517578393226027
8906. andy said well i guess we can't wait any	longer.	6.144814417540349
8907. hub you stick by the stage door.	4.913686410369733
8908. if rock shows up during	the number- or you hear anything- give me the signal.	5.793164518428573
8909. shirl winter said i'll stay on the phone mr paxton.	4.498469408577486
8910. there's	a couple of call-backs i can work on.	6.412214371980113
8911. you're	a sweetheart- but leave one line open.	4.913686410369733
8912. he may try to phone us.	9.335747162854936
8913. andy	passed into the corridor their good lucks! following him.	4.477601198394805
8914. it was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded	different as if he really needed it.	5.744384093376012
8915. the	act cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon	had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone.	3.685338251241182
8916. the result had nothing	of the polish pace or cohesion of the previous night.	5.635937945771437
8917. here's where	luck would normally step in.	5.219666477665999
8918. but this was no ordinary show and andy	knew it.	7.613686926846282
8919. whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it.	5.668977686294181
8920. the audience had come not to be entertained but to judge.	6.641282031094025
8921. twenty-four	hours had changed him from a performer to a freak.	4.317068102383446
8922. within this	framework what followed was strained even macabre.	7.471614650627471
8923. eliminating	the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs	of equal melancholy.	3.8101576301595865
8924. the effect was as depressing as a gravestone	the applause irresolute and short-lived.	5.527041100229811
8925. yet andy plowed ahead mouthing	the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning and	gradually his listeners warmed to him.	4.139485877939012
8926. their clapping grew more fervent;	the evening was still not beyond salvaging not as a show but for	him as a person.	5.550979947700024
8927. the worst was yet to come.	4.484483010186387
8928. as andy	reached the finale of his act a subdued commotion backstage drew his	attention to the wings.	5.499233222405836
8929. rocco vecchio- a perspiring haggard vecchio-	was standing there flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored	transport guards.	4.016784875282663
8930. vecchio was nodding and pointing at the	large suitcase he held.	5.9245075971793435
8931. andy felt his heart thud heavily with	relief.	4.913686410369733
8932. he waved at fox to cut off the finale introduction.	6.589643136882327
8933. the music	died away discordantly.	5.098202453568707
8934. he drew a deep breath.	8.132854117812016
8935. ladies and gentlemen	in place of my regular closing number tonight i'd like to sing	something of a different nature for you.	3.6133950999028404
8936. ray if you please- the	'cradle song'.	7.163184125958424
8937. he sensed rather than heard the gasp	that swept across the audience.	4.318068015596563
8938. nor could he blame them.	9.260665106749666
8939. this particular	song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate	in bad taste callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency.	3.6185166534735234
8940. having no choice he plunged into it anyway holding onto the microphone	for support.	5.881142607470881
8941. lullaby and goodnight h   his	voice shook.	5.219666477665999
8942. for the first time in his life he forgot the lyrics midway	through and had to cover up by humming the rest.	6.511531413173273
8943. he wondered if the	audience would let him finish.	4.862373123883983
8944. they did; though contemptuous	they were still polite.	7.2676208602133485
8945. but when he was finally through their scorn	was made apparent.	6.207988106999
8946. someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped.	7.275379690538903
8947. otherwise the silence was complete.	6.77304619985467
8948. as the lights came up andy	could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward	the exit.	6.0425489277052
8949. my god he muttered.	7.248949544040654
8950. hub was there to support him.	7.163184125958424
8951. the money's here all of it.	4.484814815711922
8952. at this moment	all he could think of was what he'd been forced to undergo.	6.23598497703147
8953. did	you hear them?	6.939425769494729
8954.  do you know what they think of me?	8.213570399708631
8955. 	bunch of damn jerks hub growled.	5.219666477665999
8956. who needs them?	12.264571591864906
8957. 	thornburg patted his arm.	6.162967476035402
8958. sure andy it'll be all right.	7.296241194802454
8959. nothing broken that can't be mended.	6.019724534639769
8960. thornburg	knew better than any of them that a public image was as fragile	as humpty dumpty.	5.666970948178582
8961. all the king's horses and all the king's	men h   vecchio shouldered in.	5.324760842311568
8962. god knows	how but i got it.	8.216824894952167
8963. you'll never believe the places i've been	today.	4.981924502722124
8964. i practically had to sign your life away you'll probably fire	me for some of the deals i had to go for but-   andy	nodded dully.	5.8650170058378555
8965. we've done our part.	6.162967476035402
8966. he clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing	room.	6.774560012641317
8967. the usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent;	the place had the air of a morgue.	3.7347251164142237
8968. andy had no desire to linger himself	but hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the	efforts of the police to disperse them.	4.849490884287056
8969. his son watched until he got as far as the hall almost out of	sight then hurried after.	4.380660570826508
8970. he caught	up with the old man in the living room.	8.075388500761646
8971. old man arthur had put down	the suitcase to open the front door.	4.676032272172738
8972. just this one favor	dad.	10.672865780774206
8973. just don't tell ferguson that crazy opinion of yours.	5.166737183169329
8974. why not?	15.017578564343802
8975.  the old man gave the room a stare in leaving; under	the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory.	3.5267126728445124
8976. the bartlett girl was killed by	mr dronk's son.	5.650577481330174
8977. rossi and ferguson have been across the street	talking to the kid.	4.182602481535312
8978. they've found some sort of new evidence a bundle	of clothes or something and it must link the kid even stronger	to the crime.	4.968316840249128
8979. why won't you accept facts?	6.851344250050544
8980.  the two kids were together	a lot they were having some kind of teen-age affair- god knows	how far that had gone- and the kid's crippled.	4.978562068163642
8981. he limps and the	man who hit you and took the cane he limped.	4.083443138568456
8982. my god how much	more do you want?	7.588095042322001
8983.    his father looked him over closely.	6.03849001665134
8984. you	sound like an old woman.	7.712079578137997
8985. you should have gone to work today 'stead	of sneaking around spying on the dronk house.	4.56436815976533
8986. now	see here-   the trouble with you old man arthur	began and then checked himself.	5.564762550030357
8987. young mrs arthur had opened the	oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits.	4.781228659308619
8988. the old man opened	the door and stepped out into the sunlight.	6.561617013933007
8989. isn't enough time	to go into it he finished and slammed the door in his son's face.	3.744109221929566
8990. mrs holden turned from the window draperies.	7.4670425242070335
8991. they	found something else up there she said half-aloud to the empty room.	4.0683852436856025
8992. they took it away overalls or something.	7.265189487660029
8993. she walked restlessly	across the room then back to the windows.	5.506075806404659
8994. now they've gone	they didn't come back and they didn't arrest that dronk boy.	5.928044788472589
8995. she stood frowning and chewing her lip.	5.4558319364004175
8996. she was wearing a brown cotton	dress cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her	look slimmer a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleats below.	5.342579185130659
8997. she	smoothed the skirt sat down then stood up and went back to the windows.	4.630371178920363
8998. why on earth did i send him off to work?	7.3070867730419415
8999.  there was excuse	enough to keep him home h that young mr arthur's still over	there.	4.472199142239573
9000. with sudden energy she went to the phone and rang	holden's office and asked for him.	6.613334468161778
9001. i think you had better	come home.	7.444393898778491
9002. mr crosson's	been on everybody's neck an order he expected didn't come through	and he's-   i don't care.	5.40761125120987
9003. i'm	all alone and certain things are going on that look very ominous.	4.0683852436856025
9004. i	need someone to go out and find out what's happening.	6.709345904821816
9005. but	i couldn't do that even if i were home! his voice grew	high and trembling.	4.263039983241311
9006. i can't be underfoot every time those cops turn	around! they'll h they'll think i did something.	5.415610656588604
9007. he couldn't see the grin that split her mouth; the teeth that	shone into the phone were like a shark's.	3.6606271074526586
9008. you'll just have	to risk it.	7.712079578137997
9009. you can't wander along in the dark can you?	6.2387800054692075
9010.  i'd	think that you h even more than i h would be wondering what they're	up to.	5.392685494746782
9011. they found some clothes she tossed in.	5.742794456614989
9012. what?	13.921774766768346
9013. 	deliberately she ignored the yelp.	5.619635421798327
9014. also that mr	ferguson was here.	8.91706758711773
9015. i guess he wants to ask you some questions.	5.4033626759905244
9016. he doesn't expect you until five.	7.5139871259533155
9017. then	i'd better wait until five.	5.619635421798327
9018. no h o h o.	8.98760341334402
9019. she slapped the receiver into its holder and stepped	away.	4.892221409626493
9020. her eyes were bright with anticipation.	8.219197736138074
9021. in his office	mr holden replaced the phone slowly.	5.543586103648914
9022. he rose from his chair.	8.132854117812016
9023. he had to cough then; he went to the window and choked there with	the fresh breeze on his face.	4.843959061585873
9024. he got his hat out of the closet.	8.94984984363426
9025. for	a moment he thought of going into crosson's office to explain that	he had to leave but there was now such a pain in his chest such a	pounding in his head that he decided to let it go.	3.67891529868919
9026. he passed the receptionist	in the outer office muttering i've got to go out for	a little while.	5.61710458488467
9027. let her call crosson if she wanted to let crosson	raise the roof or even can him he didn't care.	3.924064969668878
9028. he got into	the car.	9.979379819543631
9029. putting the key into the switch pressing the accelerator	with his foot putting the car into reverse seemed vast endeavors almost	beyond the ability of his shaking body.	3.3893905914746862
9030. once out in the street	the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken.	6.849048663122572
9031. when he	turned into the highway that led to the outskirts of the city and then	rose toward home he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few	minutes sucking in air and squinting and blinking his eyes to clear	them of tears.	3.9656000852125617
9032. what on earth was in mae's mind that she wanted	him up there spying on what the cops were doing?	5.261244804872409
9033.  what did she	think he could do?	6.209544219398333
9034.    he tried to ignore what his own common sense	told him but it wasn't possible; her motives were too blatant.	5.3158983871687715
9035. she wanted him to get into trouble.	6.225440987049141
9036. she wanted the police to notice	him suspect him.	7.057872112361533
9037. she was going to keep on scheming poking prodding	suggesting and dictating until the cops got up enough interest in	him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions.	3.8578168470118155
9038. and he knew	in that moment with a cold sinking of despair a dying of old hopes	that mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors.	5.211274409991563
9039. nothing bald open; but enough.	6.584511284985274
9040. they'd have some suspicions to repeat	to the police.	6.412214371980113
9041. though his inner thoughts cringed at it	he forced himself to think back recreating the scene in which mae claimed	to have caught him molesting the child.	3.6959685786562106
9042. it hadn't amounted	to anything.	10.311703722752974
9043. there had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions.	5.886628719799909
9044. a second scene flashed before his mind the interior of	the garage at the new house and the young bartlett girl turning startled	to meet him the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then	the brightness as mae had clicked on the light.	4.418212856462161
9045. suppose the	cops somehow got hold of that?	5.520402284828592
9046.    well it hadn't been	what it seemed he'd had no idea the girl was in there.	5.753813542349443
9047. and when he came to examine the scene there was	a certain staginess to it it had the smell of planning and a swift	suspicion darted into his mind.	3.732424819560039
9048. mae	wouldn't have plotted a thing like that.	6.743273855772659
9049. it was just that little	accidents played into her hands.	5.013734935451312
9050. he leaned	on the wheel clutching it staring into the sunlight and tried to bring	order into his thoughts.	5.574882612796271
9051. he felt light-headed and sick.	6.548063796243271
9052. there was	no use wandering off into a territory of utter nightmare.	6.756753795381824
9053. she was married to him for better or for worse.	5.697869087473695
9054. she wouldn't	be wilfully planning his destruction.	8.037204458577536
9055. even as the conviction of truth roared through him shattering	his last hope of safety he was reaching to release the hand brake	to head up the road for home doing her bidding.	3.5574479773036125
9056. he drove and the	road wobbled familiar scenes crept past on either side.	5.752586250134144
9057. he came to a	stretch of old orange groves the trees dead some of them uprooted	and then there was an outlying shopping area and tract houses.	4.251360373146683
9058. he had	the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to	hide.	5.624005085211987
9059. but he couldn't imagine where.	7.295075116393168
9060. there was really no place to	go finally except home to mae.	6.957141570391518
9061. at the gate he slowed looking	around.	6.381865837134412
9062. cooper was beside his car on the curb at the right just	standing there morosely; he didn't even look up.	5.173865203866706
9063. behind him on the	steps of the little office sat old man arthur; he was straight	something angry in his attitude as if he might be waiting to report	something.	3.816659764291982
9064. holden stepped on the gas.	8.222027153160505
9065. a new idea drifted in from	nowhere.	6.1169200693077475
9066. he could go to the police.	10.817319627264393
9067. he could tell them his fears	of being involved he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood	and how mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him-	the scene was complete in his mind at the moment even to his	own jerkings	and snivelings and ferguson's silent patience.	3.757465869786777
9068. he could throw	himself on the mercy of the police department.	7.447980061684891
9069. it wasn't	what mae would want him to do though.	5.901752832824116
9070. he was sure of this.	9.356706468819409
9071. once	he had abandoned himself to the very worst once he had quieted all	the dragons of worry and suspense there wouldn't be very much for	mae to do.	3.6902034449208876
9072. at that moment holden almost slammed on the brakes to go	back to cooper and ask if ferguson was about.	5.6119337595508165
9073. it would be	such a relief.	7.774118595383686
9074. what was that old sign supposed to be painted	over a door somewhere abandon hope all ye who enter here?	6.010166900911587
9075. 	why holden said to himself surprised at his own sudden insight	i'll bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can	be.	3.4707540517505726
9076. they've worried they've lain awake nights they've shook	at the slightest footstep they've pictured their own destruction and	now it's all over and they can give up.	4.819236792111778
9077. sure they're giving up	hope.	6.306395596579972
9078. hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension.	6.6203840456951335
9079. holden waved a hand at the empty street.	4.823631841853791
9080. glad to	see you go.	8.457718703298294
9081. he drove into the paved space before the garage	and got out slamming the car door.	4.022942849290681
9082. he looked up and down the street.	8.900196296732267
9083. if ferguson's car had been in sight holden would have walked	directly to it.	4.719555633936084
9084. he went to the front door and opened it and looked	in.	7.765321429633115
9085. mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen.	4.317068102383446
9086. she had a cup of something steaming coffee perhaps in one hand a	fresh piece of toast in the other.	5.915857936103887
9087. she stood there watching holden	come in and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner	with a huge chomp of her white teeth.	3.4838016175087727
9088. mae-	i've been thinking she said swallowing the toast.	6.412214371980113
9089. didn't	you have an old pair of painting overalls in the garage?	4.182602481535312
9090.  you	used them that time you painted the porch at our other house.	5.583228874976599
9091. and then	you wiped up some grease.	5.662844612144823
9092. she had caught him off guard	no preparation nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster.	6.115919182047227
9093. what do you-   i've been	looking for them and they're gone.	5.347444774802265
9094. i'm sure they were in the garage	up until a couple of days ago.	7.566268993060115
9095. you used to paint	in them and then you just took them for rags.	4.513285967080587
9096. the police have them	now.	7.420952352186206
9097. i don't remember any overalls at all.	5.406629921006237
9098. worn through at the knees.	7.712079578137997
9099. she stood sipping	and chewing and watching.	5.856547304788402
9100. green paint wasn't it?	8.622269347616264
9101.  well	i'm not sure of the color.	5.219666477665999
9102. mae	sit down.	11.155741451300253
9103. put down the cup of coffee.	6.05367462736491
9104. tell me what this is all about.	7.179568450011907
9105. she took another bite of toast.	6.327436003776391
9106. holden	noticed almost absently how she chewed how the whole side of her	cheek moved a slab of fat that extended down into her neck.	4.714137561967006
9107. my goodness	you ought to remember if i do.	5.2063673323678
9108. you're going to have to go	to the police and explain what happened.	6.827751670877959
9109. tell them the truth h or	something h before they come here.	4.227746230212016
9110. a seeping coldness entered	holden's being; his nerves seemed frost-bitten down to the tips	of his tingling fingers and his spine felt stiff and glass-like liable	to break like an icicle at any moment.	4.68613697336972
9111. i've never owned any	painting overalls.	5.619635421798327
9112. a man with a sketch pad in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small	office at the end of a long dim corridor and made pencil lines on paper	and said is this more like it mrs macready?	5.468855003318094
9113.  or are	the eyebrows more like this?	6.121316975153239
9114.  when he had finished with that he	would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to	someone else most probably a busboy.	6.125886871460801
9115. begin to look like him now	would you say?	5.377831536383565
9116.  different about the mouth huh?	8.344747956608707
9117.  more like this	maybe?	9.175516449440797
9118.    men blew dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth	floor of the hotel dumont and blew it off again and did the same	in a tiny almost airless room in a tenement in the west forties.	4.8020048391515715
9119. and men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms sucking dust up once	more.	4.165017398271185
9120. men from the third detective district eighteenth precinct	had the longest the most tedious job.	6.025912572110211
9121. at the hotel dumont	there had at the time in issue been twenty-three overnighters counting	couples as singular.	5.227186551955606
9122. these included as one mr and mrs	anthony payne who had checked in a little after noon the day before	and had not checked out together.	4.972048903093123
9123. but gardner willings was not	included; he had been at the dumont for almost a week.	4.72157865486348
9124. there was	of course no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought	had stayed only overnight at the hotel.	6.751600984989489
9125. the twenty-three	provided merely a place to	start and their identification was the barest of starts.	3.570845587849075
9126. with names	and addresses listed verification came next.	7.780650938111837
9127. it would take time;	it would almost inevitably trouble some water.	5.662706396537184
9128. not at the dumont last night and my husband couldn't have been.	7.050572205534278
9129. he's	the hotel king	arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems.	4.328002167884295
9130. the king arthur offered respectable and convenient lodgings to people	from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and didn't want- heaven	knew didn't want!- to lunge anxiously through crowded streets	to railroad stations and at odd hours of night drive from smaller stations	to distant homes probably through rain or in november something	worse.	4.204012408823764
9131. the king arthur was less expensive than the dumont.	4.333524338397803
9132. the	king arthur had fifty-four overnighters again counting rooms rather	than people.	5.9245075971793435
9133. failing to find	what was wanted as was most likely check out other guests with special-	but not exclusive- attention to those with rooms on the street.	3.4977049579458153
9134. and	know while all this went on that there was no real reason to suppose	that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel.	5.646676745516878
9135. it was not even	certain the shot had been fired from either hotel.	4.953380316090826
9136. there were other	roofs less convenient but not impossible.	7.876888200890349
9137. it is dull business detecting	and hard on feet.	5.155119068720361
9138. there was also the one salient question	to ask and ask widely: did you notice anything out of the way?	6.365132364807159
9139. 	like for example a man carrying a twenty-two rifle probably with	a telescopic sight attached?	4.257246777296951
9140.    there was of course no hope	it really would be that simple.	7.562137311603429
9141. the sniper whether psychopathic marksman	or murderer by intent would hardly have walked to his vantage point	with rifle over shoulder whistling a marching tune.	3.247372700740118
9142. anybody carrying	anything that might hide a rifle?	6.838437298747782
9143.  long thin suitcase?	8.763291260682983
9144.  or long	fat suitcase for that matter?	8.400559839214944
9145.  shrugs met that from room clerks	from bellhops.	4.913686410369733
9146. who measures?	14.985624361366707
9147.  but nothing it appeared long enough	to attract attention.	5.0513976144308055
9148. cases say for musical instruments?	7.712079578137997
9149.  none	noted at the dumont.	6.162967476035402
9150. several at the king arthur.	9.08586349468823
9151. a combo was staying	there.	6.0574501475319265
9152. and had been for a week.	8.588558394244723
9153. anything else?	8.12896173865557
9154.  anything at	all?	11.155741451300253
9155.  shrugs met that.	6.939425769494729
9156. thought for a time he might be on to something.	6.833135733677737
9157. a refuse bin at	the dumont turned up a florist's box- a very long box for very	long-stemmed flowers.	3.8134094051982004
9158. traces of oil on green tissue?	7.163184125958424
9159.  the lab to check.	5.098202453568707
9160. anything at all strange?	9.112342537697801
9161. 	well a man had tried at the king arthur to register with	an ocelot.	3.9701983041559052
9162. at the dumont a guest had come in a collapsible wheel chair.	6.538993427176677
9163. at the king arthur one guest had had his head heavily bandaged	and another had a bandaged foot and had walked with crutches.	3.746343909994639
9164. there	had also been a man who must have had st vitus or something because	he kept jerking his head.	5.7841685011705275
9165. as reports dribbled in william	weigand tossed them into the centrifuge which had become his head.	4.214578020185608
9166. there was no sign of mrs lauren payne at her	house on nod road ridgefield connecticut.	6.206962820181613
9167. the house was modern	large on five acres.	5.281044662941638
9168. the state cops would	check from time to time; pass word when there was word to pass.	5.701625209087455
9169. weigand	tossed this news into the centrifuge.	5.219666477665999
9170. sort things out damn it.	7.712079578137997
9171. sort out the next move.	5.619635421798327
9172. try to forget motive for the moment.	7.692526993534588
9173. only those actually with payne when he was shot	or who had left the party within not more than five minutes	positively had none.	4.478905428767471
9174. the norths; hathaway jerry's	publicity director; livingston birdwood producer of uprising.	5.315964723648707
9175. they had been with payne when he was shot could not therefore	have shot him from above.	5.114763367908209
9176. he had	left after the scuffle; had been seen to leave.	6.130331029301074
9177. he would have had ample	time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey.	4.930699619274723
9178. consider him	seriously therefore?	11.76052059116346
9179.  intangibles entered then- hunches which	felt like facts.	4.913686410369733
9180. willings would ambush certainly; willings undoubtedly	had.	7.163184125958424
9181. willings was presumably a better than average shot.	4.6724501027054846
9182. but-	hunch now- willings would not ambush anything which went on two	legs instead of four.	5.331440467598945
9183. because if for no other reason willings would	never for a moment suppose he was not bigger tougher than anything	else that went on two legs.	4.188798986811323
9184. ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves	as any man may against a tiger.	5.777606556301886
9185. faith constable had	had to go on from the party and had presumably gone on.	4.26764363524176
9186. to	be checked out further.	8.457718703298294
9187. forget motive?	8.12896173865557
9188.  no motive is a part of fact.	9.761421034532079
9189. nobody in his right mind punishes a quarter-century-old dereliction.	4.993198541669088
9190. grudges simply do not keep that well in a sane mind.	5.955933418278419
9191. faith constable	had accomplished much in a quarter of a century.	4.671999689198136
9192. jeopardize it now	to correct so old a wrong?	6.412214371980113
9193.  bill shook his head.	7.177205388764752
9194. also he thought	i doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun.	6.303243486328591
9195. lauren herself?	8.12896173865557
9196.  she had left the party early pleading a headache.	7.664491579858483
9197. no lack of opportunity presuming she had a gun.	5.186089589911694
9198. she might conceivably	have brought one in in a large-enough suitcase.	6.432292157928805
9199. she might now have taken it away again.	5.142927756812074
9200. motive- her	husband wandering?	9.52328749892442
9201.  bitter unreasoning jealousy?	6.939425769494729
9202.  heaven knew	it happened and hell knew it too.	6.4996472828245055
9203. but- it happened almost always	among the primitive and usually among the very young.	3.9701983041559052
9204. there was nothing to indicate that lauren	payne was primitive.	8.348533846184223
9205. she did not move in primitive circles.	5.724364039330378
9206. she	was young but not that young.	7.209563759634995
9207. it occurred to bill weigand	that he was on a hunch basis eliminating a good many.	4.523868216935595
9208. he reminded	himself that all eliminations were tentative.	7.042834174643505
9209. he also reminded himself	that he had an unusual number of possibilities.	5.007925586429326
9210. the masons	mother or son or mother and son?	5.650577481330174
9211.  opportunity was obvious.	6.939425769494729
9212. here too the cause to hate lay well back in the years.	7.541984393742155
9213. but	bitterness had more cause to remain even increasingly to corrode.	4.317068102383446
9214. the boy had apparently- if mrs macready	was right in what she had told mullins- only in recent months	been forced to give up college to work as a busboy.	4.678591626492525
9215. seeing the man	he blamed for this made much of- youth and bitterness and-	bill picked up the telephone; got mullins.	3.8322866200278884
9216. send out a	pickup on mrs mason and the boy when you've got enough to go on	bill said.	5.091749440408223
9217. a	man named lars simon playwright-director had expressed a wish that	anthony payne drop dead.	3.9905711276258518
9218. he would say of course that he had not	really had any such wish; that what he had said was no more than one	of those things one does say lightly meaning nothing.	5.8055150014250145
9219. which probably	would turn out to be true; which he obviously had to be given the	opportunity to say.	5.268999402643392
9220. a man named blaine smythe with y	and e but pronounced without them had been fired at payne's	insistence.	5.476097147083597
9221. he was also if pam north was right a closer acquaintance	of lauren payne's than she now was inclined to admit.	3.955346532323255
9222. he might deny the latter; would certainly deny any connection between	the two things or any connection of either with murder.	5.1739946446432885
9223. he would	have to be given the opportunity.	6.535661000436703
9224. mullins?	13.921774766768346
9225.  it was evident	that mullins was the man to go.	5.221099163814233
9226. it was evident that a captain should	remain at his desk directing with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat.	5.169868914773485
9227. bill weigand was good and tired of the wall opposite and the crack	in the plaster.	4.0625816318575865
9228. let mullins keep the firm seat; let stein.	7.623562774729885
9229. when siamese cats are intertwined it is difficult to tell where	one leaves off and another begins.	4.419236841922907
9230. stilts and shadow on pam's	bed appeared to be one cat- rather large as siamese cats go and	to be sure having two heads and two tails.	5.108063321697619
9231. on the other hand they	or it seemed to have no legs whatever.	6.245293446766605
9232. pamela north said hi	to her cats and added that proper cats met their humans at the door.	5.057556181613073
9233. of four dark brown ears one twitched slightly at this.	4.9959387964504876
9234. i know it isn't dinnertime.	10.021666490711793
9235. but at	this the one too-large cat suddenly became two cats stretching.	4.452373707595423
9236. shadow	the more talkative began at once to talk her voice piteous.	5.9093442923829365
9237. stilts	a more direct cat leaped from the bed and trotted briskly toward	the kitchen.	3.9701983041559052
9238. shadow looked surprised wailed and trotted after her.	6.412214371980113
9239. the hell it isn't dinnertime two waving tails told pam north.	3.78019698820429
9240. it was not whatever tale was told by tails.	7.939953097898569
9241. she might be firm.	7.116861319551038
9242. it was most unlikely that she would	be firm.	7.507067165196958
9243. they want to be fat cats pam thought and lighted a cigarette	and leaned back on a chaise and considered pulling her thoughts together.	3.9287934958830664
9244. after a time it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth	the trouble.	6.454457891133762
9245. a vague feeling that anthony payne had had it coming	was hardly a thought and was in any event reprehensible.	3.930064444950948
9246. had faith	constable's explanation of her confidence so uninvited been a	little thin?	6.415980682556803
9247.  that was more like a thought but not a great deal more.	6.395925986718967
9248. had that tall dark boy carrying trays too heavy for him found what	he might have considered adulation of a man he probably hated more	than he could bear?	5.147460367392587
9249.  and possessed himself- how?	6.8238542111854175
9250. - of a rifle	and killed?	7.712079578137997
9251.  pam found she had no answers; had only a hope.	4.317068102383446
9252. the poor	kid- the poor frail kid.	6.154713990487742
9253. some people have luck and some have no	luck and that whatever people who prefer order say is the size of	it.	3.971938288792481
9254. the poor unlucky-   the telephone rang.	6.3970685018022415
9255. pam realized to	her surprise that she had been almost dozing.	5.1599726185054715
9256. at four o'clock in	the afternoon.	9.378567327430734
9257. two martinis for lunch- that was the trouble.	6.065875904676896
9258. you do remember.	12.984562954974477
9259. you just- hello?	9.474318398684616
9260. 	yes this is she?	8.457718703298294
9261.  what?	10.144513917544229
9262.    the voice had music	in it.	7.199809663374918
9263. even with words coming too fast they came on the music of the	voice.	5.0394547534487755
9264. i said i would pam said.	8.398355257713288
9265. they won't talk	about who gave the information.	5.557815558732673
9266. not unless they have to.	9.408829979339309
9267. not unless they have-   she was	interrupted.	6.242671185362519
9268. call this a cry for help faith constable	said.	6.412214371980113
9269. through a door conveniently unlocked madden supplemented.	5.537291358655719
9270. that damn door said the police chief.	7.787532299577984
9271. a gift horse	to be viewed with suspicion.	4.852263872861348
9272. madden's dark face wore a meditative	look.	7.163184125958424
9273. if there was collusion between an outside murderer and	a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check	on the door later.	4.639042616777118
9274. and it makes a very poor red herring for an inside	job.	6.886439114851914
9275. much better to break a cellar window.	5.805628290229357
9276. don't	forget there was the hope it would pass for a natural death pauling	reminded him.	5.884303707404387
9277. well with a house as big as that there	must be at least one cellar window that wouldn't be noticed right away	unless there was a police investigation.	4.245967644261778
9278. and a	pane of glass isn't hard to-   the telephone interrupted	him.	6.279602923243035
9279. he scooped up the receiver and said police chief into	the mouthpiece and then oh yes mr benson.	3.770206449411329
9280. i was hoping i'd	hear from you today.	8.267388591772093
9281. with his free hand he pulled a pad	and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened saying	uh-huh and i see at intervals.	3.700940661956415
9282. at last he said	well thank you for calling mr benson.	7.89780165220893
9283. although there was	no doubt in my mind and we've been handling it as one i'm glad	to have it made official.	4.0135806294752046
9284. coroner he said	to madden.	8.457718703298294
9285. he's just heard from the pathologist who says mrs	meeker apparently died from suffocation.	4.103111669272146
9286. pauling looked at his	notes.	8.457718703298294
9287. many minute hemorrhages in the lungs; particles of lint	and thread in the mouth and nostrils.	4.2473492467209395
9288. scrapings from the bed linen	identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral cavities.	5.551553835943043
9289. no other cause of death apparent.	7.116024324246315
9290. trachea clear of mucus and foreign	objects.	7.163184125958424
9291. brain examined for thrombosis clot or hemorrhage.	4.913686410369733
9292. no signs	of these no gross hemorrhage of lungs heart brain or stomach.	6.085218198508719
9293. oh the time of death.	8.314891374631888
9294. the duration	of the digestive process varies the pathologist says but the empty	stomach and the findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate	that mrs meeker died several hours after her seven-o'clock	dinner.	4.363009335758746
9295. probably around midnight give or take an hour either way.	4.693827987910206
9296. so there it is he said.	9.236704084525995
9297. not	your problem of course unless johnston and the murderer are one	and the same.	3.9701983041559052
9298. however likely	it was pauling said he couldn't limit himself to it.	6.350365722981737
9299. he had	to look for other prospects other motives until more conclusive evidence	pointing to johnston came to light.	3.770206449411329
9300. madden with his investigation	centered on the fraud said that tomorrow he would go to the bronx	bank through which mrs meeker's checks to johnston had cleared.	4.984405473399737
9301. arthur williams had to be located they agreed.	5.7532880820137615
9302. he might	have been in collusion with johnston on the fraud; he might be mrs	meeker's murderer or have played some part in her death.	4.893816389523863
9303. this	was madden's suggestion; the police chief shook his head over it.	4.2120846458058985
9304. if arthur williams was involved in the fraud or the murder then he	too had another identity.	6.072281775573966
9305. no one the medfield police had questioned	professed to know any more about him than about johnston.	4.2330339315426535
9306. scholarship	applicant?	13.921774766768346
9307.  pauling looked doubtful.	6.939425769494729
9308. madden explained that	he was thinking of an application sent directly to mrs meeker.	5.448482501884564
9309. then he asked to use the phone and called brian thayer who said that	he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two	o'clock.	3.852584342214905
9310. madden said that he would see him at two and made another	call this one to mrs meeker's lawyers.	5.808979670955763
9311. mr hohlbein	was out for the day but mr garth would be free at one-thirty.	4.293297860102934
9312. the	secretary's tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice	was a concession for which madden should be duly grateful.	4.920292053327142
9313. he inferred that hohlbein and garth were high-priced lawyers.	4.645344995261077
9314. he had lunch with pauling.	9.74961741863036
9315. promptly at one-thirty he entered hohlbein	and garth's elegant suite of offices in medfield's newest	professional building.	3.9073578352413523
9316. he disliked garth on sight conservative	clothes and haircut smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man	who must be well into his thirties handclasp too consciously quick and	firm.	4.6045838129405805
9317. youngish man on the make madden labeled him and was ready	to guess that in a correct not too pushing fashion the junior partner	of the firm had political ambitions; that mrs garth would be	impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer; that there	were three children two boys and a girl; that she was active in the	woman's club and he in lions rotary and jaycee; and finally	that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their	wedding day.	3.175889535933472
9318. madden knew that he could be completely wrong about	all this but also knew that he would go right on disliking garth.	5.919441887715494
9319. garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with	fastidious distaste as this unfortunate johnston affair which would	not he said more than once have ever come about if mrs meeker	had only seen fit to consult mr hohlbein or him about it.	3.2837715817418673
9320. madden regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement.	6.2419505514450435
9321. he asked to see a copy of mrs meeker's will.	5.478543459243304
9322. the date october 8 1957 immediately caught	the inspector's eye.	5.467709816875016
9323. was she	in the habit of making new wills?	5.436265287846731
9324.    oh no.	13.80202930292867
9325. she had reason	to change the one she made right after mr meeker's death.	4.563541754041062
9326. her	estate had grown considerably.	8.457718703298294
9327. she wanted to make a more equitable	distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most; particularly	the scholarship fund.	4.235529737526775
9328. at the time the will was drawn mr	hohlbein mentioned to me how mentally alert she seemed for her age	knowing just what changes she wanted made and so forth.	5.384430598040794
9329. mr hohlbein and i have noticed some lapses since	though.	5.5800982226545495
9330. most of them this past year i'd say.	8.858702121685988
9331. even two or three	years ago i doubt that she'd have become involved in this unfortunate	johnston affair.	4.364569095178956
9332. she'd have consulted us you see.	7.163184125958424
9333. she always	did before and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised.	4.371911722426681
9334. the inspector nodded doubting this.	6.5155523300336915
9335. mrs meeker hadn't	struck him as ready to seek anyone's advise least of all garth's.	4.134660692177377
9336. with her sharp tongue she'd have cut his pompousness to ribbons.	6.370630499504925
9337. it would have been hohlbein who handled her affairs.	7.120079116712782
9338. madden	settled back to read the will.	8.203487765337734
9339. he skimmed over the millions	that went to meeker park medfield hospital the civic center	the public health nursing association the library and so on pausing	when he came to the scholarship fund.	3.6435178954490004
9340. two millions were added to	what had been set aside for it in mrs meeker's lifetime and	the proviso made that as long as brian thayer continued to discharge	his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board	of trustees	he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary commensurate	with the increased responsibilities enlargement of the fund would	entail.	4.785825404895144
9341. a splendid vote of confidence in thayer madden	reflected.	4.618634983627765
9342. he went on to personal	bequests a list of names largely unknown to him.	7.370316109354494
9343. twenty-five thousand	to each of the great-nieces in oregon	ten thousand to this friend and that five thousand	to another; to brian thayer the sum of ten thousand dollars;	to the pecks ten thousand each; to joan sheldon the conditional	bequest of ten thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was	still in mrs meeker's employ at the time of the latter's death.	3.409994347688571
9344. birthday; mrs meeker hadn't got around to taking care	too bad madden thought.	5.583228874976599
9345. joan sheldon had earned	the larger bequest.	5.557015966617597
9346. mr hohlbein was left twenty thousand	garth ten.	7.399847747143991
9347. there were no other names madden recognized.	6.730985631341629
9348. arthur williams's	might well have been included he felt.	6.483965500687191
9349. mrs meeker had	spent a small fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for	him in her will if he should be found after her death and had never	mentioned his name to her lawyers.	3.305666783408392
9350. madden took up this point	with garth who shrugged it off.	5.9245075971793435
9351. old people have their idiosyncrasies.	6.45630889895198
9352. this one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more.	6.089341662868216
9353. well she had a number of them where money was concerned	garth said.	5.713493125732468
9354. sometimes we'd have trouble persuading her to	make tax-exempt charitable contributions and i've known her to quarrel	with a plumber over a bill for fixing a faucet; the next moment	she'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty	thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate johnston	affair.	4.337752018102507
9355. there was no telling how she'd react to spending money.	5.521092624442345
9356. madden inquired next about the audit of the scholarship fund.	5.9245075971793435
9357. there was an annual audit garth informed him.	6.478572129964259
9358. no discrepancies	or shortages had ever been found.	7.9478864935701825
9359. brian thayer was a thoroughly	honest and competent administrator.	4.6724501027054846
9360. his salary had reached the ten thousand	mark.	7.065535338067961
9361. his expenses ran another four or five thousand.	5.424600849836136
9362. the lawyer	didn't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some	dinner party- thayer like himself madden reflected was the extra	man so prized by hostesses- and found him easy enough to talk to.	4.218133526586712
9363. but he didn't play golf didn't seem to belong to any local clubs-	his work took him away a lot of course- which probably accounted	for his tendency to keep to himself.	3.917745147712887
9364. garth's glance began	to flicker to his watch.	6.743273855772659
9365. he said that he had already told the	police chief that he didn't know what insurance man had recommended	johnston to mrs meeker.	4.842744719274441
9366. he would offer no theory to account	for her murder.	7.056895625596033
9367. the whole thing his manner conveyed was so far outside	the normal routine of hohlbein and garth that it practically demanded	being swept under the rug.	3.42912655497026
9368. no doubt mrs meeker had	snubbed him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing.	5.9979497339361
9369. even so	madden's dislike of the suave correct lawyer deepened.	5.129620187441726
9370. it would	be all right with him he decided if his investigation of the fraud	with its probable by-product of murder led to garth's door.	5.246502359460395
9371. at first glance not much of a motive	for a man of his standing; but for all his air of affluence who	could tell what his private financial picture was?	4.261393880418346
9372.    the inspector	knew as he left that this was wishful thinking.	6.102338181211458
9373. nevertheless	he made a mental note to look into garth's financial background.	4.4386559087845185
9374. brian thayer had a downtown address.	7.163184125958424
9375. he lived in an apartment	house not over three or four years old a reclaimed island of landscaped	brick and glass on the fringe of the business district.	3.982546154250151
9376. he	occupied a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor using the second	bedroom as his office.	5.331440467598945
9377. airy and bright the apartment was furnished	with good modern furniture rugs and draperies.	3.9701983041559052
9378. done by a professional	decorator madden thought and somehow as impersonal as unremarkable	as its occupant.	5.331440467598945
9379. in dunston the rent would run close to two hundred	a month; in medfield perhaps twenty-five less not all of it	paid by thayer who could charge off one room on his expense account.	3.477555394471829
9380. he took madden into the room he used as an office.	6.52664332456678
9381. it contained	a desk files a typewriter on a stand and two big leather armchairs.	4.242655138423538
9382. a newspaper open at stock-market reports lay on one of them.	5.934302983921908
9383. thayer	folded it up and offered a drink.	5.158931296670613
9384. to begin the interview he asked if thayer with more time to think	it over could add to what he had said the other day about johnston.	5.126178401935897
9385. it's all i think about too.	5.379496440024552
9386. it's still unbelievable that it was murder.	8.237035721034294
9387. for	all her domineering ways i can't conceive of her having had a deadly	enemy.	4.007299697126937
9388. dammit phil are you trying to wreck my career?	6.166178910620107
9389.  because	that's what you're doing- wrecking it wrecking it wrecking it!	griffith had confronted hoag on the building's front steps-	hoag had been permitted no further- and backed him against a wrought-iron	railing.	3.2847726970144535
9390. his rage had built up as he made his way here from	the second floor helped by the quantity of champagne he had consumed.	5.497621372752319
9391. hoag said i didn't send for you leigh.	4.6724501027054846
9392. i want the	captain in charge.	9.115931308816943
9393. where is he?	8.942830417868336
9394.    phil for god's sake	go away.	7.712079578137997
9395. i told you there's	nothing between midge and me nothing.	5.3024244892671755
9396. it's all in your mind.	7.972251038513795
9397. a	couple of sobs escaped him followed by a sentiment that revealed his	emotional state.	4.433159261033049
9398. why i'm not fit to touch the hem of her garment.	6.464732223806705
9399. leigh get a grip on yourself.	5.219666477665999
9400. it's not about you	or midge.	7.967185197676728
9401. i have some security information about the prime minister.	6.161930704946225
9402. griffith looked at him suspiciously through red-rimmed	eyes.	6.743273855772659
9403. not about me?	8.961136968740286
9404.  you mean it phil?	11.103810394385636
9405.  you wouldn't pull	my leg old man?	6.490824436842797
9406.  i did get you on the platform this morning.	6.653813150583419
9407. i'm not pulling your leg.	5.805525694497741
9408. will you call that captain?	9.60708723044091
9409. 	no use he won't come.	5.619635421798327
9410. he peered closely at hoag	in the gathering darkness.	6.672854314451728
9411. what happened to your head?	7.841269315607588
9412. 	i was hit- knocked out.	7.712079578137997
9413. now will you get him?	6.590362683214186
9414.    he	says i'm to take the message.	8.688451953052402
9415. he stared at hoag drunkenly.	5.926245264679889
9416. who'd hit you in the head?	7.593598645019551
9417.    it doesn't matter.	8.703570778666487
9418. you get back to the captain and tell him this: somebody's going	to take a shot at the prime minister and mahzeer is in on the plot.	5.817975558416321
9419. tell him under no circumstances to trust the prime minister with mahzeer.	4.326459297085299
9420. mahzeer's	the ambassador.	11.155741451300253
9421. griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne	fuzz that encased it.	4.536268643969308
9422. i'll show you how wrong you are.	6.743273855772659
9423. mahzeer	and the prime minister are alone right now.	4.6724501027054846
9424. so that proves it!   hoag looked terrified.	7.995050135605976
9425. where	are they?	8.216872220255128
9426.    where'd you expect the john?	7.712079578137997
9427.  mahzeer's	office.	10.144513917544229
9428. where is that?	12.27265020945495
9429.    facing us	two flights up.	6.289447700272293
9430. look old man you can't go up.	7.90971865050038
9431. they won't even	let you in the front door.	5.253762796964501
9432. so why don't you be a good boy and-	hoag grabbed him by the shoulders.	6.71569469505322
9433. if you want to spend another day in the state department- another	day- you get in there and tell that captain what i told you.	4.400502002144087
9434. he bit out the words.	8.132854117812016
9435. and you know i can do it.	6.0546523612052665
9436. easy does it phil.	8.6526849794965
9437. i'm on my way.	6.162967476035402
9438. he turned and fled into the house and made	his way up the marble stairs without once looking back.	5.826250313323382
9439. on the second	landing he paused to look for docherty didn't see him and accepted	a glass of champagne.	4.4312150329328075
9440. he took several large swallows recollected	that docherty had gone up another flight and decided he would be wise	to cover himself by finding him.	5.3008003580046275
9441. the way hoag was no telling what	he might say or do.	4.193385516451351
9442. he finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly	to the next landing.	6.610993620366797
9443. at the top a uniformed officer blocked further	progress.	6.372280480706034
9444. yes what is it?	10.409583009979668
9445.  he asked.	8.80323508231408
9446. he spotted docherty coming out of a room at the far	end of the corridor and called to him.	5.773962972460125
9447. docherty said it's	okay bonfiglio let him by.	4.913686410369733
9448. they walked toward each other.	8.451230752941052
9449. well?	10.144513917544229
9450.    griffith said hoag told me to tell you-	he waited until they were close; it was hideously embarrassing-	not to let the prime minister be alone with mahzeer.	4.880657602408853
9451. griffith	looked half-crocked to the captain; it would be just like him.	4.909459899223284
9452. why not?	15.017578564343802
9453.    he claims mahzeer's in a plot to kill	the pm.	4.645344995261077
9454. docherty went taut: was it possible?	7.163184125958424
9455. 	could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister	feared?	4.111125926734162
9456.  not possible he thought; the prime minister knew who	his enemy was here; he wasn't going to allow himself to be led meekly	to the slaughter.	5.083166140632964
9457. and if by some wild chance mahzeer was the man	he wouldn't dare try anything now- not after docherty had looked	in on the two of them to see that all was well.	3.998715916108005
9458. docherty was damned	if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over	the laundry truck.	5.082308479652492
9459. one more muddleheaded play like that one and they'd	be leading him away.	4.428595784347963
9460. still this had to be checked out.	9.47574825298042
9461. where'd	your friend hoag get his information?	5.219666477665999
9462.  he asked.	12.081077223713681
9463. would you mind	sending him up here?	6.585421343216098
9464.  i'd like to talk to him.	8.469816809794516
9465. troubled he continued	along the corridor poking his head into the next office for	a careful look around.	3.744109221929566
9466. but hoag had not stayed on the front	steps when griffith disappeared into the building.	5.799213733682533
9467. he was unwilling	to rely on griffith's carrying his message and he had no confidence	the police would act on it.	4.386728769736381
9468. if mahzeer was alone with the prime minister	he could be arranging his execution while hoag stood out here	shivering in the darkening street.	5.105478959952029
9469. he would have to do something on his	own.	8.388190475182553
9470. but what?	13.042504254880084
9471.    the door opened and three men and a woman	in a sari swept past him and down the stairs.	3.6994145604691075
9472. in the lighted interior	he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps.	6.645668342393419
9473. these were	the early departures; in half an hour the reception would be over.	4.600320235317811
9474. if	mahzeer was planning to set up the prime minister for muller he would	have to do it in the next few minutes.	6.562808121121197
9475. hoag descended the stone	steps to the street and looked up at the building.	4.382710942012187
9476. wide windows with	many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories.	5.739974350684024
9477. on the second	floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests; the scene looked	like a christmas card.	4.794282593403752
9478. on the third floor one of the two windows	was lighted; it was framed in maroon drapes and no faces were visible.	6.757313497508924
9479. this would be mahzeer's office.	7.709934164226031
9480. he and the prime minister would	be back from the window seated at mahzeer's desk; they would	be going over papers mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting.	5.075641984450995
9481. in a minute or five minutes the business would be done; mahzeer	would stand up the prime minister would follow.	3.9026278981622124
9482. mahzeer would direct	the prime minister's attention to something out the window and	would guide him forward and then step to one side.	4.807873378411027
9483. the single shot would	come; hoag would carry its sound to his grave.	3.862922728415019
9484. mahzeer of course	would be desolate.	7.712079578137997
9485. how was he to suspect that an assassin had been	lurking somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance?	4.272786777104585
9486. 	hoag turned.	11.155741451300253
9487. where across the street?	7.694358264547413
9488.  where was muller	waiting with the rifle?	8.95812236546172
9489.  narrow four-story buildings ran the length	of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf.	3.8491756159750072
9490. most of them could	be eliminated; muller's would have to be one of the half dozen	almost directly opposite.	8.952691161329508
9491. the legation was generously set back from	the building line; if the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings	on either side would interfere.	3.267611144632929
9492. would the shot come from a roof?	9.16817830458925
9493. 	he ran his eye along the roof copings; almost at once a figure	bulked up.	4.12919390519288
9494. but dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and	badge of a policeman.	5.616495470958554
9495. with a cop patrolling the road muller would	have to be inside a building- if he was here at all and not waiting	for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal	building at la guardia airport.	3.4707666646033246
9496. hoag crossed the narrow street	squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk.	6.112660490789796
9497. from this	side he could see farther into the legation's third-story window but	he saw no faces; the room's occupants were still seated or they	had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain.	3.4154379691611974
9498. if only	the latter were true h.	8.318297544304237
9499. he walked rapidly along the buildings scanning	their facades: one was a club- that was out; two others he	ruled out because all their windows were lighted.	3.5426171843067396
9500. that left three possibly	four one looking much like the next.	7.424991918742717
9501. he climbed the steps of	the first and opened the door to the vestibule.	4.312636641579914
9502. he quickly closed it	again.	8.978600574448244
9503. he had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into	apartments but this one from a glance at the hall furnishings was	obviously still a functioning town house and its owners were in residence;	that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans	had to be made in advance.	3.6149304873558057
9504. he went on to the next building and	found what he expected- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule.	6.652412111857043
9505. on one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes; there	were six apartments.	4.702149296200339
9506. now what?	14.167727714824611
9507.  the names on the mailboxes meant	nothing to him.	4.117397318910689
9508. this was senseless- he had no idea what to look for.	7.2590896521678205
9509. he peered in the boxes themselves; all were empty except one and	that one was jammed with letters and magazines.	3.6606271074526586
9510. the occupants of apartment	number 3 were probably away for a few days and not likely to	return on a friday.	5.448443162162891
9511. had muller made the same deduction?	6.509631332258464
9512.  muller	was attracted to the lore of mailboxes.	6.743273855772659
9513. he opened the inner door;	the cooking	odors were stronger- all over the city at this hour housewives	would be fussing over stoves.	4.038031196403157
9514. he climbed as quickly as he could urge	his body up the two unbroken flights to the third floor pulling	himself along on a delicate balustrade all that remained of the building's	beauty.	4.750934624100707
9515. he paused on the landing to steady his breathing and	then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb	overhead.	3.9386215912367644
9516. now he was certain: the lock had not yielded to muller's	collection of keys; fresh scars showed that the door had been	prized open.	5.274087302102147
9517. it had been shut again but the lock was broken; he noted	with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch.	4.2269520907774085
9518. what was he to do now?	9.652827751811808
9519.  he had thought no further than finding muller.	5.570660943487726
9520. he realized now he had more than half hoped he wouldn't find	him- that muller would not be here that the attempt would be scheduled	for somewhere beyond hoag's control.	5.5251707545308735
9521. he could not break in on	an armed man.	6.00520417802839
9522. he would have to climb back down to the street and signal	a cop.	8.488315593884906
9523. was there time?	8.537512884717716
9524.    his thoughts were scattered by	the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door.	6.7012238732077805
9525. hoag pushed	open the door: at the far end of the long dark room muller was	faintly silhouetted against the window the rifle still raised; he stood	with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill.	3.5339808389321923
9526. he turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back	to the window and his rifle sight dismissing hoag for the moment	with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at hoag's apartment.	4.721500667951176
9527. hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled	for the switch: evil flourishes in the dark.	4.089641268983058
9528. the room was bathed in	light at the instant muller's second shot came.	5.2464989695561925
9529. muller nakedly	exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car's headlights	threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table; his face	wore a look of outrage.	3.2653762695140407
9530. a shot caught him and straightened him up in	screaming pain; a following volley of shots shattered glass ripped	the	ceiling and sent him lurching heavily from the table.	4.635865727751762
9531. he was dead	before his body made contact with the floor.	5.496080030086497
9532. hoag stumbled back into	the hall leaned against the wall and started to retch.	5.559081193659044
9533. after	captain docherty sent arleigh griffith for hoag he was able to	complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a	report from his man covering the floors above before griffith returned	buoyed up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne.	3.482888259160574
9534. the safe at ingleside district station stands next to the gum	machine in a narrow passageway that leads to captain harris's office	the lieutenant's office	and the janitor's supply closet.	4.677887423344093
9535. the	safe is a repository for three dead flashlight batteries a hundred	and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint cards a stack of unsold policemen's	ball tickets from last year and thirty-seven cents in coins	and stamps.	3.3622631864514565
9536. gun set the captain's fifth of hiram walker inside	the safe before he reported to lt killpath though he knew that	killpath's ulcer prevented him from making any untoward incursion on	herman wolff's gift.	4.456269831088081
9537. it was more a matter of tact and also it	was none of killpath's goddam business.	4.788150113931148
9538. he walked up to the	lieutenant's office leaned wearily against the gun rack that housed	four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a submachine	gun that was occasionally tried out on the academy range.	4.710717653733243
9539. he stared	at the clerk who sat at a scarred and ancient fumed-oak desk stuffing	envelopes.	3.9894859797279003
9540. where's the lieut?	9.52328749892442
9541.    the clerk	wagged his head toward the captain's office.	4.1174608023645085
9542. gun went to the connecting	door which was open and stood at attention while orville torrence	killpath in full uniform finished combing his hair.	5.135809406739801
9543. the lieutenant's sparse brown hair was heavily pomaded and as killpath	raked the comb through it it stuck together in thatches so that	it looked like umbrella ribs clinging to his pink skull.	3.1094247477676515
9544. the lieutenant	eyed gun's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and then	glanced back at his own face moving the comb methodically around his	head.	4.456516269869767
9545. leave me alone gun thought.	5.722905047556491
9546. fight with sam schaeffer	fight with the whole damned bureau.	6.645422231828384
9547. because	i'm looking for the son of a bitch that killed that old man and i'm	going to get him.	4.208637801838994
9548. if you just leave me to hell alone lieutenant.	7.4323092698553275
9549. killpath peered through half-closed lids at his reflection	thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and about-faced.	3.6656380588104636
9550. gun waited for killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window.	5.448482501884564
9551. he sat stiff-backed in a chair that did not swivel though it was	obvious to gun that killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly	merited a swivel chair.	3.5613587004964304
9552. the desk before him was in no better repair	than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room including wooden	file cabinets with some of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe	stained with the roof seepage of countless seasons.	4.725906225960872
9553. killpath	pulled one thin leg up clamping his arms around the shinbone to press	his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut.	3.5853166747464886
9554. it was the posture which the	men had come to recognize as that of killpath defying his ulcer.	6.524934409201634
9555. he	put his chin on his kneecap stretching his neck like that of a turkey	on a chopping block and stared wordlessly at his sergeant.	3.833656146125999
9556. the 7:45 bell rang and he could hear the outside	doors bang shut closing in the assembled day watch.	4.95968634106639
9557. finally	orville intoned through his hawk nose we can't have people running	in any time they please sergeant.	3.781066042194866
9558. can't have it.	9.52328749892442
9559. makes for confusion and	congestion.	6.969075695628714
9560. he rocked back in the chair knee locked against stomach	his beady eyes fixed on matson.	5.800573162818538
9561. he was silent again possibly	listening to the sounds in the squadroom.	4.697195195635426
9562. gun cleared his throat.	8.457718703298294
9563. killpath said you were expected	to report to	my office twenty minutes ago sergeant.	4.0683852436856025
9564. that's not getting	all the juice out of the orange now is it?	6.600336241954987
9565.    no sir.	10.226892168747714
9566. gun knew that nothing but aces back	to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at the same time.	5.471868564762441
9567. the day-watch platoon commander lt rinker was calling	out the beat assignments but matson couldn't make the names mean	anything.	3.390604280653994
9568. i called the station at three this morning	killpath's nasal voice pronounced.	6.156832949080374
9569. do you have any idea who might	have been in charge at the time?	5.06079143744927
9570.    sergeant vaughn	sir.	11.406798369392266
9571. now now you're just guessing sergeant.	6.02453886563994
9572. he	smiled thinly savoring his joke.	7.712079578137997
9573. what if i said nobody was here	but a couple of patrolmen?	5.673344644376162
9574.    sir vaughn knows better	than to leave the station without a relief.	7.090882368868468
9575. he must have-	he let a patrolman take over the duties of the station keeper.	4.916628189157201
9576. now	that's not regulation is it?	7.712079578137997
9577.    no sir.	10.226892168747714
9578. but you didn't know a thing about it did you?	6.76278077176212
9579.  killpath leaned	forward; his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again	frowning now.	3.8977255232075314
9580. that's not taking one's command with a responsible	attitude matson.	6.144814417540349
9581. gun told himself that the old bastard	was a fool.	4.658572485967929
9582. but stupidity was no consolation when it had rank.	6.888397038684097
9583. i was out in the district sir.	8.056976331102765
9584. he stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers	on his desk.	6.509811867417367
9585. i might point out that your inability to report to	my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not h ah	h limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped.	3.8469871733437686
9586. he took up a white sheet of paper dark with single-spaced data.	6.298160145819298
9587. a car pulled into the driveway outside the window.	4.428883386136861
9588. gun knew it	was car 12 the wagon returned from delivering ingleside's	drunk-and-disorderlies	to the city jail.	5.331440467598945
9589. but for some fool reason he couldn't	remember which men he'd put on the transfer detail.	4.328429973934249
9590. he stared	at the report in killpath's hand sure it was written by accacia-	just as sure as if he'd submitted it in his scrawled longhand.	4.997818692586155
9591. he	sucked in his breath and kept quiet while killpath laid down the sheet	again wound the gold-wire stems of his glasses around his ears and	then eying the report as it lay before him on the desk intoned acting	lieutenant gunnar matson one failed to see that the station	keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire	watch without checking on the station's activities or the whereabouts	of his section sergeants three permitted members of the homicide	detail of the inspector's bureau to arrogate for their own convenience	a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper	assignment four failed to notify the station commander acting captain	o t killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five	frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours spots for	purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six-	he leaned back and peeled off his glasses - failed to co-operate	with the acting captain by returning promptly when so ordered.	2.9554645354552216
9592. what	have you to say to that sergeant?	7.069871430797626
9593.  killpath sailed the paper	across the desk but matson didn't pick it up or even glance at it.	3.685338251241182
9594. well?	13.921774766768346
9595.    i didn't think accacia knew so	many big words lieutenant.	4.85486375821358
9596. patrolman	accacia is an alert and conscientious law-enforcement officer.	6.508933396269939
9597. i don't think his diligence mitigates your negligence matson.	4.97251910011989
9598. negligence hell! gun held his breath a moment	pushing	the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his	throat.	4.861416487662795
9599. i would have been negligent and a goddam lousy cop to	boot if i'd sat around this station all night when somebody got	away with murder in my district.	3.9582979548185486
9600. it's too bad i didn't call you	and it's too bad i let schaeffer use accacia when he could have	had a boy who'd be glad to learn something of homicide procedure.	4.553834491663274
9601. but i'm not one damned bit sorry i went out to question the people	i know in the places they hang around and-   let's	not push our patience beyond the danger line sergeant killpath	nasaled.	3.3696512008591184
9602. i shouldn't like to have to write you up for insubordination	as well as dereliction of duty.	5.8977289291243915
9603. gun stiffened his hands	balling into fists at his sides.	4.477601198394805
9604. he clamped his jaws to keep the	fury from spilling out.	6.130331029301074
9605. an argument with orville torrence killpath	was as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing range.	3.7851382737589376
9606. killpath leaned forward again rocked comfortably with his arms	still wrapped around one knee.	5.448482501884564
9607. let's just remember sergeant	that we must all carry our own umbrella.	4.182602481535312
9608. a district station can't	run smoothly unless- he interrupted himself looking around gun	at the doorway.	5.290676638931941
9609. i thought you hadn't come in yet.	5.644662125023615
9610. i've	been here for some time.	7.712079578137997
9611. he stood up cocked his head and eyed gun	coldly.	4.814619654067704
9612. the sergeant is just leaving.	6.5155523300336915
9613. it had come as	no great surprise to matson that the hot water in the showers didn't	work that loren severe had thrown up all over the stairs or that	some thieving bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes.	3.561426907602084
9614. it	was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session	in killpath's office.	5.271554264391871
9615. now as he passed the open counter	that divided the assembly room from the business office he nodded	and said good night to the station keeper and his clerks not stopping	to hear the day-watch playback of his chewing out.	3.4110923820350454
9616. not that he	gave a damn what the grapevine sent out about killpath's little speech	on the comportment of platoon commanders.	5.529834413150396
9617. he just didn't want	to talk about it.	5.526254852121589
9618. if the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant	to sit on his ass around the station all night killpath would just	have to go out and drag gun back by the heels once an hour; because	he'd be damned if he was going to be a mid-watch pencil-pusher just	to please his ulcerated pro-tem captain.	5.1133754048883935
9619. at the doorway he squinted	up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for	the cigarettes remembering then that he'd left them at the doughnuttery.	3.7649610205982293
9620. he could pick up another pack on his way home if he were going	home.	6.793648836084922
9621. but even before he started across the oiled road to his plymouth	parked in the lot under the cypress trees across from the station	he knew that he wasn't going home.	3.8093974348788238
9622. it	was nine o'clock in the morning: the hour which like a spade turning	clods of earth exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that	had lain dormant in the quiet night.	4.724814403071158
9623. mission street at this hour was	populated by a whole community that gun could not have seen on his	tour of duty- the neighborhood that had known urbano quintana by	day.	3.4638798712850356
9624. sol phillips had purchased the alliance furniture	mart seventeen years ago.	5.9245075971793435
9625. it was professedly worth three thousand dollars	in stock and good will and the name was written in gold in foot-high	letters across each of the two display windows.	4.13997380958175
9626. on the right	window at eye level in smaller print but also in gold was gonzalez	prop and under that se habla espanol.	5.4190189170321705
9627. mr phillips	took a razor to gonzalez prop but left the promise	that spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that spanish	clientele would be welcome.	3.6903126385786016
9628. language was no problem anyway;	mr phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from	the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of mission	street.	4.652472387382003
9629. aside from the fact that business was slow this	time	of year and his one salesgirl was not the most enterprising mr	phillips had no worries at all and he said as much to gun matson	who sat across from him in civilian clothes on a jiffy-couch-a-bed	mauve velour $79.	3.798632954765234
9630. 89 nothing-down special!   she's honest	as the day mr phillips said and added mr gunnar	i can say this to you: beebe is a little too honest.	5.0956102544681325
9631. you can't	tell a customer how much it's going to cost him to refinance his payments	before he even signs for a loan on the money down! a time plan	is a mere convenience you understand and when- he interrupted	himself smiling.	3.3927213074560094
9632. i put her in lamps.	9.559994536280366
9633. that way i don't lose	so much.	6.694401563869587
9634. why don't you just hire somebody else?	7.930303022545094
9635. 	she says she has to finish a story.	5.230561486546241
9636. i	asked her why she couldn't do it tomorrow but it seems the muse is	working good tonight and she's afraid to let it go.	5.071236926191518
9637. casey	made some comment but his mind was busy as he considered the man.	4.085426079314025
9638. his	name was george needham and he too had come from a good family.	6.364680443174652
9639. he was perhaps thirty-two nicely set up with light brown hair that	had a pronounced wave.	4.175509198230876
9640. he was always well groomed and well tailored	and he had that rich man's look which was authentic enough and came	from two good prep schools and a proper university.	4.937255102010435
9641. an only child he	had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money	and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke.	3.75453595469201
9642. since then he had worked at this and that though some said his main	interest was gambling.	5.845869222561886
9643. all this went through casey's mind	in the first instant but what held his interest was the fact that	these two should be together at all.	3.726860668045065
9644. for he had understood that betty	had been engaged to a boy named barry jenkins.	6.141959977215318
9645. she had grown up with	young jenkins and he had heard that they had been at the point of	getting married at least twice.	5.043728659258159
9646. he wanted to ask her about jenkins	now but he knew he couldn't do so in needham's presence.	6.112692475764627
9647. and so	still wondering and a little perplexed he grinned at the girl and	spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding.	3.774395397703201
9648. where did you pick him up?	8.55484484177077
9649.    oh i've known him quite	a while.	5.930747801191029
9650. she glanced at her companion fondly.	8.037204458577536
9651. haven't i	george?	8.12896173865557
9652.    i've been after her for years needham	said but i've never been able to get anywhere until the last	few days.	5.820716945195142
9653. the girl's eyes were softly shining as she reached	out and touched casey's hand.	3.6311862882065773
9654. can i tell you a secret?	8.573248280288007
9655. 	we're going to get married.	5.984636472844131
9656. do you approve?	13.497662839409136
9657.    casey kept	his smile fixed but some small inner disturbance was working on him	as	he thought again about needham who was eight or ten years older than	the girl.	3.452119323198926
9658. he wondered whether needham was going to swear off gambling	and get a steady job or whether he was counting on the income from	betty's estate to subsidize him.	4.953068579654908
9659. none of this showed in his face	and he tried to keep his skepticism in hand.	4.795482468691586
9660. he made a point of frowning	of acting out the part of the fond father-confessor.	7.810381391236316
9661. i'll	have to give it some thought he said.	5.327937802852132
9662. you wouldn't want	me to say yes without making sure his intentions are honorable would	you?	6.072819816372639
9663.    she made a face at him and then she laughed.	4.687080376675738
9664. i'll get my references in order needham	said and though he spoke with a smile casey somehow got the idea	that he was not particularly amused.	5.05744449296378
9665. stop by any time casey.	5.619635421798327
9666. he stood up and touched the girl's arm.	6.976850310828101
9667. if	you're really serious about working on that story i'd better take	you home.	4.0683852436856025
9668. casey watched them go still frowning absently	and then dismissing the matter as he called for his check.	5.1905898144046425
9669. as he went	out he told freddie the dinner was perfect and when he got his hat	and coat from nancy parks and put a fifty-piece piece in the slot	he told her to be sure that it went toward her dowry.	3.723109330345886
9670. a taxi	took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car and a few	minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment.	5.172252530919122
9671. because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple	of hours he did not think to look and see if jerry burton's	car was still there.	4.14912076487079
9672. in fact he did not think about jerry burton at	all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him.	5.982171224538108
9673. only then when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was	empty did he remember his earlier problem.	3.864787253811856
9674. even from where he	stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over	burton the pillow the sheet of paper on top of it.	5.882972984457623
9675. then he was striding	across the room his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly	inside him as he snatched up the note.	3.9344430885903257
9676. jack:	look in	the wastebasket.	9.52328749892442
9677. i knew the only way i could beat you was to play possum	but it was a good try kid and i appreciate it.	4.672384051503393
9678. j	the wastebasket stood near the wall next to the divan and the instant	casey picked it up he knew what had happened.	5.165366855801388
9679. the discarded papers	inside were sodden there was a glint of liquid at the bottom and	the smell of whisky was strong and distinct.	3.802121129567397
9680. he put the basket down	distastefully muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself	and his plan that had seemed so foolproof.	5.264200447893985
9681. for he remembered too well	how he had brought back the loaded drinks to burton and then returned	to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself.	3.722747518695686
9682. for another	second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself;	then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more	serious and as the thought expanded the implications jarred him.	4.798764667009697
9683. it	no longer mattered that burton had outsmarted him.	4.6724501027054846
9684. the important thing	was that burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun	in his pocket.	5.065781445633716
9685. and that gun was empty.	7.328850519132819
9686. even before his mind	had rounded out the idea he thrust one hand into his trousers pocket	and pulled out the six slugs he had taken from the revolver.	5.19332076055625
9687. he considered	them with brooding eyes brows bunched as his brain grappled with	the problem and tried to find some solution.	3.9937149706195685
9688. he said: the crazy	fool half aloud.	7.5139871259533155
9689. he put the shells on the table as though he	could no longer bear to hold them.	4.262253162015704
9690. he thought: where the hell	could he have gone?	6.672854314451728
9691.  how can i find him?	7.4535183165124055
9692.    there was no answer	to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room his	imagination out of control.	6.482496015785402
9693. he tried to tell himself that maybe burton	had sobered up enough to get some sense.	4.520733668555371
9694. maybe he only intended to	scare the blackmailer whoever he was in which case an unloaded gun	would be good enough.	5.818400373122181
9695. he thought of other possibilities none of them	satisfactory and finally he began to think to wonder if there was	some way he could reach burton.	3.8430867728489364
9696. then as he turned toward the telephone	it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached	for it eagerly.	5.3190452108958794
9697. tony calenda.	8.12896173865557
9698. casey heard	the voice distinctly and he knew who it was but it took him a while to	make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his	head.	4.847034429946842
9699. when he heard calenda say: what about that picture you took	this afternoon?	4.8162923148856125
9700.  it still took him another few seconds to remember	the job he had done for frank ackerly.	5.667774620295926
9701. you took a picture of me at the corner of	washington and blake about three thirty this afternoon.	4.399652949856349
9702. who says so?	12.263020488744052
9703.    one of my boys.	10.236107697028071
9704. calenda was not the sort who walked around without one	of his boys close at hand.	5.839862192931404
9705. so?	10.144513917544229
9706.    with	my trial coming up in federal court next week i wouldn't want that	picture published.	5.331440467598945
9707. who says it's going to be published?	7.399285737319743
9708. 	i wouldn't even want it to get around.	6.412214371980113
9709. under normal circumstances casey was a little fussy when people told	him what to do with pictures he had taken.	4.626665858597278
9710. even so he generally listened	and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections	properly.	7.067702584042502
9711. right now however he was still too worried about jerry	burton and the gun that had no bullets and the story burton had told	him to care too much about tony calenda.	3.4223831652281906
9712. his nerves were getting	a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice.	5.372099434160921
9713. i was hired to take a picture.	6.909689827680934
9714. that's all i know about it and that's all i care.	5.739974350684024
9715. maybe	you'd better tell the guy who hired you what i said.	4.281959405668466
9716. all right calenda said his voice	still quiet.	7.644912651241943
9717. but i meant what i said casey.	6.176081575021015
9718. if that picture	gets around and i find out you had anything to do with it i'm	going to send a couple of my boys around to see you.	5.623025907939066
9719. you	do that casey said.	6.162967476035402
9720. just be sure to send your two best boys	tony.	7.608650712088202
9721. he hung up with a bang annoyed at himself for running	off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation	he had helped to create.	3.77778148976789
9722. as soon as he could think logically	again he reached for the telephone directory and found jerry burton's	home number.	6.080695166485268
9723. he dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before	he hung up.	4.083443138568456
9724. he called the bar and grill where he had picked burton	up that afternoon.	6.712003561323944
9725. when he was told that no one had seen burton since	then he thought of three other places that were possibilities.	5.03377993650625
9726. each	time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up.	7.307828621114863
9727. by	the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down.	4.182602481535312
9728. he had done	all he could and that was that.	7.877081306873659
9729. and anyway burton was not the kind	of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk.	4.43502992747117
9730. he casey had been scared for a while but that had come mostly from	the fact that he felt responsible.	5.808787512304225
9731. he should have stayed here and	watched burton.	5.35200934863094
9732. so he made a mistake.	11.88212414789801
9733. so what?	10.389658501279966
9734. 	he kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make	a drink.	6.355486775331636
9735. only then did he decide he didn't want one.	5.2589169991579565
9736. he considered	opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too.	6.25457471757553
9737. finally he went into	the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes.	4.605761618355551
9738. he had just finished	unlacing the right one when the telephone rang again.	6.735855100215925
9739. when he snatched	it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent.	4.618299068322053
9740. casey?	13.921774766768346
9741. 	you don't know me but i know you.	4.904679009831514
9742. if you want a picture	get to the corner of adams and clark just as fast as you can.	6.251148732033002
9743. if you	hurry you might beat the headquarters boys.	5.292387306985838
9744. casey heard the	click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth and it	took him no more than three seconds to make his decision.	5.50155966929661
9745. for over	the years he had received many such calls.	5.196923845458908
9746. some of them came from people	who identified themselves.	9.194043886237433
9747. some telephoned because he had done	them a favor in the past.	4.85039039721824
9748. others because they expected some sort of	reward for the information.	6.661974786262218
9749. a few passed along a tip for the simple	reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break.	4.075622000418273
9750. only	an occasional tip turned out to be a phony and like the police casey	had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not	hesitate this time.	5.431236138142543
9751. he was in his car with his camera and equipment	bag in less than two minutes and it took him only three more	to reach the corner a block from columbus avenue.	3.9784445679955116
9752. it was a district	of small factories and loft buildings and occasional tenements and	he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed	on the brakes.	5.147760661423681
9753. he did not bother with his radio- there would be time	for that later- but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the	filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how	he had been summoned.	3.9213348982960667
9754. the police car had pulled up behind a	small sedan its headlights still on.	5.124247946430673
9755. slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving	at	little more than a crawl and watched elaine rapidly spin from one	station to another tune in the null then draw in a line on the chart.	3.376935707789053
9756. we're out just a little too far.	7.562964986140374
9757. make a 90 degree straight	for shore.	6.465782524716275
9758. poet came in raising his eyebrows appreciatively	as he saw elaine.	5.9245075971793435
9759. pretty quick	she replied.	7.076285890420987
9760. will you drop the anchor?	9.60708723044091
9761.    poet nodded	swung below and a moment later emerged from the forward hatch where	he picked up the anchor.	3.9432215217894098
9762. the rock and roll music coming from the radio	station suddenly faded as the boat coasted into the null on the rdf.	4.734905401005638
9763. reverse elaine said then peered through the loop	of the rdf and waved to poet.	3.8849121559715263
9764. a second later she came behind	the wheel and backed off the anchor line until it was set in the ocean	floor.	5.394140385074096
9765. she cut the engines and slowly the cruiser swung around on	the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the	cockpit faced toward the shore.	3.452293061773934
9766. nick watched her somewhat enviously as	she efficiently cut the engines and started the auxiliary motor.	5.368890961686705
9767. poet came up from below wearing new bathing trunks.	4.477601198394805
9768. the price	tag hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the chartroom	and looked at it curiously.	4.939799793475924
9769. nick wondered if elaine had bought them	but he said nothing.	4.317068102383446
9770. nobody he suddenly realized was saying anything.	7.670263780181435
9771. it seemed as if they were all under a spell.	6.725168276107223
9772. there should be an	excited conversation for somewhere directly below them was a treasure	lost for more than four hundred years.	6.437876059737351
9773. but instead of chatter	there was a null like on the radio direction finder.	4.213008568081368
9774. once in new	york he had gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane	with a single engine.	5.738188779192387
9775. they had all been laughing joking when	suddenly the engine had failed.	5.026531379951152
9776. no one had prayed.	12.188460011729132
9777. all had fallen into a complete silence listening to the wind whistle	over the wings.	4.196669529573979
9778. the pilot had been good.	6.769904883665157
9779. he'd landed the plane	on a small airstrip in connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had	coasted to a stop everyone had burst into chatter at the same moment.	3.9894049295640888
9780. there had been tension in the plane during the silent descent;	a tension similar to the one now.	6.38957924862537
9781. but in the plane there was a concrete	reason for it.	6.463682912245095
9782. now at this moment there should be none h unless	skin diving was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe.	6.322907775423339
9783. the same taut-nerved relationship as there	had been between the passengers on the plane now strained at the three	of them here on the boat.	3.6678189230284826
9784. it hung over them like a cloud its arrival	as sudden as a cloud skidding over the sun.	5.454212145242807
9785. silently elaine	picked up her keys from the table and went out into the cockpit poet	behind her nick trailing behind him.	3.9611460882289693
9786. she threw back a cushion over	one of the seats unlocked a padlock on the chest beneath it then	presently straightened holding a long knife and a wicked looking spear	gun in her hand.	4.716171446567889
9787. poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun.	4.681003388460025
9788. they are the	best.	12.383433901020247
9789. she kicked the locker lid shut and replaced the cushion.	4.687080376675738
9790. they are the most efficient.	12.724636489676096
9791. and the deadliest poet	commented as he buckled on his tank harness.	4.824951072429955
9792. why do you	need an arsenal?	9.390255018127325
9793.  nick asked apprehensively staring at the weapon.	4.913686410369733
9794. it's quite possible there's more than codfish down	there man poet replied with a short nervous laugh as he held	the harness for elaine.	4.859639113861314
9795. a moment later moving awkwardly because	of the swimming fins she picked up the gun handed the knife to poet	then rolled off the transom of the boat back first.	3.4860302180733154
9796. poet nodded	to nick and entered the water in a similar fashion.	6.220372646736063
9797. another moment	and they were out of sight leaving behind only a string of bubbles as	a clue to their whereabouts.	4.036769598001127
9798. for a while nick followed the	twisting course of the bubbles wondering which set came from elaine.	6.8042823029430854
9799. they remained close together their air trail wiggling like serpents	traveling side by side.	4.167307048760176
9800. eventually the bubbles became lost in the sparkle	of the ocean surface and he rolled over on his back.	5.526979307909667
9801. clasping	his hands behind his head he stared at the blue sky.	4.182602481535312
9802. there was	nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean.	6.693985901777056
9803. alfredo certainly	must have enjoyed being alone.	5.219666477665999
9804. next to the ocean probably the	loneliest spot was the desert.	7.77304642941218
9805. if elaine's uncle had stuck to this	desire for aloneness he probably would still be alive.	4.352967505172598
9806. yet alfredo	wanted money h wanted money to roam through the deserts.	6.293167149956358
9807. and	graham wanted money probably to roam among the dice tables in las	vegas.	4.0683852436856025
9808. it was an odd combination h a strange pair to stumble upon	the wreck of the trinidad.	5.85920873346026
9809. but graham hadn't stumbled on it.	5.7327140783480806
9810. two to three weeks prior to the charter of the virginia graham	had been snooping around the san luis rey mission.	5.757541754668662
9811. the small	helicopter with its two steel skids churned offshore and nick raised	up to watch it heading south.	3.428445430010395
9812. that was a hell of a note he thought.	8.266476574977503
9813. a couple couldn't even find a secluded spot anywhere on a beach	to neck nowadays without someone swooping down upon them.	3.7098161978662993
9814. if the character	flying that thing had gone over san clemente island yesterday	he would have had an eyeful.	5.837735646886843
9815. off to the west a beautiful schooner	slowly beat its way into the wind headed on a tack toward san	clemente.	4.638916007970168
9816. behind it a cabin cruiser drifted crossways in the small	ground-swell a lone fisherman in the chair aft.	5.223600049754043
9817. the fisherman was right	in the middle of the deep.	4.83248119733575
9818. nick recalled stories that the two best	fishing spots in southern california were over the la jolla deep	and the redondo deep two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic	depths almost from the shoreline.	4.5873394599627355
9819. someday geologists	had warned the land on both sides of these deeps would fall into the	ocean and no more la jolla or redondo beach.	3.823847559717256
9820. meanwhile fishermen	took advantage of them to pull up whoppers.	7.668048580988994
9821. sometimes the fish exploded	as they neared the surface because of the difference in pressure.	5.3577140388898865
9822. why he wondered had elaine wanted him along on this trip?	6.445034267196369
9823. 	he couldn't skindive he couldn't run a boat except on the open	sea.	4.0683852436856025
9824. he stood up stretched looked around for the bubbles but could	see none.	5.752170478420188
9825. strolling down to the galley he lit the butane under the	coffee pot and when the brew was heated poured himself a cup and went	up to the chartroom.	3.743455858193869
9826. turning on the hi-fi he went back to the cockpit	stretched out on the cushions and listened to the music.	6.45485806181761
9827. elaine	and poet returned together popping up over the transom almost	like dolphins breaking water.	3.9701983041559052
9828. he sat up and watched as they pulled	themselves over the stern.	5.985764271525552
9829. poet	shook his head sliding his face mask up on his forehead.	4.182602481535312
9830. we're right on the edge of the deep elaine said.	7.859493898509082
9831. pulling	off her face mask she carefully placed the spear gun across the stern	then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water.	3.377283645704905
9832. which	is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile	she added as she swung her legs over the transom.	4.9606929819382515
9833. any news?	10.354488745756813
9834. 	not a thing.	9.52328749892442
9835. he tossed her a towel then repeated the	service for poet.	4.467047448170571
9836. cigarette?	13.921774766768346
9837.    elaine shook her head	as she slipped out of her harness but poet nodded.	4.107266025044416
9838. his feet still hung	over the stern of the transom but as he reached for the smoke he	raised them to swing them in.	5.071727792983938
9839. the fin on his foot caught on the moulding	throwing him off balance.	3.700289227276755
9840. his forearm smashed painfully into the	narrow washboard and he grimaced as he grabbed his bruised limb with	his other hand and rolled into the boat.	4.75937403817828
9841. kee-reist! the	word hissed distinctly from poet's lips as he struggled to his feet.	3.9701983041559052
9842. turning slowly he saw poet	in a brilliant glare of horror.	6.348618445057734
9843. poet! his face was still creased in	pain as he studied the underside of his arm.	4.012126891243388
9844. poet a murderer?	9.52328749892442
9845.  turning	quickly toward elaine nick saw that she too stood in shocked	surprise.	4.182602481535312
9846. the sudden silence was too silent.	6.154713990487742
9847. instinctively	aware of the charged atmosphere poet raised his head slowly looking	first at elaine.	3.9701983041559052
9848. she had caught the implication of the oath.	8.198907568396864
9849. her face was frozen into the mask of a mannequin her body absolutely	motionless.	4.304706645661433
9850. and then nick knew that all of them knew h elaine	himself h and poet.	7.193271227360031
9851. elaine recovered first so quickly	that nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction.	4.413635899887848
9852. do	you need a bandage?	9.090276269144642
9853.  she asked steadily.	8.926231624174129
9854. it's like banging a shin he said his eyes lingered	on nick's face then moved back to elaine.	5.057556181613073
9855. hurts like hell for	a second then it disappears.	4.6724501027054846
9856. elaine turned and started toward the companionway.	7.106434804186405
9857. but her walk	was too steady too slow telegraphing her fear.	4.865341014275208
9858. so did poet.	12.472905795890776
9859. springing like a cat he leaped back swooped up the	spring gun and whirling pointed it toward the cabin.	3.632711015013689
9860. at the same	instant nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man.	5.961460278760537
9861. the gun fired next to his ear with a vicious whoosh like the first stroke	of an old steam engine.	3.3563915519848933
9862. at the same instant elaine screamed wildly	the sound ending abruptly as nick went off the boat and into the	water on top of the frantic struggling poet.	5.723523347829841
9863. the moment the	sea closed over nick some atavistic sense warned him that he would	survive in this alien element only if he did not panic.	3.7911410784873203
9864. but the murderer	to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage.	6.860691731236554
9865. the wide flippers	on poet's feet gave his legs incredible power driving the two of them	down into the water as they rolled over and over.	3.2826511786754082
9866. poet was the captured	arms pinioned to his side and he twisted convulsively trying	to escape.	5.331440467598945
9867. poet would escape nick thought grimly because he wore the	apparatus which would keep him alive under water.	3.685338251241182
9868. but nick would	not let go.	8.558806346535226
9869. the rubber and glass face mask slipped from poet's	forehead bounced painlessly off nick's chin then disappeared.	3.470558666016351
9870. poet twisted again and nick's knuckles scraped on the air tank ripping	off the skin.	5.540748693991729
9871. for a split second nick relaxed his grip and poet's	slippery body spun completely around before nick could stop	him holding him now from the rear.	3.7831589865749433
9872. something flailed at the side of	nick's head as they rolled around and around.	5.834853992989179
9873. suddenly poet	stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water	not rising not sinking.	4.48958036832042
9874. a sharp pain lanced across nick's chest and	a bubble of air escaped from his tortured lungs joining dozens of	others that sailed lazily toward the surface like helium balloons rising	into the sky.	4.489924289010448
9875. a black snake-like object swayed eerily in front of	him spewing bubbles from its flat cobra head.	3.7180561565000416
9876. the air hose was free!	the discovery struck nick like a blow.	5.6101932425645735
9877. desperately nick	flashed one hand up catching poet's neck in the bend of his elbow.	3.8849121559715263
9878. at the same instant he grabbed the loose writhing hose with his	other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece.	6.0233262689385985
9879. instinctively	he exhaled through his nose then sucked in the air from the hose.	4.461225819289498
9880. at	once the excruciating pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with	a sudden wild exultation.	5.674783068690981
9881. as if this was a signal poet abruptly	began to thrash the water and the quick movement slowly made them	sink through the water.	4.526203833327777
9882. relentlessly nick held on sucking on the	hose inhaling the air that belonged to poet.	5.331440467598945
9883. poet was not fighting	nick now.	5.619635421798327
9884. harbor point sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck	of a steamer clam.	5.879103271181348
9885. it's a rich village but not much for action- too	many solid residents not enough tourists or working stiffs.	3.7651534845375205
9886. it's	at the far end of the county and the last time i came here was for	a hit and run manslaughter- about seven months ago.	5.508460820109436
9887. chief bob	moore looked his same hick-self; a man mountain running to lard	in his middle-age.	4.09302370507176
9888. seeing me he said with real surprise well well	ain't we honored! hardly expected the head of county homicide	up for this murder.	5.209418175638449
9889. you sure climbed fast jed.	7.1579971233068465
9890. rookie investigator	last summer and now it's inspector jed.	6.762356494299977
9891. took me 19 years	to become chief of our three man police force.	4.0683852436856025
9892. proves a college	education pays off.	7.712079578137997
9893. his sarcasm was followed by a stupid grin of his	thick mouth and bad teeth.	4.527429790378192
9894. i guess it helps i said	paying no attention to his ribbing.	6.156832949080374
9895. never could figure out	why you ever wanted to be a cop jed.	5.443391706176767
9896. you're not only young but h	well you don't even look like a police officer.	5.490180309490924
9897. a runt with	narrow shoulders and that brush haircut h hell you'd pass for a	juvenile delinquent of the hotrod set.	3.5638450701706486
9898. in my day the first requirement	for a cop was to look like the law big and tough.	6.11820672019333
9899. man when my 275	pounds and six-four comes along why it's the same as another badge.	4.747153028527978
9900. when i say move a guy moves!   don't worry about	my being tough moore.	6.368867406020135
9901. also it's far too early in the day for corny	lines like the bigger they come h you've had your gassy lecture	let's get to work.	4.007730799836841
9902. who was the murdered woman h mrs buck?	7.772045025529306
9903. 	widow nice sort of woman.	5.619635421798327
9904. came to the harbor as a bride and h don't worry	jed this one is in the bag.	6.257554630071548
9905. i know the killer have the only road	off the peninsula covered.	5.048022685614343
9906. yeah passed your road block	as i drove in i said sitting on his polished desk.	5.3699119281787056
9907. although	bob dressed like a slob he kept a neat office.	4.3804364992288365
9908. okay what happened?	9.52328749892442
9909. 	about nine this morning mrs buck phones me she's	having trouble with one of her farm hands- money trouble.	4.219967794114781
9910. colored	fellow named tim williams- only hand she has working for her	now.	5.739974350684024
9911. tim come with the migratory workers that follow the crops up from	the south last year but tim and his wife settled here.	3.9683690949470383
9912. never had	no trouble with him before thought he was a hard worker hustling around	to get a full week's work.	5.958514442422201
9913. anyway julia asks me to h.	5.315705084550589
9914. julia?	13.921774766768346
9915.    come on inspector look alive.	5.741277205974362
9916. julia buck the deceased moore said slipping me his smug idiot-grin	again.	5.739974350684024
9917. julia asks me to come out at once.	4.875542932245959
9918. but she didn't	sound real alarmed h you know like there was any immediate danger.	5.90946862843024
9919. i got there at 9:47 am found her strangled.	4.853033070445193
9920. i would have	come sooner if i'd known h.	7.902942202172635
9921. no doubt about tim being the killer-	i have a witness.	5.451184451243634
9922. don't know why the county had to send anybody	up here.	5.9245075971793435
9923. told them i can handle this.	5.513180081333089
9924. yeah seems	you have a nice package with all the strings tied.	6.318905138091801
9925. who's h?	8.12896173865557
9926. 	i'll collar tim before night.	7.712079578137997
9927. who's your	witness?	8.12896173865557
9928.    julia had- has- an old indian woman cooking	for her- nellie harris.	5.739974350684024
9929. probably the last of the original island	indians.	7.162091240273027
9930. nellie was in the kitchen had just come to work when	she heard tim arguing with julia in the living room.	5.884795616815558
9931. swears she	recognized his voice that tim yelled 'it's my money and i want	it'! and then rushed out of the house.	3.960529215953799
9932. then she heard julia phone	me.	9.44413807006696
9933. nellie went on with her house work- until i found julia dead.	4.0683852436856025
9934. and before you say it nellie ain't near strong enough to have	strangled julia.	5.908977174908579

10128. a few snowflakes sifted down through that theatrical red glow	languid as falling feathers.	6.033937936086792
10129. hastily the boy switched on a ceiling	light.	4.913686410369733
10130. the room looked normal and even commonplace.	6.1599194186780295
10131. there was	no hint of a violent struggle now.	5.729013562587116
10132. deal furniture with a mahogany finish	was neatly arranged as if it stood in the window of a department	store.	5.429832706382735
10133. the blue rug was suspiciously bright and new.	4.117016685177837
10134. it had never been	stained with blood.	9.407776746873678
10135. table covers and towels were clean ashtrays	empty and supplied with fresh matches.	4.0683852436856025
10136. the mirror over the bureau was	a blank eye round and innocent.	5.187735111958531
10137. alec played the part of an innocent	tourist.	6.172919282337135
10138. is there anything wrong with this room?	8.88526248635884
10139. 	n-no.	10.144513917544229
10140. the boy dropped his eyes.	6.872792046867227
10141. afraid you'll	lose your job if you don't keep your mouth shut?	4.182602481535312
10142.    the boy	raised his eyes.	6.996493558081793
10143. if you want my advice pack up	and take the next train back to new york.	4.585306761418352
10144. were you on	duty here two weeks ago?	6.743273855772659
10145.    the boy hesitated.	5.9839585825870545
10146. but i wouldn't spend a night in here for a million	bucks!   he was in a hurry to get out of the room.	7.198346600244331
10147. alec	gave him a tip and let him go.	4.845706724270516
10148. alone alec examined the doors.	7.712079578137997
10149. there were three- one leading to a bathroom one to the hall and	one to the room next door which was immovable- locked or bolted on	the other side.	3.806424660560942
10150. alec locked the hall door and put the key with his	watch on the bedside table.	5.2288514545018705
10151. it was just quarter of nine.	6.046353040516036
10152. as	he ranged his belongings on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust	on the dark surface of the wood beyond the linen cover.	4.943439010678235
10153. not gray like	the dust that collects in an unused room but white.	4.549900371632714
10154. women didn't	use white face powder nowadays he recalled.	6.50814511527265
10155. they used pink tan or	cream powder.	5.666780198513088
10156. alec glanced into the bathroom.	7.712079578137997
10157. blood in the	bathtub where the murderer appears to have washed his hands.	4.109361198762808
10158. it seemed	clean now but alec decided against a bath.	6.941915920677784
10159. he crawled into bed and	switched off the light.	4.862373123883983
10160. in the darkness he could see the rosy	reflection of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window.	6.089954525708269
10161. it winked	as steadily as a metronome- on off- on off.	4.834770518737059
10162. in less than	five minutes	alec was asleep.	7.657199179310038
10163. he never knew just what woke him.	5.327318177452291
10164. yet	suddenly he was wide-awake.	8.457718703298294
10165. there was no sound and apparently no movement	in the room except the noiseless pulsation of the red light on	the wall.	4.371812684087517
10166. he lay still listening to the silence watching the	light.	6.375016808455901
10167. somewhere in the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn notes-	midnight.	5.524582370465535
10168. according to the medical examiner she was shot between	eleven pm and one am h.	6.327406989407398
10169. alec heard a faint sound.	5.619635421798327
10170. his heart seemed to swell and knock against the wall of his chest.	5.674516492584576
10171. for the sound was inside the room.	6.063392899147839
10172. he let his eyelids droop	and breathed heavily feigning sleep.	6.375016808455901
10173. the sound was coming nearer.	5.308387693592219
10174. a	monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall distorted and indefinable.	5.9245075971793435
10175. when the neon sign faded out the shadow disappeared.	5.231996826536962
10176. when the neon sign flashed on the shadow was still there.	6.5692492265144855
10177. it stretched	to an impossible height climbing the wall to the ceiling.	4.956921236248663
10178. that	meant that something between the light and its reflection on the wall	was moving closer to the source of the light- in this case the window.	5.949816218857127
10179. cautiously alec tensed his muscles ready to jump.	4.6724501027054846
10180. the bedsprings	betrayed him with a creak.	6.499352669237344
10181. someone	had moved beyond the range of the light from the window.	4.629361748776698
10182. abandoning	caution alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch.	6.11515297958643
10183. before he could snap it on a stinging blow caught him in the ribs.	5.3723817889533985
10184. he lashed out blindly with his right.	7.042834174643505
10185. there was a thick squashy crack	of fist on flesh.	6.003946298097668
10186. something hard grazed his knuckles.	8.777570358824025
10187. he	put everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought	to be.	3.8101576301595865
10188. rough cloth rasped his fist.	7.712079578137997
10189. there was a grunt curiously	inarticulate like that of an animal in pain.	5.875895461811275
10190. something heavy shook	the floor as it dropped.	7.496437431830457
10191. alec waited a moment on guard.	5.219666477665999
10192. again he groped for the light switch.	7.840063954995996
10193. the blue	rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room.	3.934243387066852
10194. on the	bare floorboards a man lay face down.	7.4757594845036355
10195. he had a short heavy powerful	body.	7.525556360283494
10196. alec turned him over and discovered a round lumpy face	with narrow slanting eyes- a primitive tartar face from russia	or the balkans.	4.807873378411027
10197. the man's shoes were too pointed his overcoat too	broad at the shoulders and too narrow at the waist.	3.390604280653994
10198. there was	a slight bulge under the left armpit- a shoulder holster.	7.064124745618699
10199. alec promptly	removed the gun.	6.162967476035402
10200. he was familiar with this type.	8.978850131353859
10201. he had seen it	in the lineup at police headquarters in new york in broadway night	clubs and seventh avenue pool rooms in the criminal courts.	4.28306348970546
10202. but	he was surprised to meet it here.	7.3247785719015885
10203. diana beauclerk had no connection	with the underworld.	4.913686410369733
10204. a professional gunman would not have killed	her with a weapon of such small caliber as a .	5.399327473082339
10205. nor would he	choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing when it would be	so much safer to take his victim for a one-way ride on a lonely country	road.	3.5528973284953564
10206. he opened his eyes.	9.409404246588942
10207. what are you doing here?	7.402479863932699
10208.  demanded alec.	11.155741451300253
10209. the man	made no reply.	5.098202453568707
10210. his lips were bruised and swollen	where alec had hit him.	6.1455369188967515
10211. did you kill diana beauclerk?	6.448167114333158
10212. 	alec expected an indignant denial but there was no response	at all.	6.937287210691976
10213. oh come on snap out of it! or i'll turn	you over to the police! the silence was getting on alec's	nerves.	4.0046654706634115
10214. the man opened his mouth but no words came.	6.7190519640354385
10215. only that	curious animal grunting alec had heard during their fight.	4.898094375807777
10216. don't you speak english?	8.457718703298294
10217.    the man opened his mouth	wider.	6.0751671436455945
10218. a forefinger pointed toward his gullet.	7.064901200998796
10219. alec leaned forward to	look.	6.162967476035402
10220. there were hideous scars inside the throat and the palate was	mutilated.	6.766861229611759
10221. in good time i shall get to the distressing actuality to red mciver	and handley walker to murder and sudden death.	3.79224471020433
10222. but you realize	i am sure how much old deeds incite to new ones and you must forgive	me if i tell you first of the old ones.	5.644018478530282
10223. it was in 1814 that	abraham wharf and his sister sat by a meager fire in their house	on dogtown common a desolate place even then.	3.931329727732427
10224. he was sharpening his	razor.	10.513280918417554
10225. sister said he do you think people who commit suicide	go to heaven?	4.319063512558064
10226.  and she answered i don't know but i hope	you'll never do such a thing.	6.0544980462271685
10227. without a tremor god forbid!	he said and went out and cut his throat in the cave near granny	day's swamp.	3.8879475099822502
10228. what has this to do with the present?	8.881082033700096
10229.  much	i assure you.	6.939425769494729
10230. you must know what gets into people even such as	red and handley before you can tell what comes out of them.	5.472017440484467
10231. they	had learned both of them about abraham wharf.	4.6724501027054846
10232. that's why i	beg	you not to forget him.	6.855972904844371
10233. his ghost is not laid.	5.949600585200961
10234. red and handley god	help them knew the old dogtown lore; and i knew they knew it for	i'd told them a lot of it.	5.321710995408571
10235. and isn't it true that you get a deeper	perception about a man and his motives when you know what it is	he knows?	4.108255950319037
10236.    yes gentlemen i am getting to the point to my	point.	8.118610104095023
10237. you know the facts; they are set forth in your own newspapers.	5.792579547710628
10238. you want from me the story but a story is about 'why' and then	perhaps about 'how'.	5.724446891816865
10239. the 'when' you know; yesterday morning.	4.484814815711922
10240. so what i am trying to tell you is the 'why'- that is my	point- and that concerns the spirit of the matter.	6.4415523910056125
10241. there is an	inwardness and a luster to old furniture	which has a provocative emanation if i may say so.	4.05299813688397
10242. places	too have their haunting qualities.	7.712079578137997
10243. and my point	in this sad story is the spirit of the matter.	5.29933157861707
10244. when you hold the spirit	of a thing then somehow you know the truth- you know a fake antique	from the real thing.	5.823248654894072
10245. and the truth is what you've come for is	it not?	5.670648761860092
10246.    now dogtown is one of those places that creeps into	the marrow as worms get into old wood under the veneer.	6.365984013270682
10247. in fact	all the folk who lived on the back of cape ann they are not just like	others.	4.775623033605585
10248. there's a different hall-mark on them.	7.59447260732681
10249. there were no witch	burnings here because everyone had a witch in the family.	4.868943195175992
10250. just think	of old granther stannard who pulled the teeth of dark younger	and because he bungled the job and left	two protruding tusks she put such a hex on him that he thought his legs	were made of glass.	4.826445039529161
10251. after that he was never known to run or even walk	fast.	5.963982618434337
10252. today dogtown is the only deserted village in all new england	that i know of.	6.8001006068079795
10253. there it sits a small highland with towns like	gloucester near by; but now it's the most lost and tortured place	in the world.	3.8098881638018414
10254. those who lived in that desolation of rocky deformity	took on some of the moraine's stony character.	6.857592077698614
10255. scientists say it	is the last spewings of a great glacier but one rather feels that only	a malevolent giant could have piled up those crouching monsters of granite	which still seem to preserve a sort of suspended ominous life	in them.	3.5271289181677634
10256. we'll walk up there later.	7.712079578137997
10257. it's perhaps a mile from	here where we sit.	4.6724501027054846
10258. and not one single dwelling left there though	once in the early eighteenth century there were close to a hundred	houses.	6.060928448548204
10259. even i can	remember nothing but ruined cellars and tumbled pillars and nobody has	lived there in the memory of any living man.	4.312438550207371
10260. it is now a sweep of boulders	and ledges with oak walnut and sumac creeping across the common	and everywhere the ruins and the long long shadows.	5.126793154763172
10261. that's	your setting and a sinister one.	5.219666477665999
10262. please get that in your reports.	7.163184125958424
10263. it accounts for so many things.	6.738417589055847
10264. both red mciver and handley walker	lived nearby almost as near as i do.	5.925611049833344
10265. red lived at lanesville	and from his house he could be up on the common in a half hour's	brisk walk; handley lived further on at pigeon cove.	4.01508051780622
10266. i'd often	find one or other of them up around dogtown sketching.	5.739974350684024
10267. they were	both	painters well	anyhow dogtown common is so much off the beaten track nowadays	that only sunday picnickers still stray up there from time to	time.	3.6137181885910907
10268. sea-road railroad lack of water killed dogtown.	7.0752818734601375
10269. dead dead	as a brass door nail and i sometimes feel like the sexton for i'm	about the last to be even interested.	3.7818744946034597
10270. i knew red and handley	well.	9.836023047470407
10271. as i said they were both painters.	6.380035570206664
10272. they'd come separately	to gloucester some twenty years ago- there's always been an	artists' colony somewhere on cape ann- and each married here.	4.807873378411027
10273. they married cousins anta and freya norberg.	5.295767400278317
10274. there are a lot of	scandinavians in this neck of the woods and many still make painted	furniture and take steam-baths.	5.8118693958271015
10275. pretty girls among them with blonde	hair and pert faces.	4.524937163380168
10276. handley married freya and red of the red beard	married anta.	6.732908025930051
10277. and it was because of an old norberg inheritance that	i got to understand them all so well.	4.664459802450146
10278. the quarrel ended in a ridiculous	draw but i must tell you about it.	5.038219612497489
10279. oh yes i'm quite sure	it's important because of the beech pasture.	5.3822110247967565
10280. what's that?	11.155741451300253
10281. 	why that's what gave me the feeling gave me as-it-were the spirit	the demoniac evil spirit of this whole affair.	3.5853166747464886
10282. you see besides	being custodian of antiquities i am also registrar.	6.9169463876473225
10283. no i don't	hold with those who live entirely among dead things.	4.958100209562813
10284. i know as	well as the next man that a ship is called from the rigging she carries	where the live wind blows and not from the hull.	4.9776132994554905
10285. but you've got	to know both.	6.236627984188189
10286. what's below the water-line interests me also.	6.743273855772659
10287. as i	was saying i've known all about the old records including the old	norberg deed.	4.18936468883597
10288. some ten years ago that page was torn out i don't	know by whom.	6.199121869629583
10289. about five years ago handley came to ask me if he	could see the tattered register.	4.567079656408706
10290. he was courteous and casual about it	as though it were of no consequence.	6.200559515196356
10291. he's always like that in spite	of being a big man.	4.317068102383446
10292. of fingering i might almost say stroking a large mole with black hairs	a sensual man but very courteous some	would say slick.	5.217864789376082
10293. like his glossy black hair.	7.205379045475391
10294. too many outside manners	to my taste.	8.811152413841366
10295. he is the sort who with an appraising eye would	cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then pinch her.	3.9004916376918555
10296. a real gentleman i feel would do neither.	6.598860541176088
10297. he's always worn	a broad-brimmed hat and i've noticed in my small study at the society	that he rather smells of cosmetics.	3.718928610446729
10298. the next week cousin red	wandered in as casually but curt and untidy.	5.57958240599286
10299. red was small and fine-boned	like ivory-inlay.	5.769755029776405
10300. he too asked to see the same page.	8.295530080456077
10301. when i	told him someone had torn it out he shouted.	4.796480531248612
10302. by god it's that	damn handley the sneak! and later in the same week they both	came together to examine the register.	5.980829737026771
10303. fortunately we were alone in	the building- so few people nowadays are interested even in their own	past or in the lovely craft of other days- for they began to abuse	each other in the foulest language.	3.5352114981885485
10304. red thrusting out his tawny beard	handley glowering under his suddenly rumpled black hair.	5.779262170001642
10305. le rouge et le noir.	5.685809527696587
10306. red always	was morose yet that day the dapper handley was the louder of the	two.	5.636627737169929
10307. but for my presence they would have been at each others' throats.	5.862364017602301
10308. during the quarrel i learned what the trouble was from	the accusations each hurled at the other.	5.936515372671284
10309. the beech pasture had	suddenly	become valuable.	4.747750369463677
10310. there's a fine granite quarry there and granite's	coming back for public buildings.	5.790605438075149
10311. both men knew it was in the	norberg family holdings but to which of the cousins did it belong	anta or freya?	4.285644684749282
10312.  fortunately i knew almost exactly what the will	had said.	6.782166783020374
10313. it began with a preamble of course.	5.963759819504082
10314. this explained that the	judge of probate of essex county 1785 or 1786 appointed three free-holders	of gloucester to divide and establish the norberg estate.	4.829538790541463
10315. after the usual honorable sirs it went on to say that there had	been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of	the deceased salu norberg one lower room on the western side privileges	to the well and bake-oven and to one third of the cellar	also one cow right and lastly	they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as	dower namely the beech pasture.	3.589891033212701
10316. and i remember that the whole of	the privileges not counting the beech pasture was valued at twenty	pounds.	6.021039068712483
10317. i wish you could have seen the crests fall on these two sparring	coxcombs when i told them that obviously the pasture belonged	to their wives jointly.	3.810288082784503
10318. that battle scene ridiculous at it was	remained in my mind.	6.634103445298675
10319. a disturbing picture of bad blood to be further	heightened with illicit if buccolic colors for on a subsequent day	i saw handley escorting anta red's wife up on dogtown common.	3.271049632011113
10320. i felt it would be inopportune to disclose my presence.	7.581573167172347
10321. not that	i intentionally go unperceived but the boulders up there are very high	and i am a small woman.	4.215051483257514
10322. one other cause of jealousy between them	i must tell you.	6.531722269573119
10323. paint! gloomy and unkempt as red mciver was	he was much the better painter.	3.9701983041559052
10324. i suppose handley knew it.	9.444824765004729
10325. if red	had a show at gloucester handley would hurry to hang his pictures in	rockport.	4.221361074171727
10326. you may say this has little pertinence but gentlemen	remember that all this prepared my mind alerted my intelligence.	5.581038111799267
10327. by	such touches the pattern takes shape.	5.219666477665999
10328. you would call these the motives	of crime.	8.60776193927925
10329. i would call them the patterns of life perhaps even the	designs of destiny.	4.601429207829643
10330. yet with all this knowledge i had nothing of substance	to unravel our case as you would call it till yesterday.	5.515730557378876
10331. one month ago on the 20th of october was the opening of the gunning	season in massachusetts.	4.437510547690986
10332. not much to shoot but there are a few	pheasant.	9.401263429228052
10333. rabbits too if you care for them which most of the folk	around here haven't the sense to appreciate.	4.162313583637461
10334. any more than they have	the sense to eat mussels.	8.476803210011433
10335. that was the day red was said to have	gone away.	6.634635983998171
10336. oh yes he'd talked about doing so.	7.573472848649923
10337. in fact he often disappeared	from time to time- off to paint the sea aboard a dragger	out from gloucester.	4.188721860694301
10338. anta his wife never seemed to mind.	7.120774155171106
10339. i suppose	these absences gave her more clearance for her embraces with cousin	handley.	4.344767340770036
10340. anyhow i wasn't surprised early that morning to see	handley himself crossing from dogtown common road to the back	road.	4.985333447698777
10341. no he didn't have his gun which he should have.	4.833467107609993
10342. it would	have been a good excuse for his being there at all.	6.164871464748975
10343. i myself had been	up there by seven o'clock after mushrooms since there'd been a	week of rain which had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear	as sandwich glass.	3.536781699928111
10344. that's what the man had said.	7.565601895320114
10345. haney peered doubtfully at his	drinking companion through bleary tear-filled eyes.	4.317068102383446
10346. he had no ready	answer as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing.	6.466602629083919
10347. was the	man drunk or crazy or both?	5.607604462623494
10348.  but his new-found buddy had matched him	drink for drink until he lost count and the man's eyes were still	clear.	5.4823145536786475
10349. the guy is off his rocker haney thought to himself	and looked away from those eyes.	3.5766561223977624
10350. eyes that were clear but also bright	with a strange intensity a sort of cold fire burning behind them.	5.467117446227736
10351. why hadn't he noticed it before?	6.238836969946059
10352.  no the man was not drunk h	he wondered how he got tied up with this stranger.	6.110448323969902
10353. but of course	he remembered now.	6.228049301350979
10354. it was blurred after two hours of steady drinking	but the occasion of it came back to him.	5.631496704208261
10355. the stranger his head	seemingly sunk in thought started to cross the street against the	light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection.	3.225421653469569
10356. brakes howled and a horn blared furiously but the man would have	been hit if phil hadn't called out to him a second before.	4.818712279342798
10357. his shout	had been involuntary something anybody might have done without thinking	on the spur of the moment.	3.9833975032428923
10358. as a matter of fact he wouldn't	have cared at all if the guy had been hit.	6.76422844292767
10359. actually he regretted having	opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver	jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them.	3.9577591705444277
10360. by then	the stranger was thanking haney profusely and had one arm around his	shoulders as if he were an old friend.	5.745140336478679
10361. so the driver started to curse	at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his	safe-driving record.	4.996792062537335
10362. then the man he saved turned and looked	squarely into the truck driver's face without saying a word.	5.666847292494068
10363. very	suddenly the driver stopped swearing at them turned on his heel and	went back to his truck.	3.8399768524654823
10364. haney hadn't given it much thought at	the time.	6.412214371980113
10365. now he recalled it very clearly and wondered what the truck	driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off.	3.815138022940029
10366. it must have	been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word.	6.123119691356395
10367. when the light went their way they went on across the street.	4.6167105910206985
10368. and	when the stranger found out that phil was on the way to one of his	favorite bars he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them.	5.821311221748228
10369. phil usually went alone and kept to himself sitting in a corner	and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges.	3.542415248362911
10370. but he decided	he wouldn't mind company in return for free drinks even though	he made good money at his job.	5.776192062524712
10371. now	he wondered	if it was worth it having a screwball for company.	4.182602481535312
10372. he really	didn't take the offer seriously but he began to feel uneasy.	6.367270912313055
10373. when	he finally got the coughing under control he realized that pete	was still waiting for an answer- he didn't	even seem to wink as he continued to stare.	3.3633779882059027
10374. haney managed	a weak laugh.	8.457718703298294
10375. guess i can't think of anyone pete.	5.377370862457837
10376. a faint crease appeared between the man's eyebrows.	6.338700895917011
10377. i think you aren't taking me seriously phil.	6.281854480918796
10378. and	everybody has some kind of grudge.	8.424954260254033
10379. i might have got hit by that truck	if it wasn't for you.	4.496884221562987
10380. i believe in returning favors.	11.11949420187085
10381. i'll do	anything for somebody i like.	5.219666477665999
10382. it won't cost you a cent phil.	7.788832957144139
10383. go	ahead and try me!   phil rubbed his forehead wearily.	4.477601198394805
10384. he	was beginning to feel woolly.	7.811977069529017
10385. maybe it would be better to humor the	guy and then make an exit.	5.11931702419859
10386. he really didn't expect anything to come	of it and there were a few people h   all right	he	conceded finally if you must know i don't get along with the	landlord.	5.167882484418445
10387. he keeps riding me because i like to listen to the radio	and sing while i'm taking a bath.	4.028225385734705
10388. he says the neighbors complain	but i don't believe it.	8.01925471253262
10389. why don't they tell me themselves if it	bothers them?	5.136067290364826
10390.    the man closed his eyes and nodded.	7.52293631122221
10391. when he	looked up again he seeemd almost contented.	5.283245066789037
10392. it will take a little time.	10.339997520156492
10393. i want to study your landlord's	habits and movements first.	5.499321210316948
10394. you see i always make it look like	an accident.	7.260138928419723
10395. maybe suicide if it looks reasonable.	6.0352481523727795
10396. in that way there's	no trouble for the customer.	7.637281189752294
10397. customer?	10.144513917544229
10398.    pete smiled modestly.	10.683207024016218
10399. it's my	line of work he said h   five minutes later before haney	could make his break the stranger stood up and nodded farewell.	3.598816771635357
10400. haney	watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently	and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure.	4.869150388184834
10401. phil decided to stay a little longer and as time passed	it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there but for	the other glass on the table.	3.658532982595563
10402. some time before midnight he returned	to his apartment and hit the sack putting the whole incident out of	mind before he fell asleep.	5.251137462430478
10403. the next day sunday the hangover	reminded haney where he had been the night before.	5.401138360421354
10404. the hangover	in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy and he	groaned.	5.426677492969238
10405. he went for more aspirin later in the day and passed the surly	landlord on the way- he was still alive and scowling as usual	as if tenants were a burden in his life.	3.754960319250093
10406. phil shrugged and ignored him.	7.712079578137997
10407. he went back to work monday.	6.626787238494706
10408. by wednesday the landlord was	still alive.	8.15392802769807
10409. of course h on thursday haney mailed the monthly	check for separate maintenance to his wife lolly and wished the stranger	could do something about her h   coming home from work	he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment	building.	3.661642423220035
10410. inside the lobby people were standing around talking excitedly.	6.922331069300521
10411. his spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one	of his fellow tenants what had happened.	3.7765671693546152
10412. late that afternoon it seemed he had fallen off the roof while	on some obscure errand or inspection.	5.0954132063661275
10413. he had apparently been alone.	7.233590387266771
10414. nobody	witnessed the fall- just the sickening impact when his body smashed	on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance.	5.02889680741886
10415. haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor as he felt the	blood drain from his cheeks.	3.744109221929566
10416. he muttered something about how terrible	it was and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator.	5.362099888262211
10417. once	inside his apartment he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped	limply in a chair.	3.8101576301595865
10418. after a while he began to feel better about	it especially when no one bothered to ask any questions.	5.994326830260204
10419. but after	all why should they?	6.236627984188189
10420.  still later he finally convinced himself	that it was an accident- just a coincidence.	6.492222809046511
10421. the stranger really	had nothing to do with it of course h   haney went to bed	happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord.	3.696207849810633
10422. after all the	man had no family so no one suffered and everybody was better off	for it.	5.834770871331453
10423. really he said to himself nobody kills a man just as a favor!	so you thought i didn't mean what i said.	3.6717688412838356
10424. the stranger's	eyes were large and sad as if phil haney had hurt his feelings.	4.900432726990401
10425. it was like a recurrent annoying dream but now the dream was	beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare.	4.208857464985791
10426. however haney	knew it was not a dream.	10.461218212093057
10427. he might be very tight but he knew where	he was.	4.9542354509226705
10428. it was the same bar and it was two weeks later- saturday	night when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual.	6.4303782777785745
10429. he	had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table as far as possible	from any talkative friendly lushes.	4.078321777800607
10430. he was enjoying the weekly	ritual of washing down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened	with water.	5.605390629947532
10431. this favorite grievance was not the landlord.	5.869582493601168
10432. he had	already quite forgotten about him.	7.5139871259533155
10433. in fact he had only mentioned him	on the spur of the moment.	5.166168918666112
10434. his real grievance was lolly.	8.16490567933018
10435. toward	the end of his fourth hairy highball while he was moodily making	wet rings on the table-top with the bottom of the glass he became	aware that he was not alone.	4.1774323813517125
10436. he looked up with bloodshot eyes and beheld	the stranger sitting across the table smiling a secret smile at him	as if they were fellow conspirators.	5.014469548268354
10437. he hadn't even noticed-	what was his name?	5.131969917669621
10438.  pete?	13.921774766768346
10439. - he hadn't seen him sit down.	4.913686410369733
10440. the man	was uncanny like a shadow and made as much noise as a shadow.	4.900432726990401
10441. haney felt like shrinking out of sight but he was already trapped	in the corner with the wiry dark little man.	3.990194001123005
10442. he began to wish that	he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through	the crossing.	5.8062879520461905
10443. was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep	for a bar-buddy?	5.097340281473263
10444.  he'd have to start going to some of the other places	again.	8.230609224038187
10445. in a low voice almost whispering the man had asked	phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off	his back.	4.318883078881795
10446. he made the mistake of answering in an offhand way and instantly	realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice.	5.254073982238241
10447. pete frowned slightly then became sad and moody.	4.996450729242316
10448. haney	didn't want to encourage his company but felt he ought to buy him a	drink anyhow to prevent possible trouble.	5.03982293829454
10449. but there was no trouble.	9.377174250279197
10450. the guy sulked over his drink obviously upset by haney's lack of	appreciation.	5.1792854312851535
10451. to break the uncomfortable silence haney began	to talk.	5.113481187507758
10452. in time and two drinks later he was complaining bitterly	about his wife he was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he	noticed the renewed interest in his listener- it showed in the alert	face and the suddenly bright eyes.	5.0809854291380985
10453. when he paused to moisten	his throat the stranger broke in.	5.313668979530054
10454. but why pay her bills?	9.779623465454963
10455.  if she	runs around with other men and if you hate her as you say why not	just divorce her?	4.316149652793387
10456.    haney scowled.	11.155741451300253
10457. that bitch would love	a divorce he growled.	5.674616284194667
10458. then she'd get half of everything i	have.	7.498046420169647
10459. community property deal- you know.	6.27470342965113
10460. i'd have to sell out	my business to pay her off with her share.	5.499353804260862
10461. she can drop dead!	pete nodded understandingly.	6.389357606724279
10462. you must	understand i haven't been in this state too long.	6.922524179316523
10463. i came out here	to retire.	6.982987765108453
10464. that's why i- why i do a free job now and then.	5.647214178267959
10465. you	should have told me about her before.	4.913686410369733
10466. haney felt a twinge	of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again.	5.60175281454767
10467. then a wild	thought ran circles through his clouded brain.	5.067625140959219
10468. suppose- just suppose	this guy was really what he said he was! a retired professional killer	h if he was just a nut no harm was done.	5.3296064068298135
10469. but if he was the	real thing he could do something about lolly.	5.6129187667831575
10470. he felt very cunning	very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot.	6.528589375231718
10471. no offense intended he said gently.	5.9905667560537506
10472. but it's just that-	well you know.	7.8672625272876715
10473. the cops didn't suspect a thing and i thought	it was a coincidence.	3.700289227276755
10474. after all i didn't know you pete.	8.496814470004358
10475. it	could have been an accident.	6.4237579402884535
10476. but if	you say you managed it h the stranger was hooked.	6.110193592166714
10477. yes yes he muttered impatiently.	6.758778698007682
10478. of course	it looked like an accident.	8.789326822784348
10479. i always work it that way- and always	at a time when the customer has an alibi.	4.409331330721665
10480. let me prove it phil.	10.159275657379208
10481. i	think i can manage one more favor for you.	4.477601198394805
10482. haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass.	6.818339658643393
10483. about halfway back pops groped against a wall and stopped pulled away	two loosely nailed wide boards at one end and went through.	3.8365629396361953
10484. c'mon	he whispered; floor level's about three feet down so	don't fall.	5.9245075971793435
10485. i went through and down into pitch darkness.	5.097275438242154
10486. he said	jist stay still.	8.978600574448244
10487. i'll pull the boards back and then get us	a light.	4.317068102383446
10488. jist stay where you are.	7.712079578137997
10489. i jist stayed where i was while	he fumbled around and then walked away.	4.223549308229146
10490. a moment later he struck a	match and lighted a candle and i could see.	5.289858898972549
10491. it was a big room	empty except for a few things of pop's at the far end- a wooden	crate on which stood the candle a spread out blanket and an unrolled	bindle.	4.090967854903097
10492. i looked back over my shoulder while i went to join him;	he'd hung another half of a blanket over the boarded window so no	light would show through.	4.963198407297221
10493. i took the pint bottle from my pocket	and handed it over as i sat down beside him on the spread blanket.	3.79542399088468
10494. he drank and handed it back.	7.685159307701091
10495. nice	place i told him.	6.162967476035402
10496. listen i got a buddy i travel with	real nice guy named larry.	5.816432690752674
10497. i know where he is right near here.	6.641950668759042
10498. could	he join the party and sleep here tonight too?	6.337862002335542
10499.  we'll both be blowing	town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you.	3.9701983041559052
10500. he hesitated	a second looking at the bottle before he said sure-sure	and i reassured him.	5.653450033679012
10501. he'll bring a bottle too and i'll	get another one or maybe two while i'm out.	3.8101576301595865
10502. you can work on this	one while i'm gone kill it if you want.	6.269930329103924
10503. i took a short swallow	from it myself and handed it to him.	4.567929058835636
10504. his sure-sure was	enthusiastic this time.	8.16490567933018
10505. he put the bottle down.	6.678641617638617
10506. git over by the window	while there's light an' i'll put th' candle out.	5.632305849491864
10507. when	yuh come back i'll put it out agin till you're both inside.	4.0683852436856025
10508. charlie was waiting leaning against a building front.	6.412214371980113
10509. perfect	set-up i told him.	6.162967476035402
10510. but we got to go back to fifth and get	another bottle or two.	6.725211272852901
10511. on the way i'll give you the scoop.	6.481645035907892
10512. on the way i gave him the scoop.	10.402157071361916
10513. i bought another pint of sherry	and when we got back pops let us in in the dark put back the blanket	and then lighted the candle again.	3.756320364677722
10514. i introduced my friend larry	to pops and we made ourselves comfortable.	6.156832949080374
10515. there was still a little	not much left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and	killed it and charlie opened his.	4.65084652903822
10516. i was reminded amusedly	by a poem of kenneth patchen's called the murder of two men	by a young kid wearing lemon colored gloves which patchen himself	read on a record against jazz background.	4.883140596296189
10517. the poem consisted of	only two words the word wait repeated over and over at irregular	intervals and with different inflections and then the word now!	and a blaring final chord from the jazz group.	3.3721156703127506
10518. this was	the same except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither	of us was wearing gloves.	6.716800341497741
10519. but we could wait all right; there	was no hurry.	5.626447281371439
10520. i said wait h wait to charlie and he grinned	digging the reference.	5.957971082207336
10521. we'd heard the record together once.	5.219666477665999
10522. the second bottle passed a few times.	7.008364675975134
10523. pop was taking long ones but	not showing the effect yet.	4.317068102383446
10524. he seemed as drunk as when i'd first	talked to him but no drunker.	5.931970515776641
10525. he had a capacity; if we'd really	been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more	wine.	4.772397621973253
10526. about halfway through the second bottle charlie looked	at me across pops who was sitting between us and asked now?	5.299257370906322
10527. 	i said wait and handed the bottle to pops for his final	drink.	4.0683852436856025
10528. when he handed it back and i had hold of it safely pops was	looking toward me and i said now to charlie and he swung	the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket	once.	4.789381058768766
10529. it was a lead pipe cinch.	6.800453346408791
10530. there was a sound like the one	you produce by flicking a watermelon with your finger only louder	and pops fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise.	5.256188157337068
10531. out cold	if not dead; and he'd never known what hit him- he'd never	known that anything had hit him.	3.972754337075096
10532. i reached my hand toward	him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a heartbeat but charlie	said wait!- and said it sharply not as in the patchen bit	but as an order- so i stopped my hand and looked at him.	4.698635368229741
10533. he was	holding the piece of lead pipe out to me.	4.467047448170571
10534. we don't want to	know whether he's dead yet.	7.106778255050199
10535. i gauged that blow to be borderline.	5.406629921006237
10536. to kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill.	6.680428949416473
10537. you hit again about twice	that hard before we know whether he's dead or not.	4.384988773997789
10538. that way we'll	never know which of us really killed him and which was just the accomplice.	6.135632519292701
10539. dig?	10.144513917544229
10540.    i dug him i saw his point; it made sense.	6.38667026629645
10541. i took the piece of pipe from charlie's hand and used it harder	than he had.	4.125014472779614
10542. the thunk was louder anyway and i thought i heard	bone crack.	5.433726734570658
10543. that did it if mine	didn't.	6.700422769264972
10544. and we'll never know which.	8.442981267884216
10545. all right now i'll give	you a hand.	5.570692249242327
10546. we straightened pops up and i made sure there	was no trace of a heartbeat.	5.709802046053646
10547. let's	put him down again the way he was.	4.8573305477548825
10548. it's a more natural position.	8.414717357766277
10549. how do you feel?	8.293691296028912
10550.  charlie asked me.	9.52328749892442
10551. what do you feel?	9.188024454579084
10552.    nothing.	13.921774766768346
10553. well h maybe i'm exaggerating.	6.877390903555252
10554. it was a kick but not	a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again except for	stakes.	6.167847955753037
10555. but let's not talk about it abstractly until we're out of	here.	4.452373707595423
10556. now first question: the bottles.	9.04425245534422
10557. shall we take them all with	us or leave one?	4.533092802769459
10558.    take them i said.	10.241908687866472
10559. if we	left one we'd have to wipe it for fingerprints.	4.80359388030365
10560. here's the picture	we want to leave for the fuzz- whenever the body gets found.	5.331440467598945
10561. this	happened in the middle of a drinking bout with another bum.	5.084091298481977
10562. if they'd	been working on a bottle or a jug he'd have taken it with him.	5.993982502861801
10563. and he'd have taken the weapon with him too so	we take that.	4.4202972447834625
10564. i've been careful	about fingerprints.	8.731063118701451
10565. there are	the boards over the window of course but they're not painted and too	rough to take prints.	4.1810755526806185
10566. same goes for the rough cement of the ledge.	6.144814417540349
10567. besides i doubt if the cops will even try dusting.	4.860259090747889
10568. they find dead	winos every day maybe they won't even autopsy him for the cause of	death.	5.513892870660759
10569. we can't take a chance on that.	5.497086847134583
10570. we've got to	assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the	picture consistent.	5.2288514545018705
10571. our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have	turned out his pockets.	4.384406067719352
10572. we did that and found	a dirty handkerchief some matches and fourteen cents in change.	6.013115008466838
10573. we	took the matches- they were book matches and once they'd been touched	might retain fingerprints- and the change.	3.685338251241182
10574. we discussed	the candle and decided the hypothetical other bum would have left it	burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reason	to blow it out.	5.208530006464275
10575. the candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't	set fire to the crate when it guttered out.	3.4050747556413716
10576. a fire wouldn't have	mattered except that it would cause pops to be found sooner.	6.8140251472364115
10577. he	might not be found for days even weeks otherwise.	4.477601198394805
10578. we went once	more over every point then triple-checked.	7.106778255050199
10579. being picked up for questioning	by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining	danger and we weren't picked up by a cop.	4.502093577969932
10580. in fact nobody saw	us cop or citizen.	8.28528324063632
10581. winsett is a quiet street with no taverns and was	completely deserted at that hour.	4.091386426352012
10582. which if it matters was one am.	8.05452818759275
10583. less than three hours ago we'd decided in maxine wells's	pad on cosmo to commit a trial murder.	4.165389948721754
10584. it had gone like clockwork.	11.018761446951316
10585. almost too smoothly i found myself thinking and then told	myself that was ridiculous.	4.423064446836819
10586. how safe is too safe?	9.335818014505
10587.  thinking like that	can get you into a padded pad.	4.477601198394805
10588. an hour later we were back	in my unpadded pad killing what had been left of the second pint.	6.37868658446265
10589. we	decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow.	4.973139121991806
10590. also our plans for	me to commit charlie's murder and for him to commit mine.	6.224927114709573
10591. but we	were really going to do it.	6.181228218912541
10592. we shook hands on it.	8.845542587831394
10593. we planned	ahead only one step a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap notes.	4.160616537259164
10594. i'd tell him everything i'd learned about seaton's habits	and habitat and he'd tell me the score on radic.	4.985333447698777
10595. we made the date	for two o'clock in the afternoon at maxine wells's pad.	4.744525152874695
10596. charlie	would get there early because he had the key.	7.463974281209507
10597. from here on in the	less charlie and i were seen together in public or visited one another's	rooms the better.	3.9510230063263925
10598. i was dead tired and slept soundly	as far as i know dreamlessly.	7.133852956870182
10599. we met at maxine's and decided	we were set to stay as long as it took into or even through the	evening to talk things out.	3.8816308049888186
10600. charlie had brought food and we'd decided	on no drinks.	6.144814417540349
10601. i'd brought along the virgin pint from last night	but we were going to kill that only when we were through talking.	3.8636604733888174
10602. i talked first telling him everything i knew about seaton and	his house and domestic arrangements.	5.526418119918482
10603. i drew diagrams and floor plans;	he memorized them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces	and flushed them down.	3.785942804592004
10604. he gave me equivalent and even more detailed	dope on radic including diagrams- one of the apartment building	radic lived in and one of the apartment itself.	6.262041081406331
10605. he'd been there several	times back when while he and radic had been friends or at least	not enemies.	3.685338251241182
10606. it didn't take us as long as we'd thought	it might; it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and charlie	said well i guess that's it.	5.754693013188752
10607. shall we flip a coin to see	which of us goes first?	4.2274897583360955
10608.  or would you rather deal a hand of show-down	poker or play a game of gin rummy or what?	5.475872801353228
10609.    wait a	minute charlie i said.	5.619635421798327
10610. one thing we haven't discussed expense	money.	9.264278917618249
10611. we'll need some at least if only bus fare to the	scene of the crime.	3.8849121559715263
10612. and if you're as flat broke as i am i think	we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station	or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while	the other does his dirty work.	5.387931779249697
10613. all right i'll	come clean.	7.323686657332166
10614. i've got a little stashed for a rainy day and i	guess this is rainy enough.	5.42450326306151
10615. if you draw the short	straw i'll lend you some bread like fifty bucks before i take	off to visit my sister in frisco.	3.8140593684410744
10616. then after i'm back another	fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi	somewhere while i take care of your seat cover boy.	5.560033383481178
10617. i took a deep breath and the plunge.	5.099353433116366
10618. in that case	let's not draw.	9.738267832944507
10619. i'll go to bat first.	5.619635421798327
10620. you'd have to wait till seaton's	back from mexico city and also while i set it up with doris	to have her have an alibi for d-night.	4.858107239583301
10621. so it wouldn't be	for days or even a week before you could do anything.	4.606882317087255
10622. but your friend	manny can go any time.	7.343223252109154
10623. he grinned and clapped me on the shoulder.	5.631968415191834
10624. i was hoping you'd say that willy.	8.267388591772093
10625. but i wouldn't	have suggested it.	7.431588202801213
10626. well- in that case i take off tomorrow morning	for frisco.	5.9245075971793435
10627. and in case i brought the money with me.	5.447539405440941
10628. now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer	to his brothers merge without let.	5.840913264144925
10629. self's integrity was and	is and ever had been.	4.6724501027054846
10630. mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves	the many threes-fulfilled on mars corporate and discorporate the precious	few on earth- the unknown powers of three on earth that would	be his to merge with and cherish now that at last long waiting he	grokked and cherished himself.	4.232921629353537
10631. mike remained in trance; there	was much to grok loose ends to puzzle over and fit into his growing-	all that he had seen and heard and been at the archangel foster	tabernacle	h why bishop senator boone made him warily uneasy how miss	dawn ardent tasted like a water brother when she was not the smell	of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping up and down and	wailing-   jubal's conversations coming and going- jubal's	words troubled him most; he studied them compared them with what	he had been taught as a nestling struggling to bridge between languages	the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in.	3.102431255440359
10632. the word church which turned up over and over again among jubal's	words gave him knotty difficulty; there was no martian concept	to match it- unless one took church and worship and	god and congregation and many other words and equated them	to the totality of the only world he had known during growing-waiting	h then forced the concept back into english in that phrase which	had been rejected by jubal by mahmoud by digby.	4.29090454890506
10633. he was closer to understanding	it in english now although it could never have the inevitability of	the martian concept it stood for.	3.7559938355334124
10634. in his mind he spoke simultaneously	the english sentence and the martian word and felt closer grokking.	5.98097336561262
10635. repeating it like a student telling himself that the jewel is in the	lotus he sank into nirvana.	3.685338251241182
10636. before midnight he speeded his	heart resumed normal breathing ran down his check list uncurled and	sat up.	5.635905204503468
10637. he had been weary; now he felt light and gay and clear-headed	ready for the many actions he saw spreading out before him.	4.0904178785983945
10638. he felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity	for quiet.	5.929279364413667
10639. he stepped out into the hall was delighted to encounter	a water brother.	4.84730728346695
10640. my	you look chipper.	9.52328749892442
10641. i feel fine! where is everybody?	6.479514598427861
10642. 	asleep.	13.921774766768346
10643. ben and stinky went home an hour ago and people	started going to bed.	3.9701983041559052
10644. mike felt disappointed	that mahmoud had left; he wanted to explain his new grokking.	6.033903471467988
10645. i ought to be asleep too but i felt like a snack.	4.980177765762149
10646. are you hungry?	13.1608144470119
10647. 	sure i'm hungry!   come on there's	some cold chicken and we'll see what else.	3.9701983041559052
10648. they went downstairs	loaded a tray lavishly.	8.556649265585342
10649. it's	plenty warm.	8.12896173865557
10650. a fine idea mike agreed.	7.590090367957043
10651. warm	enough to swim- real indian summer.	5.219666477665999
10652. i'll switch on the floods.	7.712079578137997
10653. i'll carry the	tray.	6.939425769494729
10654. he could see in almost total darkness.	8.481391551427388
10655. jubal said that his	night-sight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown	up and mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to	it; his foster parents had taught him to see.	3.6725784810297064
10656. as for the night being	warm he would have been comfortable naked on mount everest but	his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and	pressure; he was considerate of their weakness once he learned of	it.	5.256015254612762
10657. but he was looking forward to snow- seeing for himself that each	tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual as he had	read- walking barefoot rolling in it.	3.899612081248818
10658. in the meantime he was	pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of	his water brother.	5.494244122978412
10659. i'll switch on	the underwater lights.	5.619635421798327
10660. that'll be plenty to eat by.	7.163184125958424
10661. mike liked having light up through the ripples; it was a goodness	beauty.	5.064277459921554
10662. they picnicked by the pool then lay back on the grass	and looked at stars.	6.1190006684965
10663. it is mars	isn't it?	7.142182093557318
10664.  or antares?	14.549072195049758
10665.    it is mars.	8.213217004394902
10666. mike?	13.921774766768346
10667. 	what are they doing on mars?	5.219666477665999
10668.    he hesitated;	the question was too wide for the sparse english language.	5.925879823256658
10669. on the	side toward the horizon- the southern hemisphere- it is spring;	plants are being taught to grow.	4.105224212895401
10670. 'taught to grow'?	9.52328749892442
10671. 	he hesitated.	8.12896173865557
10672. larry teaches plants to grow.	7.712079578137997
10673. but my people- martians i mean; i now grok you	are my people- teach plants another way.	3.923454666218497
10674. in the other hemisphere	it is growing colder and nymphs those who stayed alive through the	summer	are being brought into nests for quickening and more growing.	5.170407003700438
10675. of the humans we left at the equator one has discorporated	and the others are sad.	4.516317940400807
10676. yes i heard it in the news.	9.506568294479726
10677. mike had not heard it; he had not known it until asked.	4.248241312160814
10678. they should not be sad.	12.195115564441718
10679. mr booker t w jones food technician	first class is not sad; the old ones have cherished him.	3.9009294107654697
10680. he had his own face	dark and beautiful.	8.851599445954319
10681. oh dear!	mike h do you ever get homesick?	5.197170020599843
10682.  for mars?	13.261341450198229
10683.    at	first i was homesick he answered.	5.265281678710789
10684. he	rolled toward her and took her in his arms.	6.144814417540349
10685. but now i am not lonely.	7.500257408798191
10686. i grok i shall never be lonely again.	7.087047576225457
10687. mike darling-	they kissed and went on kissing.	4.913686410369733
10688. presently his water	brother said breathlessly.	8.558968283056682
10689. oh my! that was almost worse than	the first time.	4.939831152453617
10690. you are all right my brother?	9.609735968100761
10691. 	yes.	10.144513917544229
10692. a long time later	by cosmic clock she said mike?	7.716267806217349
10693.  is that- i mean 'do	you know'-   i know.	5.5244399346018875
10694. it is for growing closer.	10.642604341359304
10695. well h i've been ready a long time-	goodness we all have but h never mind dear; turn just a little.	3.821138742382161
10696. as they merged grokking together mike	said softly and triumphantly: thou art god.	6.283316324615605
10697. her answer	was not in words.	6.54737746395194
10698. then as their grokking made them ever closer	and mike felt himself almost ready to discorporate her voice called	him back: oh! h oh! thou art god!   we	grok god.	4.740388737375783
10699. on mars humans were building pressure	domes for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship.	3.9498801356414788
10700. this	went faster than scheduled as the martians were helpful.	6.144814417540349
10701. part of	the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a long-distance	plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of mars to make the planet more	friendly to future human generations.	3.6456415771876602
10702. the old ones neither	helped nor hindered this plan; time was not yet.	5.667977040174253
10703. their meditations	were approaching a violent cusp that would shape martian art for	many millennia.	4.229057172631037
10704. on earth elections continued and a very advanced poet	published a limited edition of verse consisting entirely of punctuation	marks and spaces; time magazine reviewed it and suggested that	the federation assembly daily record should be translated into	the medium.	4.614347036933755
10705. a colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs	of plants and mrs joseph douglas	was quoted as saying: i would no more sit down without flowers	on my table than without serviettes.	3.264627836062632
10706. a tibetan swami from palermo	sicily announced in beverly hills a newly discovered ancient	yoga discipline for ripple breathing which increased both pranha and	cosmic attraction between sexes.	4.742306362911694
10707. his chelas were required to assume	the	matsyendra posture dressed in hand-woven diapers while he read aloud	from rig-veda and an assistant guru examined their purses in another	room- nothing was stolen; the purpose was less immediate.	3.3044711599500145
10708. the president of the united states proclaimed the first sunday	in november as national grandmothers' day and urged america	to say it with flowers.	6.180546339431311
10709. a funeral parlor chain was indicted for price-cutting.	4.618964815664445
10710. fosterite bishops after secret conclave announced the	church's second major miracle: supreme bishop digby had been	translated bodily to heaven and spot-promoted to archangel ranking	with-but-after archangel foster.	4.63479892887524
10711. the glorious news had been held up	pending heavenly confirmation of the elevation of a new supreme bishop	huey short- a candidate accepted by the boone faction after	lots had been cast repeatedly.	3.3726300169570234
10712. l'unita and hoy published	identical denunciations of short's elevation l'osservatore	romano and the christian science monitor ignored it	times of india snickered at it and the manchester guardian	simply reported it- the fosterites in england were few but extremely	militant.	4.43405202698731
10713. digby was not pleased with his promotion.	4.913686410369733
10714. the	man from mars had interrupted him with his work half finished- and	that stupid jackass short was certain to louse it up.	4.826842195955701
10715. foster listened	with angelic patience until digby ran down then said listen	junior you're an angel now- so forget it.	3.632711015013689
10716. eternity is no time for	recriminations.	7.712079578137997
10717. you too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me.	5.044302472788413
10718. afterwards you did well enough.	7.712079578137997
10719. now that short is supreme bishop	he'll do all right he can't help it.	4.556076097714919
10720. same as with the popes.	8.756029006374169
10721. some of them were warts until they got promoted.	6.993989195969205
10722. check with one of	them go ahead- there's no professional jealousy here.	6.365440075578771
10723. digby calmed down but made one request.	4.913686410369733
10724. you can't touch him.	11.1064335578917
10725. you shouldn't have tried to.	7.159500218971222
10726. oh you	can submit a requisition for a miracle if you want to make a fool of	yourself.	7.108304331329258
10727. but i'm telling you it'll be turned down- you don't	understand the system yet.	4.1953064193797465
10728. the martians have their own setup different	from ours and as long as they need him we can't touch him.	5.4922782140681985
10729. they run their show their way- the universe has variety something	for everybody- a fact you field workers often miss.	3.7160475732842784
10730. you	mean this punk can brush me aside and i've got to hold still for	it?	5.331440467598945
10731.    i held still for the same thing didn't i?	6.16818263165703
10732. 	i'm helping you now am i not?	6.743273855772659
10733.  now look there's work to be	done and lots of it.	4.964809384951344
10734. the boss wants performance not gripes.	6.154713990487742
10735. if you	need a day off to calm down duck over to the muslim paradise and	take it.	4.411403999514672
10736. otherwise straighten your halo square your wings and dig	in.	6.814734583760867
10737. the sooner you act like an angel the quicker you'll feel angelic.	3.700289227276755
10738. get happy junior!   digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh.	6.647927180003413
10739. where do i start?	8.107195047379571
10740.    jubal did	not hear of digby's disappearance when it was announced and when	he did while he had a fleeting suspicion he dismissed it; if mike	had had a finger in it he had gotten away with it- and what happened	to supreme bishops worried jubal not at all as long as he wasn't	bothered.	5.057727281160861
10741. his household had gone through an upset.	5.148511793411897
10742. jubal deduced	what had happened but did not know with whom- and didn't want	to inquire.	5.660213832756079
10743. mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself	in the clinches.	3.9701983041559052
10744. anyhow it was high time the boy was salted.	6.644126908659074
10745. jubal couldn't reconstruct the crime from the way the girls behaved	because patterns kept shifting- abc vs d then bcd	vs a h or ab vs cd or ad	vs	cb through all ways that four women can gang up on each	other.	3.3397267063560436
10746. this continued most of the week following that ill-starred	trip to church during which period mike stayed in his room and usually	in a trance so deep that jubal would have pronounced him dead	had he not seen it before.	4.8433615548964335
10747. jubal would not have minded it if service	had not gone to pieces.	4.47172184607604
10748. the girls seemed to spend half their time tiptoeing	in to see if mike was all right and they were too preoccupied	to cook much less be secretaries.	4.915310033488304
10749. even rock-steady anne- hell	anne was the worst! absent-minded subject to unexplained tears	h jubal would have bet his life that if anne were to witness the	second coming she would memorize date time personae events and	barometric pressure without batting her calm blue eyes.	3.237732632182959
10750. the expense and time involved are astronomical.	6.496310105545101
10751. however we sent a third	vessel out a much smaller and faster one than the first two.	4.323300373630684
10752. we	have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago;	that is all i can tell you about them.	5.0998800356302265
10753. but the third ship	came back several years ago and reported h   that it	had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already	inhabited by sentient beings! said hal forgetting in his enthusiasm	that he had not been asked to speak.	3.6462635415195375
10754. macneff stopped	pacing to stare at hal with his pale blue eyes.	5.739974350684024
10755. how did you	know?	9.743373093203028
10756.  he said sharply.	13.575177224286971
10757. forgive me sandalphon	said hal.	6.162967476035402
10758. but it was inevitable! did not the forerunner predict	in his time and the world line that such a planet would be found?	6.429124119835479
10759. 	i believe it was on page 573!   macneff smiled and	said i am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression.	3.6270527399328176
10760. how could they not?	11.487939505100815
10761.  thought hal.	8.12896173865557
10762. besides they	were not the only impressions.	9.717608932762548
10763. i still bear scars on my back where	pornsen my gapt whipped me because i had not learned my lessons	well enough.	3.7834635632046316
10764. he was a good impresser that pornsen.	10.424188658879723
10765. was?	10.144513917544229
10766.  is!	as i	grew older and was promoted so was he always where i was.	5.448482501884564
10767. he was	my gapt in the creche.	5.475289483739853
10768. he was the dormitory gapt when i went	to college and thought i was getting away from him.	6.001410281898431
10769. he is now my block	gapt.	7.974417128337922
10770. he is the one responsible for my getting such low m	r's.	8.013791470709858
10771. swiftly came the revulsion the protest.	5.219666477665999
10772. no not	he for i and i alone am responsible for whatever happens to me.	5.755469585402549
10773. if i get a low m r i do so because i want it that way or	my dark self does.	3.920816854246188
10774. if i die i die because i willed it so.	7.122245858039809
10775. so forgive	me sigmen for the contrary-to-reality thoughts!   please	pardon me again sandalphon said hal.	4.329360966470345
10776. but did the expedition	find any records of the forerunner having been on this planet?	5.615386258459169
10777. 	perhaps even though this is too much to wish find the forerunner	himself?	4.681180590585775
10778.    no said macneff.	11.954633045689725
10779. though that does	not mean that there may not be such records there.	5.196891301170218
10780. the expedition	was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return	to earth.	5.598795517682694
10781. i can't tell you now the distance in lightyears or what	star this was though you can see it with the naked eye at night in	this hemisphere.	3.787111795295849
10782. if you volunteer you will be told where you're going	after the ship leaves.	6.857133259359711
10783. and it leaves very soon.	7.615649912416735
10784. you	need a linguist?	9.52328749892442
10785.  said hal.	10.328204514229137
10786. the ship is huge said	macneff but the number of military men and specialists we are taking	limits the linguists to one.	5.287360009392114
10787. we have considered several of your	professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion.	4.514594966207853
10788. unfortunately	h   hal waited: macneff paced some more frowning.	6.412214371980113
10789. then he said unfortunately only one lamechian linguist	exists and he is too old for this expedition.	4.842040488132053
10790. therefore h	a thousand pardons said hal.	7.984010831499942
10791. but i have just thought	of one thing.	7.664182564167024
10792. no problem at all	said macneff.	8.98760341334402
10793. there will be no women aboard the gabriel.	6.9813748557786255
10794. and	if a man is married he will automatically be given a divorce.	6.820886369624489
10795. hal gasped and he said a divorce?	5.9336029475669045
10796.    macneff raised	his hands apologetically and said you are horrified of course.	5.739974350684024
10797. but from our reading of the western talmud we urielites	believe that the forerunner knowing this situation would arise made	reference to and provision for divorce.	3.90288109031425
10798. it's inevitable in this case	for the couple will be separated for at the least forty years.	5.295948006802271
10799. naturally	he couched the provision in obscure language.	4.913686410369733
10800. in his great	and glorious wisdom he knew that our enemies the israelites must not	be able to read therein what we planned.	5.616173271502874
10801. tell me more sandalphon.	6.285361928709408
10802. six months later	hal yarrow stood in the observation dome of the gabriel and	watched the ball of earth dwindle above him.	5.25199249800423
10803. it was night on this hemisphere	but the light blazed from the megalopolises of australia	japan china southeast asia india siberia.	3.823013384827574
10804. hal the linguist	saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken	therein.	6.354053255140259
10805. australia the philippine islands japan and northern	china were inhabited by those members of the haijac union that spoke	american.	4.114940150066115
10806. southern china all of southeast asia southern	india and ceylon these states of the malay federation spoke bazaar.	5.168218950028093
10807. his mind turned the globe	swiftly for him and he visualized africa which used swahili south	of the sahara sea.	4.115945972669574
10808. all around the mediterranean sea asia minor	northern india and tibet hebrew was the native tongue.	5.6250219159548935
10809. in	southern europe between the israeli republics and the icelandic-speaking	peoples of northern europe was a thin but long stretch of territory	called march.	3.5033994744337345
10810. this was no man's land disputed by the haijac	union and the israeli republic a potential source of war for	the last two hundred years.	5.18012416143002
10811. neither nation would give up their claim	on it yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second	apocalyptic war.	4.166193676293316
10812. so for all practical purposes it was an independent	nation and by now had its own organized government	.	6.279354424300771
10813. its citizens spoke all of the world's surviving	tongues plus a new one called lingo a pidgin whose vocabulary	was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could	be contained on half a sheet of paper.	3.626578280997007
10814. hal saw in his mind	the rest of earth: iceland greenland the caribbean islands	and the eastern half of south america.	4.920292053327142
10815. here the peoples spoke the tongue	of iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the hawaiian-americans	who were busy resettling north america and the western	half of south america after the apocalyptic war.	3.6082328557650483
10816. then	there was north america where american was the native speech of all	except the twenty descendants of french-canadians living on the hudson	bay preserve.	4.758972536424235
10817. hal knew that when that side of earth	rotated into the night zone sigmen city would blaze out into space.	3.5853166747464886
10818. and somewhere in that enormous light was his apartment.	6.542342898737207
10819. but mary	would soon no longer be living there for she would be notified in a	few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to	tahiti.	3.5903783660372373
10820. she would weep in private he was sure for she loved him	in her frigid way though in public she would be dry-eyed.	5.174344581624225
10821. her friends	and professional associates would sympathize with her not because she	had lost a beloved husband but because she had been married to a man	who thought unrealistically.	3.635657973152986
10822. if hal yarrow had been killed in a	crash he must have wanted it that way.	5.982581921875386
10823. there was no such thing as an	accident.	7.964948712844442
10824. somehow all the other passengers	have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance	had simultaneously agreed	to die.	5.320250587734403
10825. and therefore being in disgrace they would not be cremated	and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony.	4.190971440020588
10826. no the fish	could eat their bodies for all the sturch cared.	7.016744106905955
10827. hal felt	sorry for mary; he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his	own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome.	3.6754442527015745
10828. yet	he told himself this was the best way.	8.29477628576098
10829. he and mary would no longer	have to tear and rend at each other; their mutual torture would be	over.	3.8876176564316083
10830. mary was free to marry again not knowing that the sturch had	secretly given her a divorce thinking that death had dissolved her	marriage.	5.003706510511288
10831. she would have a year in which to make up her mind to choose	a mate from a list selected by her gapt.	4.3606783939385085
10832. perhaps the psychological	barriers that had prevented her from conceiving hal's child would	no longer be present.	5.918735114070151
10833. hal doubted if this happy event	would occur.	4.913686410369733
10834. mary was as frozen below the navel as he.	6.600355114825724
10835. no matter who	the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt h   the	gapt.	4.981908321888693
10836. he would no longer have to see that fat face hear	that whining voice h   hal yarrow! said the whining	voice.	5.944303282164653
10837. and slowly feeling himself icy yet burning hal turned.	4.767272111599635
10838. there was the squat loose-jowled man smiling lopsidedly	up at him.	7.687641452798602
10839. my beloved ward my perennial gadfly said the	whining voice.	4.947900054435123
10840. i had no idea that you too would be on this glorious	voyage.	6.696707239534826
10841. but i might have known! we seem to be bound by love;	sigmen himself must have foreseen it.	4.728364372470293
10842. love to you my ward.	7.858233612521448
10843. sigmen love you too my guardian said hal choking.	4.477601198394805
10844. how	wonderful to see your cherished self.	7.163184125958424
10845. i had thought we would never	again speak to each other.	5.1352263303997345
10846. the gabriel pointed	towards her destination and under one-gee acceleration began to build	up towards her ultimate velocity 99.	4.705010556909502
10847. 1 percent of the speed of light.	6.805810837648096
10848. meanwhile all the personnel except those few needed to carry out	the performance of the ship went into the suspensor.	5.524953918534414
10849. here they would	lie in suspended animation for many years.	5.453398566442511
10850. some time later after	a check had been made of all automatic equipment the crew would join	the others.	6.031460672049385
10851. they would sleep while the gabriel's drive would increase	the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel	could not have endured.	3.924728310837345
10852. upon reaching the desired speed the	automatic equipment would cut off the drive and the silent but not empty	vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journey's end.	4.803496496934009
10853. many years later the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of	the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration.	3.9770183642601427
10854. again a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure	would be applied.	6.197563654280718
10855. then after slowing the vessel considerably the drive	would adjust to a one-gee deceleration.	4.299253217127944
10856. and the crew would be automatically	brought out of their suspended animation.	7.351825264556057
10857. these members would	then unthaw the rest of the personnel.	5.824080551782354
10858. and in the half-year left	before reaching their destination the men would carry out whatever	preparations were needed.	6.183075319270925
10859. hal yarrow was among the last to go	into the suspensor and among the first to come out.	4.278773991256712
10860. he had to study	the recordings of the language of the chief nation of ozagen siddo.	7.374975699996135
10861. and from the first he faced a difficult task.	5.981016710856245
10862. the expedition that	had discovered ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand siddo	words with an equal number of american words.	4.834582869683347
10863. the description of	the siddo syntax was very restricted.	4.1174608023645085
10864. and as hal found out obviously	mistaken in many cases.	7.335901867840535
10865. this discovery caused hal anxiety.	5.840583368462051
10866. his duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel	of the gabriel how to speak ozagen.	5.473751096318714
10867. yet if he used all of the	little means at his disposal he would be instructing his students	wrongly.	4.282559594924938
10868. moreover even getting this across would be difficult.	7.4120268440856085
10869. for one thing the organs of speech of the ozagen natives differed	somewhat from earthmen's; the sounds made by these organs were	therefore dissimilar.	4.028045291393381
10870. it was true that they could be approximated	but would the ozagenians understand these approximations?	6.572209506836773
10871.    another	obstacle was the grammatical construction of siddo.	4.913686410369733
10872. instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached	particle to indicate the past or future siddo used an entirely different	word.	5.5574871446897545
10873. thus the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai	meaning to live was in the perfect tense ksu'u'peli'afo	and in the future mai'teipa.	4.905104315580726
10874. the same use of	an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses.	6.592026581768586
10875. plus the	fact that siddo not only had the normal three genders	of masculine feminine and neuter but the two extra of inanimate and	spiritual.	3.467766426174774
10876. fortunately gender was inflected though the expression	of it would be difficult for anybody not born in siddo.	6.028799799179272
10877. the system	of indicating gender varied according to tense.	4.1174608023645085
10878. all the other	parts of speech: nouns pronouns adjectives adverbs and conjunctions	operated under the same system as the verbs.	5.593814347699732
10879. this was not for the angel just a matter of running through a logical	or deductive chain or deciding on some action from some already	established premise.	4.21308195084364
10880. no doubt the angels could do that kind of thing	as fast as any computer.	6.74988155460848
10881. what gabriel was being asked to do	now however was to re-examine all his basic assumptions make value-judgments	on them and give them new and different powers in his mind	to govern his motives.	3.443841830284351
10882. this is not wholly a reasoning process- a computer	cannot do it all- and even in an angel it takes time.	5.961511296302191
10883. perhaps especially in an angel whose assumptions had mostly been	being reasonably sure of the	reason for the long pause however did not make it seem any less long	to jack.	3.5543443876642336
10884. he had already become used to hesperus' snapping back answers	to questions almost before jack could get them asked.	5.597962870867727
10885. there	was nothing he could do but wait.	5.706666639655636
10886. at	last gabriel spoke.	9.52328749892442
10887. we misjudged you he said slowly.	5.905279144285114
10888. we had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had	time to develop a sense of justice.	6.270880442538147
10889. of course we have before us the	example of the great races at the galactic center; individually they	are nearly as mortal as you- the difference does not seem very marked	to us where it exists.	3.7424381310258887
10890. but they have survived for long periods as	races whereas you are young.	7.192040660411285
10891. we shall recommend to them that	they shorten your trial period by half.	4.636282053879951
10892. for now it is clear	that we were in the wrong.	7.480389953638222
10893. you may reclaim your property and the	penalty on hesperus is lifted.	4.935642891633628
10894. i	did not perceive this essential distinction either first-born	hesperus said at once i was only practicing a concept that jack	taught me called a deal.	4.8866846590170505
10895. nevertheless you were its	agent.	7.459806268060902
10896. jack what is the nature of this concept?	8.788581880573728
10897.    it's	a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other	jack said.	3.8849121559715263
10898. we regard it as fair only when each party feels	that what he has received is as valuable or more valuable than what	he has given.	4.883452538181372
10899. his heart he discovered was pounding.	5.606913684254195
10900. for	instance hesperus agreed to help me find my property and i agreed	to take him to earth.	5.445588126142635
10901. between individuals this process is called	bargaining.	5.590376626423384
10902. when it is done between races or nations it is called	making a treaty.	7.164796115275666
10903. and the major part of my mission to your nest is to	make a treaty between your race and mine.	4.162772078668702
10904. recovering the property was	much less important.	7.163184125958424
10905. and	apparently impossible.	8.12896173865557
10906. though it might be that we would have much to	give you you have nothing to give us.	6.881760317291868
10907. hesperus and lucifer	jack said show that we do.	4.6724501027054846
10908. another pause;	but this one was not nearly as long.	7.463568290731982
10909. then it is a matter of	pleasure; of curiosity; of a more alive time.	6.150943653440084
10910. yes those could	be commodities under this concept.	7.842532404401056
10911. but you should understand jack	that hesperus and lucifer are not long out of the nursery.	4.835158489908137
10912. visiting	the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older.	6.996045062105817
10913. this explained a great deal.	5.840583368462051
10914. all the more reason	then jack said why we must have a treaty.	8.086892516743934
10915. we will gladly entertain	your young and give them proper living quarters in return for	their help in running our fusion reactors.	3.963906131552174
10916. but we must know if this	is in accordance with your customs and must have your agreement they	will not misuse the power we put in their hands to our hurt.	5.1607039261891
10917. but this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the	dictates of their own natures and respect yours in turn.	4.468440605640043
10918. to this	we	of course agree.	9.687987091481455
10919. jack felt a wave of complete elation but	in a second it had vanished without a trace.	3.9540895539524756
10920. what gabriel was asking	was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments and contract	to let the angels serve on earth as it is in heaven regardless	of the applicable earth laws.	5.29979720460497
10921. the angels in turn would exercise	similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures	of the earthmen- but they had no faintest notion of man's perverse	habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own	preferences and violations of his nature.	3.240078880634123
10922. the simple treaty principle	that gabriel was asking him to ratify in short was nothing	less than total trust.	5.306453255173471
10923. and it might	be considering the uncomfortable custom the angels had of thinking	of everything in terms of absolutes that the proposal of anything less	might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war.	3.693279546187251
10924. furthermore even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of	jack's total make-up could not understand how the principle could	ever be codified.	5.164805548097799
10925. almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward	suspicion not trust as the safest and sanest attitude toward all	outsiders.	3.894159841892531
10926. yet there was some precedent for it.	8.22726704140187
10927. the history of	disarmament agreements for instance had been unreassuringly dismal;	but the united states and the union of soviet socialist republics	nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban and	a sort of provisional acceptance of each other's good intentions on	this limited question.	3.5338115012672016
10928. out of that agreement though not by any easy	road eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the united nations;	suspicion between member states still existed but it was of	about the same low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry	between arizona and california over water supplies.	5.063921258307109
10929. besides	agreements in principle with the petty details to be thrashed	out later were commonplace in diplomatic history.	3.744109221929566
10930. the trouble with	them was that they almost never worked and in fact an agreement in	principle historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither	party really wanted the quarrel settled.	5.313784630704096
10931. suppose that this one	were to work?	5.869934143289326
10932.  there was no question in jack's mind of the good	faith on one side at least.	7.2595800158483295
10933. if mankind could be convinced of that h	it was worth trying.	4.620959352609645
10934. in fact it had to be tried.	10.979636888691413
10935. it would	be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that earth had	ever signed.	4.4094688342635715
10936. secretary hart had taught jack at least partially to	be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters; but there	was no small way to handle this one.	4.936905965229293
10937. he turned back to the	screens the crucial conclusive phrase on his lips.	4.4199766848814255
10938. but he was too late.	11.41260737127725
10939. he had lost his audience.	7.1019842115352665
10940. for a moment he could make no	sense at all of what he saw.	7.87223920909387
10941. it seemed to be only a riot of color light	and meaningless activity.	5.763427667847185
10942. gradually he realized that the pentagon	of angel elders had vanished and that the ritual learning dance of	the nursery had been broken up.	5.485185372782355
10943. the angels in the nursery were zigzagging	wildly in all directions seemingly at random.	3.782281192301135
10944. hesperus!	what's going on here?	8.457718703298294
10945.  what's happened?	8.12896173865557
10946.    your	brothers have been found.	8.457718703298294
10947. they are on their way here.	6.888782569556046
10948. where?	13.921774766768346
10949.  i don't see them.	7.028761150033486
10950. the instruments don't show them.	6.5153514259002465
10951. you can't see them yet jack.	6.665878949531619
10952. they'll be in range	in a short while.	6.743273855772659
10953. jack scanned the skies the boards and	the skies again.	4.522676510826158
10954. no- there was a tiny pip on the radar;	and it was getting bigger rapidly.	6.272784895127963
10955. if that was the skiff it was making	unprecedented speed.	5.931928827726204
10956. then the skiff hove into sight just	a dot of light at first against the roiling blackness and crimson streaks	of the coal sack.	5.217417284468112
10957. through the telescope jack could see that	both spacesuits were still attached to it.	4.424879891706073
10958. the sail was still unfurled	though there were a good many holes in it as langer had predicted	would be the case by now.	4.785643797490687
10959. it was a startling almost numenous	sight; but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an	enormous comet's-tail of angels.	5.0736463739887565
10960. the skiff was not heading	for the nursery however.	5.650577481330174
10961. it seemed unlikely that her crew if either	of them were alive could even see the ariadne for they were passing	her at a distance of nearly a light-year.	3.598110590037152
10962. and there would be no	chance of signaling them- without the nernst generator jack could	not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static and by	the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone.	5.013340532235335
10963. fuming helpless he watched them pass him.	4.913686410369733
10964. the sail ragged	though it was still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of	power being poured out from the nursery stars.	5.205641135163438
10965. he would never have believed	without seeing it that the bizarre little vessel could go so	fast.	4.632969748724832
10966. but where was it going?	9.572669960049895
10967.  and why was it causing so much	agitation among the angels and being followed by so many of them?	4.404442223582066
10968. 	there was only one possible answer but jack's horrified	mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar plots of the skiff's	course into the computer.	4.8249012478655615
10969. the curve on the card the computer	spat back at him couldn't be argued with however.	3.5177069743400518
10970. the skiff	was headed for the very center of the nebula- toward that place which	jack knew now could hold nothing less important than the very core	of the angel's life and religion.	5.012037386463353
10971. it was clear that langer	had at last found a way to attract the angel's attention.	4.979319068664586
10972. it was equally clear that as of this moment the treaty was off.	5.942286085934111
10973. langer would have to be headed off whether	he knew where he was going or not.	5.498507049025819
10974. almost surely he did; after all	he had had the same set of facts as jack had had to work from and	he was an almost frighteningly observant man.	4.797675008455874
10975. but not having talked	to the angels he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along	the line.	4.352374034762116
10976. had he decided perhaps that the center of the cloud	was	a center of government instead of a center of life and faith?	6.262874974108568
10977. 	but it didn't matter now whether he meant to invade the holy	of holies or was simply headed in that direction by accident.	3.6372358363595825
10978. if	it was intentional it was now also unnecessary; and whether intentional	or not the outcome would be disastrous.	5.082994548584995
10979. jack crawled under	the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had excised from	the nernst generator switch.	3.6056725349656924
10980. when he was back on his feet again	and about to reinstall the fuses however he hesitated.	6.42995553288736
10981. he had	to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff and he had to have	it fast.	4.8200361925625215
10982. but fusion power in the coal sack was what had triggered	all the trouble in the first place- and he already had an angel aboard.	5.617814832312682
10983. i'm	going to turn my generator back on as i promised to do.	4.0683852436856025
10984. but i can't	take you to earth yet.	8.475715773816484
10985. first i've got to intercept my brothers	before they get any deeper into trouble.	4.411889500806633
10986. will you obstruct this	or will you help?	8.071270383521435
10987.  i know it's not part of the bargain and your	elders might not like it.	5.1511085460856965
10988. nobody else can live in your	hearth while i am in it hesperus said promptly.	5.768060612141409
10989. as for my elders	they have already admitted that they were wrong.	5.58836301480413
10990. if because of	this incident they become angry with earth i will not be permitted	to go there at all.	5.973712749234066
10991. therefore of course i will help.	6.678113408012134
10992. with	a short-lived sigh of relief jack plugged the fuses back in and threw	the switch.	5.331440467598945
10993. without an instant's transition the green light that	meant full fusion power winked on the board.	4.106073488928998
10994. always before it had	taken five minutes to-   of course.	6.215762647990194
10995. from	here on out the ariadne was going to be hotter than any space	cruiser man had ever dreamed of.	4.267321338853143
10996. but since he had failed to	anticipate it he lost the five minutes anyhow in plotting an intercept	orbit.	5.740032649248995
10997. hesperus don't use this t-tau vector	trick of yours please.	4.477601198394805
10998. ryan hefted his bulk up and supported it on one elbow.	5.739974350684024
10999. he rubbed	his eyes sleepily with one huge paw.	4.862373123883983
11000. ekstrohm nogol you guys	okay?	8.457718703298294
11001.    nothing wrong with me that couldn't be cured	nogol said.	5.388406532282757
11002. he didn't say what would cure him; he had been	explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself.	5.2612367141013205
11003. his small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face.	4.20107693337999
11004. well let's	take a ground-level look at the country around here.	8.162841824957653
11005. the facsiport rolled open on the landscape.	4.280553672808819
11006. a range of bluffs	hugged the horizon the color of decaying moss.	6.406470585703537
11007. above them the sky	was the black of space or the almost equal black of the winter sky above	minneapolis seen against neon-lit snow.	3.8156998737792738
11008. that cold empty sky was	full of fire and light.	6.940935020433001
11009. it seemed almost a magnification of the galaxy	itself of the milky way blown up by some master photographer.	4.045958385265516
11010. this fiery swath was actually only a belt of minor planets	almost like the asteroid belt in the original solar system.	5.321808700729047
11011. these	planets were much bigger nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere.	4.182602481535312
11012. but to the infuriation of scientists for no known reason not all of	them did.	6.490398072213987
11013. this would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids	of yancy-6 in three generations.	4.963072267104369
11014. they lay months away from the nearest	earth star by jump drive and no one knew what they were good for	although it was felt that they would probably be good for something	if it could only be discovered- much like the continent of antarctica	in ancient history.	5.169802105366233
11015. how can a planet with so many neighbors	be so lonely?	5.244174669626431
11016.  ryan asked.	11.155741451300253
11017. he was the captain so he could	ask questions like that.	5.58022995552113
11018. some can be lonely in a crowd	nogol said elaborately.	6.667120517548874
11019. what will we need outside ryan?	6.086995205672239
11020. 	ekstrohm asked.	11.155741451300253
11021. no helmets the captain answered.	6.549083679307419
11022. we can breathe out there all right.	8.468790176946525
11023. it just won't be easy.	6.699712588745633
11024. this old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago.	5.9942891758332175
11025. nitrogen	and oxygen are about it.	5.619635421798327
11026. ryan look over there	nogol said.	7.712079578137997
11027. think they're intelligent	maybe hostile?	6.785506835031044
11028.    i think they're dead ekstrohm	interjected quietly.	9.317758002168013
11029. i get no readings from them at all.	5.097275438242154
11030. sonic	electronic galvanic- all blank.	8.457718703298294
11031. according to these needles they're	stone dead.	6.414905961034911
11032. ekstrohm you and i will have a look	ryan said.	8.248113787331466
11033. you hold down the fort nogol.	6.489597984021554
11034. easy nogol confirmed.	9.7745889261295
11035. i heard a story once about	a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldn't	get an encephalographic reading on him.	3.5932633295793535
11036. me i know the mind	of an officer works in a strange and unfathomable manner.	5.659921213504063
11037. i'm	not worried about you mis-reading the dials nogol just about	a lug like you reading them at all.	3.685338251241182
11038. remember when the little hand	is straight up that's negative.	6.629800120365015
11039. positive results start when it goes	towards the hand you use to make your mark.	3.9505551665960614
11040. ryan told him what he could do then.	7.3605351485364885
11041. ekstrohm	smiled and followed the captain through the airlock with only	a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall.	3.7293365891118424
11042. the strong negative field	his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects.	4.938093575452413
11043. actually	the types of infection that could attack a warm-blooded mammal	were not infinite and over the course of the last few hundred years	adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories.	3.8896223280450037
11044. he wasn't	likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever.	5.752586250134144
11045. they ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and with only	a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance dropped	to the ground.	3.8309177541513972
11046. it was day but in the thin atmosphere contrasts	were sharp between light and shadow.	6.743984583883027
11047. they walked from midnight	to noon noon to midnight and came to the beast sprawled on its side.	4.40724434835756
11048. ekstrohm nudged it with a boot.	8.393535890625678
11049. hey this is pretty close	to a wart-hog.	4.913686410369733
11050. one of the	best matches i've ever found.	8.70975407263994
11051. well it has to happen.	8.251963508653093
11052. still it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to	find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world.	5.644955136233424
11053. it makes	you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some big joke and	somebody has been everywhere before you even started.	3.7843549609798974
11054. the	surveyor looked sidewise at the captain.	7.163184125958424
11055. the big man seldom	gave out with such thoughts.	4.609091761261654
11056. what shall	we do with this one?	8.356620097469762
11057.  dissect it?	8.12896173865557
11058.    ryan nudged it with	his toe following ekstrohm's example.	6.412214371980113
11059. it sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species	to me.	4.492216360467276
11060. no hands for one thing.	8.98760341334402
11061. of course that's not definite	proof.	7.138761752623229
11062. no it isn't ekstrohm said.	8.98760341334402
11063. i	think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological	setup around here.	4.252095873980644
11064. in the meantime we might be thinking on	the problem all these dead beasts represent.	6.184029112491886
11065. what killed them?	8.648285665039051
11066. 	it looks like we did when we made blastdown.	6.144814417540349
11067. but	what about our landing was lethal to the creatures?	4.477601198394805
11068. 	radiation?	13.921774766768346
11069.  ekstrohm suggested.	8.12896173865557
11070. the planet is very low	in radiation from mineral deposits and the atmosphere seems to shield	out most of the solar output.	5.243138642245368
11071. any little dose of radiation might knock	off these critters.	5.150327193119337
11072. i don't know about that.	9.590492422970046
11073. maybe	it would work the other way.	5.219666477665999
11074. maybe because they have had virtually	no radioactive exposure and don't have any r's stored up they	could take a lot without harm.	5.554416611697191
11075. then maybe it was the	shockwave we set up.	5.14970347049455
11076. or maybe it's sheer xenophobia.	9.205825560719608
11077. they curl	up and die at the sight of something strange and alien- like a spaceship.	3.9789745378525514
11078. at this stage	of the game anything could be possible.	7.633898497523723
11079. but there's one possibility	i particularly don't like.	5.350857324489514
11080. and that is?	13.39878430475845
11081. 	suppose it was not us	that killed these aliens.	5.671679140501753
11082. suppose it is something	right on the planet native to it.	6.782485574288748
11083. i just hope it doesn't work	on earthmen too.	5.615253055697938
11084. these critters went real sudden.	8.456729966590668
11085. ekstrohm	lay in his bunk and thought the camp is quiet.	4.317068102383446
11086. the	earthmen made camp outside the spaceship.	7.163184125958424
11087. there was no reason to leave	the comfortable quarters inside the ship except that faced with	a possibility of sleeping on solid ground they simply had to get out.	3.9585881440847515
11088. the camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles ringed with a spy	web to alert the earthmen to the approach of any being.	4.648562495918306
11089. each	man had a bubble to himself privacy after the long period of enforced	intimacy on board the ship.	3.882467541040623
11090. ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened	to the sounds of the night on yancey-6 138.	5.922637728014715
11091. there was a keening	of wind and a cracking of the frozen ground.	5.163302551553838
11092. insects there were on	the world but they were frozen solid during the night only to revive	and thaw in the morning sun.	5.272307777738916
11093. the bunk he lay on was much more	uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board.	3.570845587849075
11094. yet he knew the	others were sleeping more soundly now that they had renewed their	contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high	vacuum.	5.187784281621091
11095. now there could be an	end to pretending.	6.391086895058291
11096. he threw off the light blanket and swung	his feet off the bunk to the floor.	5.704232249841836
11097. there	was no longer any need to hide.	5.629769458489715
11098. but what was there to do?	9.017976936439684
11099.  what had	changed for him?	7.472149566047476
11100.    he no longer had to lie in his bunk all night	his eyes closed pretending to sleep.	5.386537616393464
11101. in privacy he could walk	around leave the light on read.	4.527932529475728
11102. it was small comfort for insomnia.	8.302831016987879
11103. some doctors had informed him he	was mistaken about this.	4.858195022782949
11104. actually they said he did sleep but so shortly	and fitfully that he forgot.	6.0543090943325035
11105. others admitted he was absolutely	correct- he never slept.	5.618268537444317
11106. his body processes only slowed down enough	for him to dispell fatigue poisons.	5.765327675605419
11107. occasionally he fell into a	waking gritty-eyed stupor; but he never slept.	4.576892544881611
11108. naturally he couldn't let his shipmates know this.	7.163834605007746
11109. insomnia	would ground him from the exploration service on physiological	if not psychological grounds.	4.367554397987657
11110. he had to hide it.	11.763478435130327
11111. over the	years he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could confide.	4.419312498008882
11112. the buddies invariably took advantage of him.	5.8743971957932475
11113. since he couldn't	sleep anyway he might as well stand their watches for them or write	their reports.	4.224911416219169
11114. where the hell did he get off threatening to report	any laxness on their part to the captain?	5.833686074872184
11115.  a man with insomnia had	better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him.	4.129864642203191
11116. ekstrohm had to hide his secret.	7.163184125958424
11117. in a camp instead of	shipboard hiding the secret was easier.	4.962556853522588
11118. but the secret itself was	just as hard.	7.842053810801052
11119. ekstrohm picked up a lightweight no-back from the	ship's library a book by bloch the famous twentieth century expert	on sex.	3.6687044422994064
11120. he scanned a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated	nineteenth century sex murderer but he couldn't seem to concentrate	on the weighty pontifical ponderous style.	4.818455105175782
11121. on impulse	he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the	hatch of the bubble.	4.023106403997707
11122. ekstrohm walked through the alien glass	and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations smelling the frozen sterility	of the thin air.	5.422612741502433
11123. behind him his mates stirred without	waking.	5.582840197578082
11124. ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a	banging on the hatch of his bubble.	5.880963261091984
11125. it took him a few seconds to put	his thoughts in order and then he got up from the bunk where he had been	resting sleeplessly.	4.147433302354059
11126. the angry burnt-red face of ryan greeted	him.	5.8743971957932475
11127. okay stormy this isn't the place for fun and games.	4.317068102383446
11128. what did you do with them?	8.98872169182486
11129.    do with what?	9.455913203044535
11130. 	the dead beasties.	9.52328749892442
11131. all the dead animals laying around the ship.	5.770578288821917
11132. what are you talking about ryan?	9.17927326047237
11133.  what do you think i	did with them?	7.13681545611375
11134.    i don't know.	11.067037043475061
11135. all i know is that they	are gone.	5.576164450004199
11136. gone?	13.921774766768346
11137.    ekstrohm shouldered	his way outside and scanned the veldt.	4.6724501027054846
11138. there was no ring of animal	corpses.	9.922120798982213
11139. nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen	breeze.	5.233350162740743
11140. i'll be damned ekstrohm said.	7.712079578137997
11141. you	are right now buddy.	6.162967476035402
11142. expe doesn't like anybody mucking up primary	evidence.	6.743273855772659
11143. where do you get off ryan?	6.358925011065238
11144.  ekstrohm	demanded.	13.921774766768346
11145. why pick me for your patsy?	6.238836969946059
11146.  this has got to be some	kind of local phenomenon.	7.398045773812033
11147. why accuse a shipmate of being behind this?	5.421199734113007
11148. 	listen ekstrohm i want to give you the benefit of	every doubt.	6.770897532683242
11149. but you aren't exactly the model of a surveyor you know.	4.732472540197324
11150. you've been riding on a pink ticket for six years you know that.	5.621513124847952
11151. no ekstrohm said no i didn't know that.	5.240816707323618
11152. you've been hiding things from me and nogol every jump	we've made with you.	5.448482501884564
11153. now comes this! it fits the pattern of secrecy	and stealth you've been involved in.	4.542276341844555
11154. what could i	do with your lousy dead bodies?	7.569852880939487
11155.  what would i want with them?	6.37850240914288
11156. 	all i know is that you were outside the bubbles last night	and you were the only sentient being who came in or out of our alarm	web.	4.872597147972173
11157. now all the bodies are missing like they	got up and walked away.	4.449874174091614
11158. it was not a new experience to ekstrohm.	9.042092282526438
11159. suspicion wasn't new to him at all.	5.339887605038384
11160. ryan	there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies.	5.9245075971793435
11161. look	for them will you?	6.162967476035402
11162.  i give you my word i'm not trying to pull	some stupid kind of joke or to deliberately foul up the expedition.	5.01442883908466
11163. take my word can't you?	6.667974168220305
11164.    ryan shook his head.	8.457718703298294
11165. i don't	think i can.	7.028761150033486
11166. there's still such a thing as mental illness.	6.412214371980113
11167. you	may not be responsible.	6.592724375387955
11168. don't	try anything violent stormy.	8.457718703298294
11169. i outweigh you fifty pounds and	i'm fast for a big man.	4.627381420290268
11170. i wasn't planning on jumping	you.	8.667966011188964
11171. why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong?	6.6133261473969505
11172. 	she lived and was given a name.	6.743273855772659
11173. for her first three vegetable	months she waved her crabbed claws kicked weakly with her clubbed	feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant.	3.5686719021407605
11174. she was not alone	for there were three other such children in the big city's special	nursery.	7.012075073678421
11175. soon they all were removed to central laboratory school	where their delicate transformation began.	4.450891890217946
11176. one of the babies	died in the initial transferral but of helva's class seventeen	thrived in the metal shells.	5.703441298538829
11177. instead of kicking feet helva's	neural responses started her wheels; instead of grabbing with hands	she manipulated mechanical extensions.	4.082240479506626
11178. as she matured more and more	neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went	into the maintenance and running of a space ship.	5.107742782954506
11179. for helva was	destined to be the brain half of a scout ship partnered with a	man or a woman whichever she chose as the mobile half.	3.8794732220309727
11180. she would be	among the elite of her kind.	7.340428258487744
11181. her initial intelligence tests registered	above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high.	4.304706645661433
11182. as long	as her development within her shell lived up to expectations and there	were no side-effects from the pituitary tinkering helva would live	a rewarding rich and unusual life a far cry from what she would have	faced as an ordinary normal being.	4.584754197505525
11183. however no diagram	of her brain patterns no early iq tests recorded certain essential	facts about helva that central must eventually learn.	3.7733749296776273
11184. they	would have to bide their official time and see trusting that the massive	doses of shell-psychology would suffice her too as the necessary	bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession.	4.432830191042747
11185. a ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with	the power and resources central had to build into their scout ships.	3.3611829048066157
11186. brain ships were of course long past the experimental stages.	6.166654237516118
11187. most	babes survived the techniques of pituitary manipulation that kept	their bodies small eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller	to larger shells.	3.9614418092356236
11188. and very very few were lost when the final connection	was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine.	5.494651208728659
11189. shell	people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities	were but the well-oriented brain would not have changed places	with the most perfect body in the universe.	3.5246948579754576
11190. so for happy years	helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates playing such	games as stall power-seek studying her lessons in trajectory	propulsion techniques computation logistics mental hygiene basic	alien psychology philology space history law traffic codes: all	the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning logical	informed citizen.	4.356516033055021
11191. not so obvious to her but of more importance	to her teachers helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as	easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid.	3.706584749355911
11192. she would one day be grateful	to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction.	6.19079828340085
11193. helva's civilization was not without busy do-good associations	exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial as well as extraterrestrial	citizens.	4.49522562805009
11194. one such group got all incensed over shelled children	when helva was just turning fourteen.	6.0388207924269155
11195. when they were forced	to central worlds shrugged its shoulders arranged a tour of the laboratory	schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the	members case histories complete with photographs.	4.123501801844954
11196. very few committees	ever looked past the first few photos.	7.910106372718166
11197. most of their original objections	about shells were overridden by the relief that these hideous	bodies were mercifully concealed.	4.440996663119588
11198. helva's	class was doing fine arts a selective subject in her crowded program.	5.583228874976599
11199. she had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later	use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel.	4.131228772427647
11200. her	subject	was large- a copy of the last supper- and her canvas small-	the head of a tiny screw.	6.005564195882277
11201. she had tuned her sight to the proper	degree.	5.691655381666232
11202. as she worked she absentmindedly crooned producing a curious	sound.	7.4428996641657035
11203. shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound	issued through microphones rather than mouths.	3.744109221929566
11204. helva's hum then	had a curious vibrancy a warm dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic	wanderings.	5.364451129419534
11205. why what a lovely voice you have	said one of the female visitors.	5.914070603103725
11206. helva looked up and caught	a fascinating panorama of regular dirty craters on a flaky pink surface.	5.138210239895059
11207. her hum became a gurgle of surprise.	5.568027332225555
11208. she instinctively regulated	her sight until the skin lost its cratered look and the pores	assumed normal proportions.	5.442661456391538
11209. yes we have quite a few years	of voice training madam remarked helva calmly.	4.888531941436244
11210. vocal peculiarities	often become excessively irritating during prolonged intra-stellar	distances and must be eliminated.	6.0950077274252665
11211. although this was the first time that helva had seen unshelled	people she took this experience calmly.	5.595586492972886
11212. any other reaction would have	been reported instantly.	7.661608826855371
11213. i meant that you have a nice singing	voice h dear the lady amended.	5.1567735423312735
11214. would	you like to see my work?	8.060590095765823
11215.  helva asked politely.	6.939425769494729
11216. she instinctively	sheered away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away	for further meditation.	5.6835767868554585
11217. i am currently reproducing the last supper on the head of a screw.	5.418369796320536
11218. o i say the lady twittered.	8.805299370419938
11219. helva turned	her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically.	4.182602481535312
11220. of course some of my color values do not match the old master's	and the perspective is faulty but i believe it to be a fair	copy.	6.447197034040905
11221. the lady's eyes unmagnified bugged out.	4.484814815711922
11222. oh i forget and helva's voice was really contrite.	6.779153466524398
11223. if she	could have blushed she would have.	5.629025250720429
11224. you people don't have adjustable	vision.	10.23187799197865
11225. the monitor of this discourse grinned with pride	and amusement as helva's tone indicated pity for the unfortunate.	3.428445430010395
11226. here this will help suggested helva substituting	a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture.	5.839273156472795
11227. in a kind of shock the ladies and gentlemen of the committee	bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed last	supper on the head of a screw.	4.245935769810911
11228. well remarked one gentleman	who had been forced to accompany his wife the good lord can	eat where angels fear to tread.	5.4217831966663494
11229. are you referring sir	asked helva politely to the dark age discussions of the number	of angels who could stand on the head of a pin?	4.2843772704950895
11230.    i had	that in mind.	9.645886477709713
11231. if you substitute 'atom' for 'angel'	the problem is not insoluble given the metallic content of the	pin in question.	4.172568131086358
11232. which you are programed to compute?	8.187017088929611
11233. 	of course.	8.12896173865557
11234. did they remember to program a	sense of humor as well young lady?	6.185563510589704
11235.    we are directed	to develop a sense of proportion sir which contributes the same effect.	5.041594029270364
11236. the good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip	was worth his time.	5.354241021234345
11237. if the investigation committee spent months	digesting the thoughtful food served them at the laboratory school	they left helva with a morsel as well.	3.9143477319589377
11238. singing as	applicable to herself required research.	7.163184125958424
11239. she had of course been exposed	to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the	better known classical works such as tristan und isolde candide	oklahoma nozze de figaro the atomic age singers	eileen farrell elvis presley and geraldine todd as well	as the curious rhythmic progressions of the venusians capellan visual	chromatics and the sonic concerti of the altairians.	3.179764819577731
11240. but singing	for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties	to be overcome.	6.110193592166714
11241. shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of	a problem or situation before making a prognosis.	3.8330064472745713
11242. balanced properly	between optimism and practicality the nondefeatist attitude of the shell	people led them to extricate themselves their ships and personnel	from bizarre situations.	5.190990055207007
11243. therefore to helva the problem that she	couldn't open her mouth to sing among other restrictions did not	bother her.	3.8163373800112947
11244. she would work out a method by-passing her limitations	whereby she could sing.	6.60748848357391
11245. she approached the problem by investigating	the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries human and	instrumental.	4.087278527532691
11246. her own sound production equipment was essentially more	instrumental than vocal.	6.525920315448164
11247. breath control and the proper enunciation	of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most	development and practice.	3.5853166747464886
11248. shell people did not strictly speaking breathe.	6.849773963633832
11249. for their purposes oxygen and other gases were not drawn from	the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained	artificially by solution in their shells.	3.556439567913485
11250. after experimentation helva	discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain	tone.	6.336794254807127
11251. by relaxing the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity	well into the frontal sinuses she could direct the vowel sounds into	the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat	microphone.	3.3921926934106876
11252. she compared the results with tape recordings of modern	singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar	quality about them not at all unharmonious merely unique.	5.0732948591922
11253. acquiring	a repertoire from the laboratory library was no problem to one trained	to perfect recall.	3.8849121559715263
11254. she found herself able to sing any role and any	song which struck her fancy.	5.795202652536122
11255. it would not have occurred to her that	it was curious for a female to sing bass baritone tenor alto mezzo	soprano and coloratura as she pleased.	4.185802164332107
11256. it was to helva only a matter	of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the	music attempted.	5.91827184387032
11257. if the authorities remarked on her curious	avocation they did so among themselves.	4.516248824591444
11258. shell people were encouraged	to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical	work.	5.967372782154558
11259. on the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her	shell helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship	the xh-834.	3.9858087527843464
11260. her permanent titanium shell was recessed behind an	even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship.	5.448049750070308
11261. the neural audio visual and sensory connections were made and	sealed.	3.873635296338494
11262. her extendibles were diverted connected or augmented and the	final delicate-beyond-description brain taps were completed while helva	remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings.	5.199340774820401
11263. when she awoke	she was the ship.	6.741106092009044
11264. her brain and intelligence controlled every	function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class	needed.	5.306903281864007
11265. she could take care of herself and her ambulatory half in any	situation already recorded in the annals of central worlds and any	situation its most fertile minds could imagine.	3.6860338470152625
11266. her first actual	flight for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels	since she was eight showed her complete mastery of the techniques	of her profession.	4.931569803719322
11267. she was ready for her great adventures and the arrival	of her mobile partner.	4.741246151359012
11268. there were nine qualified scouts sitting	around collecting base pay the day helva was commissioned.	6.1151764979809435
11269. there	were several missions which demanded instant attention but helva	had been of interest to several department heads in central for some	time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section.	3.3329165033145483
11270. consequently no one had remembered to introduce helva to the prospective	partners.	5.969745338124765
11271. the ship always chose its own partner.	4.64685421318426
11272. had there	been another brain ship at the base at the moment helva would	have been guided to make the first move.	6.449163543998997
11273. as it was while central wrangled	among itself robert tanner sneaked out of the pilots' barracks	out to the field and over to helva's slim metal hull.	4.73539612667617
11274. hello anyone at home?	8.457718703298294
11275.  tanner wisecracked.	8.12896173865557
11276. of course	replied helva logically activating her outside scanners.	7.60412561198855
11277. are	you my partner?	7.49515687550504
11278.  she asked hopefully as she recognized the	scout service uniform.	7.036985271744727
11279. all you have to do is ask he retorted	hopefully.	6.891716731147346
11280. i thought perhaps there	were no partners available and i've had no directives from central.	5.802993724615812
11281. even to herself helva sounded a little self-pitying but	the truth was she was lonely sitting on the darkened field.	4.070023470371114
11282. always	she had had the company of other shells and more recently technicians	by the score.	5.701189980308826
11283. the sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and	become oppressive.	3.873635296338494
11284. no directives from central is scarcely	a cause for regret but there happen to be eight other guys biting their	fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you	you beautiful thing.	4.729483058503622
11285. it would have killed you in the cabin.	6.991327338041437
11286. do you have anything for me?	10.34543695156148
11287. 	mercer stammered not knowing what b'dikkat meant and	the two-nosed man answered for him i think he has a nice baby head	but it isn't big enough for you to take yet.	3.5559484238890957
11288. mercer never	noticed the needle touch his arm.	6.743273855772659
11289. b'dikkat had turned to	the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit mercer.	3.9701983041559052
11290. he tried to run after b'dikkat to hug the lead spacesuit to tell	b'dikkat that he loved him.	5.504477227080864
11291. he stumbled and fell but it did not	hurt.	5.456206630887215
11292. the many-bodied girl lay near him.	6.154713990487742
11293. isn't it wonderful?	7.166356872681305
11294.  you're beautiful beautiful beautiful.	8.457718703298294
11295. i'm so happy to be here.	5.219666477665999
11296. the woman covered with	growing hands came and sat beside them.	5.315754005455559
11297. she radiated warmth and good	fellowship.	6.386493532495508
11298. mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming.	6.144814417540349
11299. he struggled out of his clothes.	6.257206127506011
11300. it was foolish and snobbish	to wear clothing when none of these nice people did.	6.1311085389843285
11301. the two	women babbled and crooned at him.	4.280553672808819
11302. with one corner of his mind	he knew that they were saying nothing just expressing the euphoria of	a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it.	5.262020699237417
11303. with most	of his mind he was happy.	5.6696019761531655
11304. he wondered how anyone could have the good	luck to visit a planet as nice as this.	5.41073507423388
11305. he tried to tell the lady	da but the words weren't quite straight.	4.667264386176413
11306. a painful stab	hit him in the abdomen.	7.77090105846889
11307. the drug went after the pain and swallowed it.	4.547164939100171
11308. it was like the cap in the hospital only a thousand times better.	6.228999718339868
11309. the pain was gone though it had been crippling the first time.	4.236440574357304
11310. he forced himself to be deliberate.	7.955092672187658
11311. he rammed his mind into focus	and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert	that was a good bite.	3.905593915917448
11312. maybe i will grow another head.	8.282443705220766
11313. that	would make b'dikkat happy!   the lady da forced the foremost	of her bodies in an upright position.	3.744109221929566
11314. said she i'm strong	too.	10.117100543823403
11315. remember man remember.	8.003181967841924
11316. we can die too we can die like real people.	7.08596726053589
11317. i do so believe	in death!   mercer smiled at her through his happiness.	4.791480496739908
11318. but isn't this nice h   with	this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack.	5.384813102752371
11319. he was wide awake	but he did not feel like doing anything.	5.433054831637183
11320. in that beautiful place	among all those companionable and attractive people he sat and smiled.	5.991004839467826
11321. b'dikkat was sterilizing his knives.	5.619635421798327
11322. mercer wondered	how long the super-condamine had lasted him.	6.412214371980113
11323. he endured the ministrations	of the dromozoa without screams or movement.	4.467047448170571
11324. the agonies of nerves	and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near	him but meant nothing.	4.762804453309085
11325. he watched his own body with remote casual	interest.	4.862373123883983
11326. the lady da and the hand-covered woman stayed near him.	5.315929595247935
11327. after	a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his	powerful arms.	4.4109025131301545
11328. having arrived he blinked sleepily and friendlily at	them and lapsed back into the restful stupor from which he had emerged.	5.888959928773136
11329. mercer saw the sun rise on occasion closed his eyes briefly and	opened them to see stars shining.	3.685338251241182
11330. the dromozoa	fed him in their mysterious way; the drug canceled out his needs for	cycles of the body.	4.705010556909502
11331. at last he noticed a return of the inwardness	of pain.	5.859695617217239
11332. the pains themselves had not changed; he had.	5.650533918541493
11333. he knew all the events which could take place on shayol.	4.663472907427931
11334. he	remembered them well from his happy period.	6.743273855772659
11335. formerly he had noticed	them- now he felt them.	4.6724501027054846
11336. he tried to ask the lady da how long	they had had the drug and how much longer they would have to wait	before they had it again.	5.384629757167296
11337. she smiled at him with benign remote happiness;	apparently her many torsos stretched out along the ground had	a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body.	3.4536315565375904
11338. she meant	him well but was in no condition for articulate speech.	6.197871288603115
11339. the	half-man lay on the ground arteries pulsating prettily behind the	half-transparent film which protected his abdominal cavity.	4.113314421054342
11340. mercer	squeezed the man's shoulder.	8.457718703298294
11341. the half-man woke recognized	mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin.	3.902827513177379
11342. 'a good	morrow to you my boy'.	7.163184125958424
11343. that's out of a play.	7.156542813996534
11344. did you ever see	a play?	8.849111051933006
11345.    you mean a game with cards?	6.489597984021554
11346.    no	said the half-man a sort of eye-machine with real people doing	the figures.	6.33831319617407
11347. i never saw that said mercer but	i-   but you want to ask me when b'dikkat is going	to come back with the needle.	4.369926819610512
11348. yes said mercer a little	ashamed of his obviousness.	7.36424277221314
11349. that's why i think of plays.	5.313810338281711
11350. we all know what is going to happen.	9.227316332540163
11351. we all know when it is going to happen.	7.186420402663086
11352. we all know what the dummies	will do- he gestured at the hummocks in which the decorticated	men were cradled- and we all know what the new people will ask.	5.428412677192394
11353. but we never know how long a scene is going to take.	5.546688272977873
11354. what's	a 'scene'?	11.155741451300253
11355.  asked mercer.	10.229970983316296
11356. is that the name for the	needle?	11.534564387514774
11357.    the half-man laughed with something close to real	humor.	4.1174608023645085
11358. you've got the lovelies on the brain.	6.842336078405939
11359. a	scene is just a part of a play.	6.9095736800851775
11360. i mean we know the order in which things	happen but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days	or to make calendars and there's not much climate here so none of	us know how long anything takes.	4.836342644773983
11361. the pain seems short and the pleasure	seems long.	4.2706617925696
11362. i'm inclined to think that they are about two earth-weeks	each.	7.746838657314885
11363. mercer did not know what an earth-week	was since he had not been a well-read man before his conviction but	he got nothing more from the half-man at that time.	3.6913126773392366
11364. the half-man received	a dromozootic implant turned red in the face shouted senselessly	at mercer take it out you fool! take it out of me!	when mercer looked on helplessly the half-man twisted over on	his side his pink dusty back turned to mercer and wept hoarsely and	quietly to himself.	4.349785557014559
11365. mercer himself could not tell how long it	was before b'dikkat came back.	4.0683852436856025
11366. it might have been several days.	11.500739796486567
11367. it might have been several months.	8.380355010914688
11368. once again b'dikkat moved	among them like a father; once again they clustered like children.	6.116645157603168
11369. this time b'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had	grown out of mercer's thigh- a sleeping child's head covered	with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes.	3.418825085942393
11370. mercer got the blissful needle.	7.712079578137997
11371. when b'dikkat cut the head	from mercer's thigh he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage	which held the head	to his own body.	3.716212850671366
11372. he saw the child-face grimace	as the head was cut; he felt the far cool flash of unimportant pain	as b'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which	stopped all bleeding immediately.	4.823095434541282
11373. the next time it was two legs	growing from his chest.	4.628127450893064
11374. then there had been another head beside	his own.	9.324128161597347
11375. or was that after the torso and legs waist to toe-tips	of the little girl which had grown from his side?	3.8505751200878215
11376.    he	forgot the order.	9.52328749892442
11377. he did not count time.	7.946500561346033
11378. lady da smiled	at him often but there was no love in this place.	6.439843545158463
11379. she had lost	the extra torsos.	7.310830366244789
11380. in between teratologies she was a pretty and shapely	woman; but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper	to him repeated some thousands of time repeated with smiles and	hope people never live forever.	4.68740882851635
11381. she found this immensely	comforting even though mercer did not make much sense out of it.	4.123447570691935
11382. thus events occurred and victims changed in appearance and	new ones arrived.	6.364325071817825
11383. sometimes b'dikkat took the new ones resting in	the everlasting sleep of their burned-out brains in a ground-truck	to be added to other herds.	3.673722684025607
11384. the bodies in the truck threshed and bawled	without human speech when the dromozoa struck them.	4.827508206929211
11385. finally	mercer did manage to follow b'dikkat to the door of the cabin.	4.158551149063809
11386. he	had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it.	6.3726281277575465
11387. only the memory	of previous hurt bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if	he did not ask b'dikkat when he mercer was happy the answer would	no longer be available when he needed it.	3.4770882262713183
11388. fighting pleasure itself	he begged b'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long	he had been there.	5.2123799449913895
11389. b'dikkat grudgingly agreed but he did not	come out of the doorway.	5.406067649709339
11390. he spoke through the public address box built	into the cabin and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain	so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their	happiness and wondered what their friend b'dikkat might be wanting	to tell them.	4.4343227639750955
11391. when he said it they thought it exceedingly profound	though none of them understood it since it was simply the amount of time	that mercer had been on shayol:   standard years- eighty-four	years seven months three days two hours eleven and one	half minutes.	3.796915046983164
11392. mercer turned away.	9.52328749892442
11393. the secret little corner of his mind which stayed sane through happiness	and pain made him wonder about b'dikkat.	3.390533004331794
11394. what persuaded the	cow-man to remain on shayol?	7.907021291394379
11395.  what kept him happy without super-condamine?	6.089298979665242
11396. 	was b'dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a	man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day surrounded	by a family of little cow-people resembling himself?	4.830259482309519
11397.  mercer despite	his happiness wept a little at the strange fate of b'dikkat.	4.248349546580317
11398. his	own fate he accepted.	8.457718703298294
11399. he remembered the last time he had eaten-	actual eggs from an actual pan.	4.253379751714175
11400. the dromozoa kept him alive	but he did not know how they did it.	6.32781522400636
11401. he staggered back to the	group.	5.926245264679889
11402. the lady da naked in the dusty plain waved a hospitable hand	and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her.	5.423079461596008
11403. there	were unclaimed square miles of seating space around them but he appreciated	the kindliness of her gesture none the less.	3.7694277144788466
11404. the years if they were years went by.	6.716948644679927
11405. the land of shayol did not	change.	5.2483468520293926
11406. sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across	the plain to the herd of men; those who could talk declared it	to be the breathing of captain alvarez.	4.903742904274166
11407. there was night and day but	no setting of crops no change of	season no generations of men.	4.249858272232944
11408. time	stood still for these people and their load of pleasure was so commingled	with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the	lady da took on very remote meaning.	4.7088301117657805
11409. her statement was a hope not a truth in which they	could believe.	4.521404284375445
11410. they did not have the wit to follow the stars in their	courses to exchange names with each other to harvest the experience	of each for the wisdom of all.	6.297346632127973
11411. there was no dream of escape for these	people.	6.129993328089794
11412. though they saw the old-style chemical rockets lift up from	the field beyond b'dikkat's cabin they did not make plans to hide	among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh.	5.182230831743048
11413. far long ago some	other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter.	4.961624471904791
11414. his	handwriting was on a rock.	8.18861689384065
11415. mercer read it and so had a few of the others	but they could not tell which man had done it.	3.9590424106730575
11416. the letter scraped on stone had been a message home.	6.241646794011023
11417. they	could still read the opening: once i was like you stepping	out of my window at the end of day and letting the winds blow me gently	toward the place i lived in.	3.557796273904296
11418. once like you i had one head two	hands ten fingers on my hands.	6.252889836917529
11419. the front part of my head was called	a face and i could talk with it.	3.6796282816015924
11420. now i can only write and that only	when i get out of pain.	6.52012576032138
11421. dan morgan told himself he would forget ann turner.	4.5168057313601855
11422. he	was well rid of her.	7.811977069529017
11423. he certainly didn't want a wife who was fickle	as ann.	4.640144727336761
11424. if he had married her he'd have been asking for trouble.	7.594576204488201
11425. but all of this was rationalization.	7.3784585951638535
11426. sometimes he woke up in	the middle of the night thinking of ann and then could not get back	to sleep.	6.017145843574957
11427. his plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for	so long that now he felt as if he had nothing.	4.010500798425293
11428. the easiest thing would	be to sell out to al budd and leave the country but there was	a stubborn streak in him that wouldn't allow it.	4.495700404544252
11429. the best antidote	for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard	work.	4.135099714916697
11430. he found that if he was tired enough at night he went to sleep	simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake.	6.177571312253335
11431. each day he found	himself thinking less often of ann; each day the hurt was a little	duller a little less poignant.	3.7439689138601655
11432. he had plenty of work to do.	8.575037909349176
11433. because the summer was unusually dry and hot the spring produced a	smaller stream than in ordinary years.	4.205850997392218
11434. the grass in the meadows came	fast now that the warm weather was here.	5.196735619842704
11435. he could not afford to lose	a drop of the precious water so he spent most of his waking hours along	the ditches in his meadows.	3.976796839625486
11436. he had no idea how much time	budd would give him.	7.593390940087857
11437. in any case he had no intention of being caught	asleep so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he	took his winchester with him and leaned it against the fence.	3.764785490089643
11438. he stopped	every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon	but nothing happened each day dragging out with monotonous calm.	4.798359079296209
11439. when in late afternoon on the last day in june he saw two	people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house he quit work	immediately and strode to his rifle.	3.8098845846479814
11440. it could be some kind of trick	budd had thought up.	8.640324877856932
11441. no one walked in this country least of all	ed dow or dutch renfro or any of the rest of the bar b crew.	5.089851944609223
11442. morgan watched the two figures for a time puzzled.	6.882047509171301
11443. when they were closer	and he saw that one was a woman he was more puzzled than ever.	4.509676833736735
11444. he cleaned his shovel left it against the fence picked up his	winchester and started downstream.	5.362099888262211
11445. his visitors had crawled through	the south fence and were crossing the meadow angling toward the house.	3.8414869378748526
11446. now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly	staggering as if they found it a struggle to remain on their	feet.	5.858534748442744
11447. reaching the house ahead of them he waited with his	winchester in his hands.	4.003617793566638
11448. they crawled through the north fence and came	on toward him and now he saw that both were young not more than nineteen	or twenty.	5.227535342329546
11449. they were dirty their clothes were torn and the	girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from	the front door.	3.8604829557653337
11450. she lay there making no effort to get back on her	feet.	6.5891359300720875
11451. the boy came on to the porch and sat down his gaze on morgan	as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring.	3.4807901148428835
11452. morgan	hesitated thinking that if this was a trick it was a good one.	7.639383296261716
11453. he	didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending.	4.346399406047479
11454. the	boy licked his dry lips.	7.712079578137997
11455. he asked could we have a drink?	6.608969145608185
11456. 	morgan jerked his head toward the front door.	6.412214371980113
11457. in the kitchen	he said.	7.118364988167366
11458. leaning his winchester against the front of the house	he walked to the girl.	6.728910382955875
11459. there's water in the house.	5.619635421798327
11460. she didn't move or say anything.	8.037204458577536
11461. her eyes were glazed as if	she didn't hear or even see him.	4.433524796184818
11462. she had reached a point at which	she didn't even care how she looked.	6.262754524751296
11463. her face was very thin and burned	by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling the new	skin under it red and angry.	3.87645929321613
11464. her blond hair was frowzy her dress	torn in several places and her shoes were so completely worn out	that they were practically no protection.	4.960460519096153
11465. it must have hurt her even	to walk for the sole was completely off her left foot and morgan saw	that it was bruised and bleeding.	3.9954185569660314
11466. he picked her up sliding one	hand under her shoulders the other under her knees and carried her	into the house.	5.120965546354313
11467. she was amazingly light and so relaxed in his arms	that he wasn't even sure she was conscious.	4.092680996987446
11468. any lingering suspicion	that this was a trick al budd had thought up was dispelled.	6.246375736791947
11469. no girl	would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him.	4.193893543694493
11470. besides she	had a sweet face that attracted him.	7.157625823765312
11471. he put her down on the	couch and going into the kitchen saw that the boy had dropped into a	chair beside the table.	3.608534404324019
11472. they looked a good deal alike morgan thought.	8.28651308551085
11473. both had blonde hair and blue eyes and there was even a faint similarity	of features.	4.784243925966317
11474. morgan filled the dipper from the water	bucket on the shelf went back into the front room lifted the girl's	head and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth.	5.074804380919321
11475. she drank greedily	and murmured thank you as he lowered her head.	4.516262660452241
11476. he	stood looking down at her for a moment wondering what could have reduced	her to this condition.	6.004943554095593
11477. he had seen a few nester wagons go through	the country the families almost starving to death but he had never	seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two.	3.7462166056173873
11478. the girl	dropped off to sleep.	6.5155523300336915
11479. morgan returned to the kitchen built a fire	and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured	into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove.	3.864181072048348
11480. he brought	his winchester in from the front of the house then faced the boy.	8.237776353464012
11481. who are you and what happened to you?	6.1354497055357875
11482.  he asked.	12.081077223713681
11483. i'm billy jones the boy answered.	5.219666477665999
11484. we ran out of money and we haven't eaten for two days.	6.209023757585054
11485. what are you doing here?	7.402479863932699
11486.    are we in wyoming?	11.852408300834295
11487. 	morgan nodded.	8.12896173865557
11488. about five miles north of the line.	9.290868524132105
11489. jones sighed as if relieved.	6.426275213109736
11490. we've been looking for work	but all the ranchers have turned us down.	5.708861896459012
11491. you mean you	dragged your wife all over hell's half-acre looking for work?	4.661562062821843
11492. 	morgan demanded.	11.155741451300253
11493. the town of buckhorn's only about six miles	from here.	4.133056826538741
11494. why didn't you go there?	9.40240925036724
11495.    we didn't want	town work jones said.	5.905279144285114
11496. this is a mighty empty country	morgan said.	8.558660592139264
11497. there's only one more ranch three miles north	of here.	4.477601198394805
11498. you'd have starved to death if you'd missed both places.	6.016033156719718
11499. then we're lucky we got here.	5.86580759755904
11500. could you give us a	job mr h   morgan.	7.162248422760354
11501. he was	silent a moment thinking he could use a man this time of year and if	the girl could cook it would give him more time in the meadows but	he knew nothing about the couple.	3.6639458041231396
11502. they might kill him in his sleep thinking	there was money in the house.	6.838449579678172
11503. he dismissed the possibility at	once.	5.926245264679889
11504. the girl's thin face haunted him.	6.154713990487742
11505. it wasn't the face of a	killer.	7.414474187442413
11506. he wasn't so sure about the boy.	7.042834174643505
11507. he hadn't shaved for several	weeks his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic woebegone expression.	3.9072530517863884
11508. there was more to this than jones had told him.	7.098099742632683
11509. they	were running from something.	6.680616313978654
11510. he'd be an idiot to let them stay	he thought but he couldn't send them on either.	5.402275746091342
11511. i could	use some help morgan said finally but i can't afford to pay	you anything.	4.219767238009599
11512. i guess you'd better go on in the morning.	7.294399601190684
11513. we'll work for our keep the boy said eagerly.	4.604283900009467
11514. i've been	mucking in a mine in the san juan but i used to work on a ranch.	5.8340711446560185
11515. sharon she's cooked in a restaurant.	5.219666477665999
11516. we'll work hard mr morgan.	8.208754806593541
11517. right now you need	a meal and a bath.	4.931420323902755
11518. your wife's in terrible shape.	9.014682318496321
11519. i	know jones said dejectedly.	6.162967476035402
11520. morgan filled the fire box	with wood again then started supper and set the table.	5.657498318791368
11521. when the meal	was ready he told jones to wash up and going into the front room	woke the girl.	3.9828077342164376
11522. he said i've got some supper ready.	8.449761677617253
11523. she	rubbed her eyes and stretched then sat up her hands going to her	hair.	3.9701983041559052
11524. i'm a mess she said and suddenly she was alarmed.	6.001945332540827
11525. who	are you?	8.12896173865557
11526.  how did we get here?	10.041645859530227
11527.    i'm dan morgan.	6.939425769494729
11528. this is the rafter m.	10.31030502413524
11529. you fell down in front of the house	and i carried you in.	5.686280101099153
11530. i gave you a drink and then you went to sleep.	6.29797476500134
11531. she stared at him her eyes wide as she thought	about what he had said; then she murmured: you're very kind	mr morgan.	3.6685058945383573
11532. do you take in all the strays who come by?	8.109188400481921
11533. 	i don't have many strays coming to my front door he said.	4.0683852436856025
11534. think you can walk to the table?	8.012878886245064
11535.    of course.	11.431877912431707
11536. she got to her feet staggered and almost fell.	6.711985643380859
11537. he caught her	by an arm and helped her into the kitchen.	4.318068015596563
11538. she sat down at the table	shaking her head.	8.01351760578784
11539. i'm usually a	very strong woman but i'm awfully tired.	4.477601198394805
11540. it's not much of a meal but it's what	i eat.	6.776073468028735
11541. not much of a meal?	7.284581295164594
11542.  the girl cried.	7.667068388245458
11543. mr	morgan it's the best-looking food i ever saw.	4.6724501027054846
11544. he	told himself he had never seen two people eat so much.	6.64989162525138
11545. when they were	finally satisfied jones said i think he's going to give us work.	4.512507288087149
11546. the grateful way she looked at morgan made him ashamed	of himself.	5.187735111958531
11547. when he saw the expression in her eyes he knew he couldn't	send them on.	5.211599458388984
11548. she said i guess the lord looks out for fools	drunkards and innocents.	6.448204849712703
11549. which are	you?	10.1649012669817

11569. you'd better sleep.	6.939425769494729
11570. jones followed	him into the front room closing the door behind him.	6.221006562082965
11571. he said: if	it's all right with you mr morgan i'll sleep out here	on the couch.	3.9072530517863884
11572. we haven't slept together since we started.	7.543900632520252
11573. i just	can't take any chances on getting her pregnant and if we were sleeping	together h   he stopped embarrassed and morgan said	i understand that but i don't savvy why you'd go off and leave	your jobs in the first place.	3.515694996703876

11579. you can't	make me go.	8.09303208031044
11580. gavin sank down again into his chair and began	to rock.	5.9245075971793435
11581. he was thinking of rittenhouse and how he had left him	there to rock to death on the porch of the splendide.	4.047263156995177
11582. it was the only	thing in his life for which he felt guilt.	7.215040118980488
11583. beneath his black shirt	his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat the	stored pain shattering free in slow gasps terrible to see.	3.4590108242550226
11584. clayton	tried to call back the face of the man he had known.	7.619944408933071
11585. against that other	man he could rally his anger; against this bent man in the chair	he was powerless.	4.247724978289087
11586. gavin's lips moved so that clayton had	to stoop to catch the words.	5.583228874976599
11587. do you remember big charlie?	7.370881820424821
11588.  he	whispered.	13.921774766768346

11596. they just all cleared out.	8.451230752941052
11597. i treated	them fair h	he wiped his lips with a sleeve then stared	at clayton in a childish kind of wonder.	3.753051578545724
11598. do you mean- he	asked almost shyly- you want me to go with you wherever you're	goin?	6.711731777270688

11601. 	clayton choked shook his head murmuring no.	4.913686410369733
11602. the old man beckoned with one finger and clayton	went forward to him.	5.602816377668298
11603. gavin slipped his arms around his chest and	hugged him fiercely.	4.317068102383446
11604. all my life he said i tried.	8.150144289298485
11605. i saw you driftin away- but i tried.	5.613331681499464

11608. laurel is gone my men are gone ed is dead- and you come to me to	help me.	5.3438327381017166
11609. oh! god in heaven i can't refuse you now.	4.477601198394805
11610. that would	mock me too much! can't let you go way from me again h he	closed his eyes ashamed of his tears.	5.122309423541344
11611. clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back.	4.477601198394805
11612. the	eyes followed him fearfully.	8.457718703298294
11613. i'll saddle the horses and bring them round.	4.831680191124786
11614. he burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold	night air.	6.172331632851325
11615. gavin's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches	over the saddle blanket working by touch in the darkness comforting	the animal with easy words.	3.6677616802025437
11616. when he had finished he led him and	the mare to the porch.	7.261294548827495
11617. the stallion had smelled the mare coming into	heat and began to paw the turf shaking his head.	3.6186333630561056
11618. clayton looped the	reins in a	knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his	neck.	5.138210239895059
11619. the mare had backed away.	4.747750369463677
11620. you take it easy boy clayton	whispered.	9.269027303482275
11621. she doesn't want you now.	6.6120759348089315
11622. you take it easy your time	will come.	8.523609942601873
11623. gavin stood on the porch a thin figure.	5.586747627641978
11624. he	had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand	the stock bumping on the wood floor.	5.373296138897454
11625. clayton called to him and he came	slowly down the steps.	5.229545715971076
11626. clay he said where are we	goin?	7.288802638621865
11627.    to a ranch in the valley.	6.399325708681165
11628. there's someone there	i have to see.	7.163184125958424
11629. we may take her with us- to california.	5.592902396245217
11630. i don't	know yet it's crazy; i have to think about it.	7.8600208063954105
11631. but california	is where we're goin.	6.236627984188189
11632. that's a new land.	8.649137887461364
11633. a man could make a mark there.	5.7180973280509715
11634. two men	together like us we could do somethin fine out there maybe find a	place where no one's ever been.	5.2504134305084555
11635. start out fresh the two of us like	nothin had ever happened.	4.657478779427823
11636. yes like a father and son.	8.849819789672415
11637. i made you what you are gavin whispered.	5.591395122433186
11638. i made	you so you could stand up.	7.419762506052198
11639. i made you a man.	6.316170410054584
11640. he approached the horse and laid a hand on the	stallion's quivering neck.	6.252323401470552
11641. help me up i	feel kind of stiff.	4.913686410369733
11642. clayton lifted him gently into the saddle like	a child.	6.144814417540349
11643. i hate to leave my garden gavin said.	5.381385780844744
11644. i loved my garden.	9.645886477709713
11645. it will grow again-	in california.	7.573080397284836
11646. i loved this valley he whispered	huskily.	7.95751090267089
11647. lived alone here for three years before any man came.	4.498666029993166
11648. lived	alone by the river.	8.457718703298294
11649. it was nice then so peaceful and quiet.	5.347309543747532
11650. there	was no one but me.	9.388710890061677
11651. i don't want to leave it.	6.433567643088214
11652. clayton	swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion's rump.	6.144814417540349
11653. the two horses	broke from the yard from the circle of light cast by the lamp still	burning in the house into the darkness.	3.9324616680602493
11654. they	rode at a measured pace through the valley.	6.412214371980113
11655. dawn would come soon	and the night was at its coldest.	4.604950856818746
11656. the moon had sunk below the black crest	of the mountains and the land seen through eyes that had grown accustomed	to the absence of light looked primeval as if no man had ever	trespassed before.	4.523760606739199
11657. it looked as gavin had first seen it years ago	on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly	to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon's	wind- a savage land untenanted and brooding too strong to be	broken by the will of men.	3.2680028003429435
11658. in that inert landscape	the caravan of his desires passed before his mind.	6.36608489645782
11659. he saw them	ambushed strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying.	4.236687912185908
11660. in vain	his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had	sought so desperately but they would not come to life.	5.2082880510958685
11661. the silence oppressed	him made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide	from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through	the darkness in its slow search.	3.217173214870477
11662. they passed ranches that	were framed dark gray against the black hills.	6.0639976778550295
11663. then at last the darkness	began to dissolve.	5.674312088518517
11664. a bold line of violet broke loose from the	high ridge of the mountains followed by feathers of red that swept the	last stars from the sky.	4.677718008734699
11665. the wan light spread over the ground and the	valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences	and palely shadowed gullies.	3.7791403639905883
11666. they had been seen as soon	as they left the ranch picked out of the darkness by the weary though	watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless	shelter of the trees.	5.488013935564733
11667. the two men whipped their horses into town	and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon crying their intelligence.	3.6906945157976323
11668. the men in pettigrew's were tired from a night's	drinking their faces red and baggy.	5.751477924415088
11669. but the liquor had flushed their	courage.	6.162756863364229
11670. they greeted the news angrily as though they had been cheated	of purpose.	7.381863263043504
11671. lester heard their muttering saw their eyes reveal their	desire.	4.5168057313601855
11672. he worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his	cheek and his voice came out of his throat dry and cracked.	5.394784130629654
11673. that's what you wanted isn't it?	5.219666477665999
11674.  clayton is with	him takin him out of the valley.	8.080463003448635
11675. you can't-   keep out	of this purvis snarled.	5.990448704034849
11676. he's not your brother he's gavin's	son.	7.163184125958424
11677. you see he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone.	6.24426606791112
11678. joe purvis was thinking back many years.	6.822096012590981
11679. first he thought of	the time he had ridden to gavin and told him how his cattle were being	rustled at the far end of the valley.	4.02770649339766
11680. he remembered gavin's smirk	his own cringing feeling his impotence.	6.375016808455901
11681. then he thought of a time	when clayton's horse had fallen lame in the gap.	4.988984203721021
11682. his wife had	said to him: nellie is in love with clayton roy.	5.876204478785725
11683. he wouldn't	even dance with her at gavin's party.	4.862373123883983
11684. he treats her like she was	dirt.	7.579652630610537
11685. and you stand by like a fool and let him do it h   he	remembered clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked	him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water.	3.6070102565060345
11686. it was	the night clayton had tricked them in the poker game.	7.568843112282866
11687. you're gavin's	son joe purvis had said.	5.219666477665999
11688. you brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find	your boy.	6.017718203415214
11689. he meant to help gavin all the time.	5.0739102710962
11690. he made a fool of	you lester.	9.386634750462028
11691. he swung round to the other men- we can catch	him easy! there are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place.	4.038100544146958
11692. if	we let them go they won't stay away they'll find men to ride with	them and they'll be back.	5.109044461121069
11693. there's only one way they can get out	now and that's through the gap- if we ride hard we can take them.	3.6506806980885105
11694. lester's hand fluttered to cabot's shoulder.	7.163184125958424
11695. he killed tom- do you understand that?	5.211015548613603
11696. 	cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they	would do wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the	cold of the ebbing night.	5.269349328533109
11697. he fled through the door and down the steps	running and the men grunted and followed pushing lester to one	side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised	before his eyes to shut out the light.	3.3706547796475785
11698. purvis and silas pettigrew	were the last to leave.	6.869017205229474
11699. they mounted up and rode slowly behind the	others at a safe distance.	4.28332056006509
11700. in the cold dawn	the mist swirled low to the ground then rose with a gust of sudden wind	to leave the valley clear.	5.620012291926101
11701. the clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight	swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold	light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams	over the dazzling snow.	3.269555516193143
11702. when they turned in the saddle they could	see the men behind them strung out on the prairie in a flat black line.	5.757508326362688
11703. the wind of their running was cold and wild the horses were lathered	and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind.	3.266812985229425
11704. the mare began to tire and clayton felt the spray of snow from	the hoofs of gavin's stallion.	4.705010556909502
11705. he looked over his shoulder at the	thin dotting of pursuers.	4.466678468812241
11706. they neither gained nor fell back.	7.7782111142395784
11707. he rode	low on the mare's neck.	5.475289483739853
11708. ahead of him gavin turned slightly off the	trail and pointed for the gap no more than a mile away.	6.02633016187636
11709. gavin's	face was bloodless with excitement.	5.619635421798327
11710. he did not look back; he	could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out	across the prairie to the north.	5.291248728345189
11711. he knew who was riding after him-	the men he had known all his life the men who had worked for him sworn	their loyalty to him.	3.9612795893856063
11712. now they were riding to kill him.	9.124228511276412
11713. and he was	fleeing running- fleeing his death and his life at the same time.	5.179179470189129
11714. the land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in:	his valley.	5.079841176502993
11715. with every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he	crossed one more patch of earth that had been his that he would never	see again.	4.2483231621006565
11716. the gap looming before him- the place where had confronted	jack english on that day so many years ago- was his exit from	all that had meaning to him.	4.527666302370507
11717. california is too far he thought.	5.289832839054316
11718. he would never reach california.	9.884634510602284
11719. he was too old- when he passed	up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could	see ahead he was passing from life.	3.791353650186275
11720. the sentry was not dead.	6.5155523300336915
11721. he was in fact showing signs of	reviving.	7.678631634317637
11722. he had been carrying an enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball	pistol.	6.853836585250131
11723. a bayonet hung in a belt scabbard.	4.8523584052118895
11724. he was partially	uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat.	7.025114488421098
11725. mike stripped these from him	and donned them.	4.913686410369733
11726. he and dean tied and gagged the man using his belt	and shirt for the purpose.	5.6560003137710275
11727. they dragged him inside the building.	5.667824126156082
11728. fiske joined them unsteady on his feet.	6.743273855772659
11729. julia seeing the bandage	rushed to him.	5.219666477665999
11730. you are hurt! she breathed.	10.695400358364237
11731. i	never felt better in my life fiske blustered.	5.066288485570843
11732. he turned	to susan and kissed her on the cheek.	6.66396356910166
11733. thank you my dear	he	said.	7.1727289916781505
11734. mike silenced them.	9.52328749892442

11933. that's why the trust don't want us to	make it.	4.720783641663907
11934. that bastard chambers!- old knife's not the only	chief he'll get to do his dirty work! before we get through he'll	have the blackfeet hankerin' for our hair and our goods.	4.783668757534034
11935. well	talkin' ain't goin' to help- let's fort up!   as	i dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection i grudgingly	found myself agreeing with oso's logic especially when i imagined	what would have happened to missy if old knife's large party	of screeching warriors had overrun our company.	3.2596633210407315
11936. for unlike	the sioux and the crows the aricaras are not great horsemen nor	are they aggressive like the savage blackfeet.	5.1472981054217275
11937. more of an agricultural	nation they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for	survival in the endless wars of the plains.	3.890817306516875
11938. still i was disgusted	with myself for agreeing with montero's methods.	6.682222137597973
11939. surprisingly	he had told the others what he had done.	4.665739433227243
11940. in the brief moment i	had to talk to them before i took my post on the ring of defenses i	indicated i was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade	on the river.	4.996844255538049
11941. i think montero did right amy said firmly.	5.817223713148792
11942. let the savages kill each other what do we care?	7.121056108675443
11943. 	reverend jason was understandably bitter.	5.619635421798327
11944. it was a terrible thing	to do.	9.332062277192955
11945. but oso replied calmly	trouble ain't easy to dodge out in this country rev'rend.	4.827681091922351
11946. gray eyes attacked our camp just as the first	pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky.	5.415995673082591
11947. our camp was	in the center of a wide valley.	6.632169244094661
11948. montero had set up a strong position	using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and	brush.	5.752859169416518
11949. he had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle	and had assigned pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying	to keep them steady under fire.	3.7506579364117067
11950. the pony herd was the one	flaw in our defense; the rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as	many of the animals as possible.	4.925628885383496
11951. wildly bucking horses would make the	position difficult to defend against charging warriors.	4.0683852436856025
11952. the cooks	had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time and	on montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day.	5.880804694952003
11953. buckets	were filled the herd fed and watered.	4.913686410369733
11954. the worst part had been the	waiting; although we didn't expect the attack before dawn the long	cloudy night filled with the sounds of the industrious insects seemed	endless.	4.647920986262966
11955. coyotes and hunting wolves sounded like signaling indian	scouts the whinny of a restless pony made one's skin crawl.	3.632711015013689
11956. oso	slept unconcernedly his rifle cradled in his arms; i didn't catch	a wink.	5.583228874976599
11957. every time i closed my eyes i saw gray eyes rushing at	me with a knife.	4.31817480658413
11958. it was a relief when they finally came.	7.9938125433297
11959. they poured through the opening in the valley then spread out in	a long line to come at us brandishing their lances and filling the morning	with their spine-chilling scalp cry.	3.4022200038296764
11960. oso montero	called i'll get gray eyes.	7.163184125958424
11961. that'll be a pleasure	to see the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of	his rifle.	3.685338251241182
11962. hold your fire montero was shouting.	7.2935672544109025
11963. i'll shoot the first man who doesn't.	4.913686410369733
11964. i could see them in my sights.	9.07238172411548
11965. they were about a mile off; under	me the ground quivered slightly.	4.747311876130074
11966. at first they were only feathers	and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies hunched over their horses'	heads.	6.029064669024112
11967. gradually they emerged as men.	6.211294293715094
11968. gray eyes was in the lead.	8.993075110737694
11969. his face was split by a vermilion streak his eyes were pools of white;	jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest.	3.7365751889789274
11970. he was	naked except for a clout.	8.830833461835253
11971. next to him was a young boy i was sure	had sat near me at one of the trading sessions.	4.60928866676133
11972. his mouth was open his	neck corded with the strain of his screams.	5.764296628188913
11973. i found his chest in my	sights.	6.362595524094214
11974. it had a red circle.	11.03508799406115
11975. the circle came nearer and nearer.	4.484731839010815
11976. my god how long is he going to wait i thought h.	6.055193581888968
11977. at first i thought he had missed.	6.748415206201138
11978. the feathered lance was still above his head.	5.650577481330174
11979. as	he started to slump over another warrior swung him onto his horse.	4.090570250019937
11980. at the last second i dropped my sights	from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony.	5.44800348476124
11981. i saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its	head bouncing like a rubber ball.	4.066969137287489
11982. he started to run but oso's shot	caught him on the wing.	6.360698704308917
11983. he jerked once in the grass and lay still.	5.027087529136243
11984. if you're goin' to kill 'em- kill 'em! oso	growled.	6.893720085123536
11985. what else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire	on all sides.	5.248189339239165
11986. the aricaras broke under the devastating fire wheeled	and retreated.	5.4678654398730995
11987. lead up! lead up! they'll be back!	montero was shouting.	4.477601198394805
11988. far up the valley i could see the	rees circling and reorganizing.	6.994184303472261
11989. out in front of our walls the grass	was covered with dead and dying men war shields lances blankets and	wounded and dead horses.	4.156098629449139
11990. the morning air was filled with the sweetish	odor of new-spilled blood the acrid stench of frightened horses	and the bitterness of burned powder.	4.766159512031718
11991. a horse screamed as it twisted from	side to side in a frenzy.	4.175397377016615
11992. a rifle cracked; the square head fell	over.	6.659110663564295
11993. one of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running	across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek.	4.150116696405439
11994. his legs	pumped furiously his long black hair streamed out behind him.	6.0012383098397475
11995. there	was a ragged volley.	7.304834831056043
11996. he was dead before he hit the ground.	7.694597565994751
11997. for christ's sake don't waste your powder on one of 'em!	montero shouted furiously.	4.381458133539515
11998. wait for the charge! the charge	i tell you!   the sharp cries at the end of the valley were	faint.	5.9077917889154
11999. they grew louder as the indians charged again.	5.004446092747742
12000. i could see	their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease their mouths open	shouting their spine-chilling cries.	5.793400486973896
12001. gray eyes is back	montero said.	5.619635421798327
12002. the war captain had been badly wounded and was	fighting to hold his seat.	5.425794281632703
12003. i could see the blood running down his	chest.	6.735330990949269
12004. he was riding between two warriors who held him erect when he	started to slump.	5.8727012955973885
12005. in my sights i watched	him looming bigger and bigger.	5.212149204878738
12006. montero's shot had caught him high in	the chest; there was no doubt he was dying.	5.995672946817134
12007. again we waited for montero.	6.7655748114284275
12008. this time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted	frantically but they held their fire.	6.877318292502377
12009. the horses were only several	lengths away when he fired.	4.419440610306134
12010. the bullet flung gray eyes from his horse.	5.650533918541493
12011. our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts.	5.922164873000142
12012. but a few reached our wall.	9.499057969442191
12013. i heard the whir of an ax and a canadian's	face burst apart in a bloody spray.	4.12324065383709
12014. i saw little billy rise	and fire almost point blank and an indian's face became shattered	flesh and bone.	5.616553204045583
12015. a second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale	firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible	they were in flight.	3.9592642626339347
12016. oso reached up jerked the buck	from the bale and snapped his neck.	5.583228874976599
12017. other indians were running at	the ponies shrilling and waving blankets.	4.7358854861720685
12018. reverend jason got one	the canadians the others.	6.796825517045548
12019. i saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by	the twitching body of the man he had shot then run back to his position.	4.687507525226095
12020. the ponies were almost uncontrollable.	6.5155523300336915
12021. the pall of dust	they raised made it difficult to see when the aricaras charged again.	3.754793470433282
12022. this time more of them hurdled the barrier.	7.985461652994514
12023. a small indian dived at	montero who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt.	3.9372788559997325
12024. it sounded like a man kicking a melon.	7.3180070949138205
12025. above me a dark rider was	whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales.	3.9860593525934456
12026. although my shot killed his horse he rolled off the bale on top of	me.	5.8802215128687925
12027. i could smell woodsmoke grease and oil.	5.892115640046057
12028. his eyes were dark	fluid fearful and he gave a sigh as my knife went in.	5.859779635640017
12029. coming over the	wall he had seemed like a hideous devil.	4.317068102383446
12030. now under me i could see	him for what he really was a boy dressed up in streaks of paint h.	5.474569737346533
12031. the aricaras made one last desperate charge.	4.280553672808819
12032. it was pitiful	to see the thin ranks of warriors old and young wheeling and twisting	their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding	from their saddles by the relentless slam slam of the cruelly efficient	hawkinses.	4.5905485738851635
12033. others badly wounded gripped hands in manes knees	in bellies held on as long as possible and then weak from ghastly	wounds slipped sideways slowly almost thoughtfully to be broken under	the slashing hoofs.	3.799516518268438
12034. some gracefully soared from the backs of their	wounded screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the	lead split their hearts or tore their guts h.	4.7966753196021585
12035. none of them	reached our walls again.	6.246790306723405
12036. the few survivors grudgingly turned away.	6.154315537475853
12037. in	the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song.	4.324683550337179
12038. she was carrying a quirt and she started to raise it then let it fall	again and dangle from her wrist.	5.3284641992361985
12039. i saw your fire she	said speaking slowly making an effort to control her anger.	4.990523078455298
12040. you	could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size.	6.061647475240132
12041. it wouldn't	matter to a fool like you.	5.675564046890362
12042. all	right wilson said quickly.	8.457718703298294
12043. and i appreciate	the advice.	8.068371198038866
12044. he was losing patience again.	9.357464703205716
12045. an hour	before with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness	he would have appreciated company.	3.9466067709905506
12046. she had helped him change his mind.	8.583497209354785
12047. i'm not advising you she said.	5.374806366038539
12048. that fire's too big.	10.309336113069524
12049. and make sure it's out	when you leave in the morning.	4.74934191180265
12050. it	took him a long time to compose himself.	8.028789126465245
12051. there's some mistake	he said finally.	5.619635421798327
12052. you're right about the fire.	7.712079578137997
12053. it's bigger	than it has to be though i don't see where it's doing any	harm.	4.592972922053733
12054. but you're wrong about the rest of it.	8.598074887522412
12055. i'm not leaving in	the morning.	5.805525694497741
12056. why should i?	13.528189581085504
12057.  i own the place.	7.028761150033486
12058. she showed	her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so	that she could get a better look at his face.	5.265405079632951
12059. it didn't seem to tell	her anything.	6.488825965186287
12060. she glanced around the clearing taking in the wagon	and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground the	two kids the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the	far reaches of the firelight.	4.544443240025222
12061. she studied it for a long time.	7.343681544233495
12062. then	she turned back to wilson and smiled and he wasn't quite sure what	she meant	by it.	5.2288514545018705
12063. you own this place?	8.09303208031044
12064.  she said and her tone	had softened until it was almost friendly.	7.2298373554622595
12065. you bought it?	9.474318398684616
12066. 	from a man in st louis wilson said.	7.647032436079116
12067. the girl laughed.	5.586836683852929
12068. i ought to.	11.067037043475061
12069. my father ran him off here six years ago.	5.102143171198305
12070. he stood watching the girl wondering what	was coming next.	6.6099515300201
12071. she had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around	her wrist and smiling at him.	4.524883223897822
12072. carwood didn't tell you	that she said.	7.163184125958424
12073. but it's understandable.	7.933986034363298
12074. it's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of.	6.58273479204321
12075. and it doesn't make any difference.	6.861857595648465
12076. he sold me a clear title.	7.5139871259533155
12077. i	have it with me right here.	5.547012069810393
12078. if you want to see-   never	mind she said sternly.	8.958768161440185
12079. it wouldn't matter to my father	and not to me.	5.058432840031124
12080. i meant what i said about that fire.	6.9995046480612055
12081. be sure it's	out when you leave.	6.52628220593365
12082. i'll let you go back to doing the	dishes now.	6.426863688464411
12083. it was meant to insult him and didn't quite	succeed.	5.016127328380636
12084. he took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly	and it was his turn to smile now.	5.438848884234932
12085. i don't mind washing dishes now	and then he said pleasantly.	4.653836632802373
12086. it might hurt	you though.	11.879666387748657
12087. somebody might mistake you for a woman.	4.988306531290284
12088. he meant to say more but he never got the chance.	6.131046627477227
12089. she brought the quirt down slashing it across his cheek and he tried	to step back.	4.048164525365109
12090. she swung the quirt again and this time he caught her	wrist and pulled her out of the saddle.	6.187222544284541
12091. she came down against	him and he tried to break her fall.	4.869430034456084
12092. he grabbed her by the shoulders	and went down on one knee taking her weight so that some of the wind	was driven out of him.	5.394021382464746
12093. it made him a little sick and he let go of	her.	5.093558029905036
12094. he got up slowly and she was already on her feet and he stood	facing her.	5.971503465325683
12095. he wiped the blood from his cheek.	5.131969917669621
12096. i ought to-	he said.	9.645886477709713
12097. he was shaking with anger his breath coming in long	painful gasps.	4.697195195635426
12098. that quirt- i ought to use it on you where it would	do the most good.	6.539465220485895
12099. if you were a man-   she isn't	mister.	6.148369290393221
12100. the voice came from behind him and wilson turned.	5.8592637713438664
12101. the fire had gone down and the man was only a shadow against the	trees.	4.620881203281347
12102. but a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light	and wilson had a good look at him.	5.562566131741947
12103. he was tall and dark-skinned a	half-breed wilson thought.	5.401752651115104
12104. and he was handsome despite the long thin	scar that slanted across his cheek.	6.973258787224348
12105. she's not a man	mister he said.	5.314051075527792
12106. if you've got any ideas.	9.105715943212585
12107. he raised	the winchester and pointed it at wilson's chest.	4.645344995261077
12108. put	the rifle down joseph the girl said.	6.743273855772659
12109. i	thought i told you to stay home.	4.913686410369733
12110. the half-breed eased the	winchester down and rested it across his lap.	5.187735111958531
12111. the scar looked pure	white in the half-darkness; his eyes were black and deep-set and expressionless.	3.5775733849435465
12112. you shouldn't be riding up here after dark judith	he said quietly.	6.637655233826469
12113. i can take care of this.	7.509283784542849
12114. it's no job for	you.	8.635261040523314
12115. the girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee	and glared at him.	3.700225047417198
12116. he took it without flinching.	9.00579852480966
12117. i said	go home joseph.	7.028761150033486
12118. you've got no business up here.	7.286697111747534
12119. the half-breed	didn't answer this time.	4.747750369463677
12120. but the scar seemed to pull hard	at the corner of his mouth and his eyes were hurt and angry.	5.476726389670416
12121. he watched the half-breed as he turned silently.	4.862373123883983
12122. they	could hear the pony's feet on the dry leaves for a while then the	sound faded out.	5.783119345102084
12123. wilson brushed the dust from his coat.	4.913686410369733
12124. who	was that?	11.155741451300253
12125.  he asked.	8.80323508231408
12126. your personal guard?	11.639416974092143
12127.  you're pretty	hard on him.	6.162967476035402
12128. he works for my father the girl said	and then seemed to change her mind.	5.710115621554356
12129. his name's	joseph sanchez.	7.467635474117327
12130. is there anything else you want to know?	9.592007729840155
12131. 	not now wilson said.	6.162967476035402
12132. i guess i'll find out soon	enough.	7.95751090267089
12133. you've got blood on your cheek.	5.309667876505317
12134. it must	have got there when you fell against me.	6.941915920677784
12135. she wiped it off	with the sleeve of her coat.	4.892221409626493
12136. i'll bet that's as close as	you've been to a man since you were a baby wilson said.	5.057556181613073
12137. he saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle	of the quirt and he grabbed her wrist.	3.6406381471024516
12138. oh no he said	and	he was without humor now.	7.132311221561924
12139. i've had enough of that.	6.087013448880464
12140. i've had enough	of you.	8.738689702754533
12141. i don't know what goes on around here and i don't	care.	4.775985798833078
12142. i don't know what makes you think you can get away with this	kind of business and i don't care about that either.	5.732333712069422
12143. you took me	by surprise.	8.09303208031044
12144. but i'll know how to handle you next time.	8.108120073770051
12145. she brought up her free hand to hit him but this time he was quicker.	4.550301584126809
12146. he side-stepped her blow and she fell stumbling against the gelding.	5.925879823256658
12147. she finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle.	5.147014536287962
12148. her	hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders held by the string	and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before.	5.06435550114488
12149. he had forgotten that she was so pretty.	6.48422475273071
12150. but her prettiness was what	he had noticed first and all the other things had come afterward:	cruelty meanness self-will.	6.187141304322808
12151. he had known women like that one woman	in particular.	5.266637896765785
12152. and one had been too many.	10.123440005100473
12153. he watched the girl until	she had gone into the trees and waited until he couldn't hear the	sound of her horse any longer then went up to where the children were	sleeping.	3.558041127300218
12154. they weren't sleeping of course but they thought	they were doing him a favor by pretending.	5.518197821347934
12155. he hadn't shown up too	well in their eyes letting himself be browbeaten by a woman.	3.9072530517863884
12156. they	expected greater things from him regardless of how trying the circumstances	and they were disappointed.	5.486891664636133
12157. and determined not to show it.	6.005120130982017
12158. they	lay a little too stiffly with their eyes straining to stay closed.	5.857302796582849
12159. go to sleep he said.	6.470685659511256
12160. there's better	things to do than listen to something like that.	5.9245075971793435
12161. i'll be down at	the creek finishing the dishes if you want me.	4.360604187931099
12162. he found	the	pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream.	6.107442558864749
12163. the coyote was calling again and he hoped that this time there would	be no other sounds to interrupt it.	3.3564185518874785
12164. not tonight at any rate.	9.408829979339309
12165. he had	a feeling that the girl meant trouble.	5.096111130646612
12166. if she did he could stand	it better in the light.	7.237897280483904
12167. he scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans	and reflected on how things had turned out.	4.083443138568456
12168. that afternoon when they	had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house his hopes had	been high.	6.344609260553344
12169. already some of the pain had gone from amelia's death.	5.973551907709264
12170. there would still be plenty of moments of regret and	sadness and guilty relief.	6.8975135224771895
12171. but they were starting a new life.	6.07350978802957
12172. and they	had almost everything they needed: land a house two whiteface	bulls three horses.	5.716027637308258
12173. the land wasn't all wilson had expected	of it.	4.511984453226962
12174. six hundred and forty acres the old man back in st louis	had said; good grass good water.	5.3797242858978045
12175. well the grass was there though	in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it.	4.203128937663154
12176. the	water was there so much of it that it spread all through	the dead orchard.	6.4668326123297515
12177. and there was a house; livable perhaps but	badly in need of repairs.	6.249048581722568
12178. in the last analysis though wilson	had little cause to complain.	7.398110672725893
12179. the place had been cheap- just the	little he had left after amelia's burial- and it would serve its	purpose.	3.4738349390053456
12180. there was only one place where jake carwood's description	had gone badly awry: the peace and quiet.	6.398548093563638
12181. it hadn't started out	that way.	6.702258878046396
12182. and he had a feeling- thanks to the girl- that things	would get worse before they got better.	6.826565612378563
12183. they had the house cleaned	up by noon and wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring	in the horses.	4.472832692749493
12184. he stood on the porch and watched him struggling with	the heavy harness and finally went over to help him.	5.514313785264191
12185. kathy was already	in the wagon.	5.6600783621850885
12186. they were going to town and they were both excited.	8.30014688394227
12187. wilson backed the team into the traces and wished they weren't	going to town at all.	3.8101576301595865
12188. he had an uneasy feeling about it.	8.519716560632196
12189. that girl	last night what was her name?	5.674616284194667
12190.  judith pierce.	11.155741451300253
12191. it was the only	thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember.	5.137680716451257
12192. he finished	with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him.	5.603893504423084
12193. he had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning and in	broad daylight it was even less inviting than judith pierce had made	it seem.	3.7150205360249444
12194. there was brush and stands of pine that no grass could grow	under and places so steep that cattle wouldn't stop to graze.	5.2461516790041145
12195. there was an artificial lake just out of sight in	the first stand of trees fed by a half dozen springs that popped out	of the ground above the hillside orchard.	3.904134777710768
12196. yes there was plenty of water	too much and that was probably the trouble.	6.6212075774091534
12197. there were tracks	of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres.	4.747140183018488
12198. the first	part of the road was steep but it leveled off after the second bend and	curled gradually into the valley.	4.891732434099078
12199. it was hotter once they reached	the flat and drier but the grass was better.	4.2169987500942945
12200. a warm breeze played across	it moving it like waves.	6.0797568470216365
12201. a red-tailed hawk flew in behind them	and stayed there watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might	stir up from the side of the road.	3.976969068906845
12202. it took them an hour before they came	to the first houses of kelseyville.	6.344645899524256
12203. the town was about what	wilson expected: one main street with its rows of false-fronted	buildings a water tower a few warehouses a single hotel; all dusty	and sunbaked.	3.2060193687026106
12204. such was my state of mind that i did not question the possibility	of	this; under the circumstances i was only too willing to confess all.	5.457585331605916
12205. i was nearly thirty at the time.	6.024277797624991
12206. i went to the hall in the	afternoons only on these preliminary matters.	6.927178325276958
12207. it was dark and i sensed	very large; only the counter at one end was lighted by a long	fluorescent tube suspended directly above it.	3.6281653374328955
12208. sometimes i was aware	of people moving about in the darkness.	7.500850068861862
12209. i would turn away from my	writing	in the hope of getting a good look at them but i never quite succeeded.	4.422706274470405
12210. a glimpse of three of four vague figures at the most.	5.826838816530295
12211. squatting as if waiting.	6.2303643659513295
12212. the pulsing glow of	a cigarette.	6.5155523300336915
12213. since they could see me but i not them their presence	in the hall disturbed me.	4.5187557808444065
12214. the clerk paid them no attention.	6.154713990487742
12215. this impressed	me until i realized how limited was his sphere of influence.	4.157601580199868
12216. his job simply consisted in registering new men.	6.691769384389967
12217. when the phone rang	he answered it.	6.390696568519498
12218. his authority extended to the far edge of the counter	no further.	7.3058699122331054
12219. none of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak	to him.	5.467789536457387
12220. baldness was attacking his pate.	7.712079578137997
12221. he spoke to me in a gruff	voice an affectation which quite belied his personality.	4.176100322837621
12222. he wore	his white shirt open at the neck revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest	underneath.	6.141470599475526
12223. it was obvious that he wished himself different from the	sort of person he thought he was.	4.315452202829664
12224. but it was not easy for him and he	often slipped.	10.484762274526076
12225. when one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the	floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle i noticed how the	clerk winced.	4.4391001503495175
12226. i felt certain he was really a spineless little man.	6.384433951723228
12227. his hat hung on a hook on the wall and	underneath it i could see his tie knotted ready to be slipped over	his head a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to	have left his neck.	3.4451881169490877
12228. the morning's tabloids were on the counter and	a stack of dog-eared men's magazines.	5.546393846010627
12229. on a shelf in the office behind	the counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station which	broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular music.	3.8612098227797786
12230. everything	about the clerk was trivial.	7.712079578137997
12231. once pressing him i learned that his	job was only part-time in the afternoons when nothing went on in the	hall.	3.896225422287245
12232. noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps	and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person.	4.9054819635267055
12233. with distaste i saw him assume a pompous air.	5.053936195851219
12234. when he saw me coming	he turned his radio off.	7.8530805626744415
12235. he made a show of rearranging my forms on	the shelf.	5.236572480377302
12236. he would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence	then bark into it with gruff importance.	6.035629630306412
12237. what limited knowledge he	possessed he forced upon me.	5.312697960154714
12238. in the mornings i was informed fluorescent	tubes similar to the one above the counter illuminated the entire	hall.	5.6301890223195885
12239. they and the two large fans which i could dimly see as	daylight filtered through their vents down at the far end of the hall	could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office.	3.7484283641369323
12240. he	pointed out the switch to me and for a moment i foolishly believed	that he would let deed follow words.	5.730778800509347
12241. i was shown instead a batch of	white tickets of the sort handed out he told me every morning.	4.452363744266129
12242. now	here was something of obvious importance to me yet when i reached	for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand.	4.807873378411027
12243. he couldn't afford	to have anyone mess around with them he said.	4.318068015596563
12244. each of those tickets	was of great value to its rightful recipient.	6.720400063469519
12245. later i would remember what this pompous little man had told me about	the worth of a ticket.	3.9914289060710835
12246. having nothing else to do except wait	for my forms to be processed i gave myself over to speculations concerning	the hall itself.	5.06580284815559
12247. when suitably lighted what would it look like?	5.283245066789037
12248. 	the presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the	hall could become crowded for air.	5.951519514903176
12249. one afternoon upon receiving permission	and the necessary instructions from the clerk i had visited	the toilet adjoining the hall.	3.9307392402930605
12250. by counting the number of stalls and	urinals i attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall	would hold at one time.	5.674855590982968
12251. for although i had crossed a corner of the	hall on my way to the toilet i still could not tell for sure how far	to the rear the darkness extended.	3.8007478115190674
12252. i could observe the two fans down	at the end but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long	as i had no measure of comparison.	4.999314931648225
12253. i had for some time been hoping	in vain for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and	myself.	4.769157412227046
12254. i knew that three or four of them were almost always present	in the hall but what they were doing and exactly where i could not	tell.	5.95871133594534
12255. it was i felt possible that they were men who having received no	tickets for that day had remained in the hall to sleep perhaps in	the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light.	3.812062178619942
12256. this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall and my eyes	were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through	the fan vents when i tried to pick out whatever might be lying or	squatting on the floor below.	4.7280336986247065
12257. also the clerk appeared to disapprove	of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder.	4.41760868646532
12258. no sooner would	i turn my head away from the counter before he would address me at	times quite sharply in order to bring back my attention.	5.991960039106811
12259. and i had	hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion	when the lights in that place like the hall lights controlled from	the switch in the office flicked off and on impatiently.	3.6149267965141982
12260. this sort	of petty vigilance annoyed me.	7.416165143643923
12261. i felt certain it was self-appointed.	5.79563393273625
12262. it sprang from a type of mentality i'd encountered often enough but	certainly had not expected to find here.	5.644551184734923
12263. i decided to see no more of	the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed.	4.178676519946582
12264. i	felt strongly attached to the hall however and hardly a day passed when	i did not go to look at it from a distance.	5.526671842794305
12265. i lived in a state of	suspense because of it.	5.315082267248313
12266. i could not cling to my past nor did i wish	to.	6.78325498609233
12267. i had signed it off on the forms.	5.7210684451136595
12268. my future lay solely with the	hall yet what did i know about the hall at this point?	5.380123202930341
12269.  although	i had been inside it i had not yet seen it functioning.	4.221731766955911
12270. i wished to	prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes i ought to	be wearing.	5.73928912983362
12271. i did not despair however; far from it! i was constantly	searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall.	4.096554892904954
12272. though	only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town	its character was wholly foreign to me.	4.920292053327142
12273. large warehouses flanked the	street on which the hall fronted.	5.181858710688092
12274. the river was only a few blocks away	but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it.	5.221866745411867
12275. sometimes	i noticed the tops of ships' masts and funnels reaching above the	pier roofs.	4.016830420674678
12276. the sounds issuing from beyond- winches whirring men	shouting- indicated great activity and excited me.	4.900407540562956
12277. the hall on the	other hand appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront	afternoons.	3.8019177983870396
12278. it resembled nothing i'd ever seen before.	7.788832957144139
12279. its front	was windowless but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication	that windows now blinded had once looked out upon the street.	3.727444208668207
12280. i	kept circling the block hoping to see from the street behind it the	rear of the hall.	5.290687358829606
12281. but it was not a tall structure and other buildings	concealed it.	6.810320590714743
12282. for weeks i wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses	and garages truck terminals and taxi repair shops gasoline pumps	and longshoremen's lunch counters yet never did i cease to feel	myself a stranger there.	4.643082295952543
12283. i returned to the hall despite my dislike	for the clerk.	5.052442099707034
12284. as i had expected he insisted that my visits	to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application.	6.1956874087252025
12285. meanwhile spring had passed well into summer.	5.496600874602202
12286. at last when i put	it to him directly the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my	case was unusual.	6.039669969454798
12287. when i asked him what if anything i could do about	it he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall.	4.664422412057609
12288. i could consult this personage on any weekday morning though not before	ten o'clock.	6.127807227058678
12289. the clerk impressed this upon me: that i should	not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock.	3.470558666016351
12290. when i went for my interview	with the director i saw why.	6.851258157836381
12291. although it was dark as usual i	could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people.	4.783695254485321
12292. cigarette butts littered the floor.	7.712079578137997
12293. the big fans were going drawing	from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drifted about	in pale strata underneath the ceiling.	3.445983783677521
12294. i had felt the draft they were	making while mounting the stairs.	6.749256427663574
12295. the staircase itself seemed still	to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men.	3.6311862882065773
12296. i stopped by the counter.	8.667966011188964
12297. no one was behind it but in the rear wall of the office i noticed	for the first time a door which had been left partially open.	4.672686104219385
12298. past it i could see part of a desk a flag in a corner a rug on	the floor.	6.188530354988165
12299. i rapped my knuckles on the counter.	5.406629921006237
12300. the director came to the door.	8.319520022564744
12301. i was at once disappointed although	just what i had expected him to look like i could not have explained.	4.412398910098877
12302. he was a man in his late forties with graying hair of medium	height; he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit brown silk	tie and green-tinted soft collar.	5.6242330651051535
12303. he wore perforated white-topped	shoes;	they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance	routine any moment.	3.932741598130775
12304. but he came toward me sedately enough showed	me around the counter offered me a seat inside his office then walked	to a file cabinet and got out my application.	4.88113487543729
12305. i had the impression	that he had read my forms perhaps several times.	5.047971088130133
12306. he did not look	at them now.	9.784240381811507
12307. as he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk i wondered	what this dapper slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to	do with the workings of the hall.	3.7282682852764575
12308. he spoke in a voice as immaculate	as his appearance.	6.791590003030391
12309. why had i registered?	8.117814590196925
12310.  begging my pardon he	must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying	at the hall.	5.145836132686857
12311. he had looked over my forms and was impressed by	what he had seen there; indeed my scholastic qualifications were such	that he a college graduate himself must envy me them.	3.519166698185057
12312. was i sure	he asked that i knew what i was applying for?	6.114025736179187
12313.  what sort of men	i would come into contact with at the hall?	5.204460183581626
12314.  these questions did	not surprise	me; i felt certain that the director like the afternoon clerk	seldom moved beyond the counter that the hall to them was a jungle	a dark and unwelcome place.	4.782377023590086
12315. though i doubted that he would understand	me i told the director my motives for applying.	4.73294549633819
12316. i had always i	said hankered after working hard with my hands.	6.7475871192937165
12317. this desire i went	on growing voluble as my conviction was aroused had mounted at such	a rate recently that i now found its realization necessary not only	to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing.	3.382331550079749
12318. to this effect i	had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence.	5.8272599523090545
12319. the flat hard cap was small but he thrust it to the back of his head.	4.061125418260183
12320. hell with it.	9.52328749892442
12321. before	they could guess his intention rankin stepped forward and swung the	guard's own gun against the uncovered head hard.	3.632711015013689
12322. the man went over	without sound falling to the bare floor.	6.228924009517091
12323. barton said harshly	why did you do that?	4.913686410369733
12324.    rankin sneered at him.	8.457718703298294
12325. what	did you want me to do kiss him?	4.916577167992787
12326.  he dumped me in solitary twice.	7.5139871259533155
12327. barton caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung him	around.	4.477601198394805
12328. let's get one thing straight you and me.	6.412214371980113
12329. the	only reason we brought you was to get miller out.	4.52925051317698
12330. if you ever try anything	without my orders i'll kill you.	7.069133625974962
12331. fred rankin looked	at him.	6.162967476035402
12332. it seemed to barton that the green eyes mocked him the	thin-lipped smile held insolence but he had no time to waste now.	5.9073914420265
12333. they filed out through the	guard-room door into the paved square.	4.578692520135531
12334. there were three other men within	this prison whom barton would have liked to liberate but they	were in other cell blocks.	5.527102386179122
12335. they moved slowly toward	the main gate following the wall.	4.770496407217191
12336. they had	chosen this night purposely.	8.451230752941052
12337. they reached the guard house without alerting	the men on the walls above and powers slipped through the door.	3.9220145814971485
12338. two men were on duty inside playing pinochle relaxed.	7.352416147402984
12339. they	looked up in surprise as powers came in.	4.6724501027054846
12340. what are you doing	out of the block?	8.448544071505328
12341.    it's curtiss he said naming	the man rankin had hit.	4.477601198394805
12342. i've got to have help.	7.712079578137997
12343. the sergeant in charge climbed to his feet.	4.1174608023645085
12344. what's wrong with him?	8.973326091919457
12345.    he's having some kind	of a fit.	5.219666477665999
12346. the sergeant turned to the door.	6.905207145606717
12347. as he passed through	it barton shoved his gun against the man's side.	4.808001223801902
12348. one	sound and you're dead.	8.457718703298294
12349. powers had	not followed.	6.939425769494729
12350. powers was covering the remaining guard.	7.163184125958424
12351. the man half-reached	for the cord of the alarm bell.	4.725851684042368
12352. powers knocked his arm aside.	7.712079578137997
12353. deliberately with none of rankin's viciousness he laid the barrel	of his gun alongside the guard's head.	3.744109221929566
12354. even barton could not quite believe it.	7.918539841837454
12355. it had gone without a hitch.	7.196277537963408
12356. they slid through the wicket in the big gate ghosted across the dark	ground.	6.201185202034952
12357. five minutes later they reached the horses.	5.817938751304489
12358. barton was relieved	to see that carl dill and emmett foster had brought extra mounts.	5.331440467598945
12359. he had been worried that with miller and rankin added to the	escape party they would be short.	4.54535301502257
12360. they walked	the horses heading along the river barton and emmett foster in	the lead seven men riding quietly through the night.	5.031164312904003
12361. the only	thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform	of prison guards three the striped suits of convicts.	3.5283753784863636
12362. in a small grove against the river they halted turning	deep into the protection of the trees.	5.803560304946385
12363. foster had brought extra clothing	also.	5.619635421798327
12364. he had been one of the original night	riders one who had escaped the trial.	8.40171830014423
12365. it was to him that barton	had sent carl dill on dill's release from the prison.	4.532055024549597
12366. clyde	miller was crying softly to himself shedding his striped suit	and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants the worn brown shirt.	4.861416487662795
12367. kid boyd was unusually silent rankin watchful a few paces apart.	4.222695686081208
12368. barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to powers.	5.9245075971793435
12369. i won't even try to thank you.	5.406629921006237
12370. the ex-prison guard	was embarrassed.	6.996493558081793
12371. he said in a studied voice i didn't do it for	you.	5.577003406791004
12372. i did it for the valley.	9.897718188963829
12373. you're the only man the night riders	will follow.	5.233827459512935
12374. we've been starving and i don't like to starve.	6.315431879233957
12375. barton turned away his eyes falling upon rankin beside	his horse.	4.317068102383446
12376. the murderer lifted his head.	6.5155523300336915
12377. meaning you want me to ride out?	4.913686410369733
12378.    you aren't	one of us.	11.1064335578917
12379. there's nothing for you here.	5.619635421798327
12380. i got no place	to go.	8.663245175561022
12381. he did not trust rankin his	violent temper his killer instinct.	5.394089959116308
12382. but ten years in prison had taught	him realities.	6.9332890522555335
12383. they were in a fight outweighed in both numbers and	money.	5.554100324442437
12384. it was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses to	call them night riders to set out to attack the largest mining combination	the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure.	4.970678455020616
12385. but	if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals men who	knew how to use a gun against men who would match the killers on the	other side.	3.5384326570386175
12386. your choice he said briefly and turned to	kid boyd.	7.424859137153615
12387. bury those uniforms so they won't be found.	4.6724501027054846
12388. then barton touched carl dill's arm and moved off up the river	bank.	6.005699441700637
12389. he wanted a careful uninterrupted report from dill on the	conditions in the valley.	4.328318871949453
12390. they squatted on their heels in the	deep mud and dill found a cigar in his breast pocket passing it over	silently.	5.031164312904003
12391. he too knew the agony of going for weeks sometimes months	without the solace of tobacco.	3.9891056137641625
12392. mitchell barton drew in the fragrance	deeply letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat	for a moment before he exhaled.	5.121246174739485
12393. through the gloom he could not	see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly.	4.14837553391018
12394. for his	first five years in prison they had shared a cell.	6.390553814820384
12395. carl dill	was neither a rancher nor a valley man.	4.477601198394805
12396. he had been the auditor for	the mining syndicate and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the	syndicate's money.	6.776017972775863
12397. he had done time for the theft.	6.611123137091548
12398. the one	thing they had in common was their hatred.	5.4678654398730995
12399. it had drawn them together and since his release from prison dill	had worked tirelessly to effect this night's escape.	4.0373941614779305
12400. he	said	now i've got the perfect headquarters set up.	6.412214371980113
12401. mitch barton knew the place.	5.619635421798327
12402. twenty years before	a group of easterners had bought out the haskell claims in the rocky	hills south of grass valley.	5.299145688274295
12403. they had spent a million dollars carving	in a road putting up buildings drilling their haulage tunnel.	4.209356306884263
12404. then	the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned.	6.49507707027936
12405. the road's washed badly said dill but there's a	trail you can get over with a horse.	3.7257847682912426
12406. a company of cavalry couldn't	come in there if two men were guarding that trail.	5.605602986284614
12407. how do the valley people feel?	6.624033631919011
12408.    as mad as ever.	10.022565594858504
12409. but kruger's men keep them off balance and they don't trust	me.	4.452373707595423
12410. when they learn you're in the hills though	they'll rally don't worry about that.	6.3836415153358725
12411. barton waited	for a long moment then asked the question which lay always uppermost	in his mind.	3.8101576301595865
12412. did you find him?	9.87296046025907
12413.    dill	was silent as if he hated to answer and barton had a cold sick feeling	of apprehension.	4.0644827558960674
12414. barton half-straightened in surprise.	8.457718703298294
12415. what's he doing	there?	6.939425769494729
12416.    again dill hesitated.	12.089575262357485
12417. dealing faro?	8.12896173865557
12418.  how come?	14.858321558760375
12419.    your sister-in-law has	the faro bank in cap ayres' saloon.	4.988492008688855
12420. barton cursed under	his breath.	8.457718703298294
12421. after another long pause he asked how many people	know who they are?	4.589649385946585
12422.    everyone.	13.921774766768346
12423. your cousin finley saw	to that.	6.568815526344989
12424. he's quite a rat you know.	7.163184125958424
12425. he sold out to kruger's men.	5.475289483739853
12426. he's informed them of everything you've ever written him.	6.144814417540349
12427. barton stood up.	6.939425769494729
12428. he said tensely all	right.	11.5336567611591
12429. let's go get the boy.	5.738537126098895
12430. dill had come up also.	7.712079578137997
12431. i	was afraid of this.	6.162967476035402
12432. i almost didn't tell you.	8.667966011188964
12433. if	you hadn't i'd have killed you.	5.574142163030234
12434. but you can't ride into the ferry.	7.980283384826022
12435. that's what they'll	expect you to do.	5.219666477665999
12436. they'll be there waiting for you.	7.163184125958424
12437. i understand	how you feel about the child h.	5.100396573550883
12438. barton's	voice was rougher than dill had ever heard it.	6.144814417540349
12439. my wife died in childbirth after i was sent away.	4.894494855284679
12440. i	can't leave him there.	8.457718703298294
12441. donald kruger would like nothing better	than to hold him as hostage and i wouldn't entrust a snake to his	tender care.	3.542415248362911
12442. i've got to get the boy.	9.260522054066268
12443. two	barton's men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen	places carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult.	3.5853166747464886
12444. it	was over an hour before their escape was discovered but still the	news that barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state.	5.213583152256525
12445. it reached donald kruger in his massive home in burlingame.	4.834770518737059
12446. it reached the mines at north san juan and bloomfield.	6.634974012353968
12447. it	brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences.	4.608939921223989
12448. for everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg and	mitchell barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence.	5.087046631869109
12449. creighton hague sat in his office above the ione pit.	4.617985211519548
12450. the	office was of logs four rooms each heated by an iron stove.	5.583228874976599
12451. the	building was dwarfed by the scene outside.	4.913686410369733
12452. there a dozen giant monitors	played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam	of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside.	5.645322601368239
12453. the gravel was	the bed of an ancient river buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of	earth.	3.627764683163452
12454. it was partially cemented by ages and pressure yet it crumpled	before the onslaught of the powerful streams the force of a thousand	fire hoses and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices.	5.271913101518389
12455. a million dollars' of gold a month.	4.852074874435709
12456. a million tons of rock	and soil and brush.	6.916001842103723
12457. the monitors ran twenty-four hours each day.	4.280553672808819
12458. their roar like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could	be heard for miles.	6.180883222196969
12459. hague like all who worked near the pits was partly	deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums.	3.685338251241182
12460. he	was a big man wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill	air.	5.544584763862161
12461. fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt.	4.729883336180988
12462. ten years older	than mitch barton he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits	to manager of the operation.	5.422283666681133
12463. he was proud of his accomplishments	proud of his job proud that donald kruger and his associates trusted	him.	4.148684278972948
12464. he lived and breathed for the mining company.	7.31956367708691
12465. no	man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless and	hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life.	3.636837373751601
12466. there	came a ghost of noise at the office door and hague swung to see kodyke	in the entrance from the outer room.	4.981375448697338
12467. hague had never accustomed	himself to kodyke.	5.219666477665999
12468. the man was tall thin with a narrow face and	a too-large nose.	6.0126049623846765
12469. the eyes always held hague eyes of a dead man lidless	as a lizard's with the fixed intensity of a cobra.	3.6299736815435932
12470. even hague	was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was kodyke.	6.721635096985066
12471. he knew nothing about the man's history.	5.996478917308769
12472. kodyke had appeared at the	mine one day bearing a letter from kruger.	5.985417069601519
12473. kodyke was to head the	dread company police.	4.913686410369733
12474. he ran the change rooms.	8.130765537050925
12475. he threw out the hi-graders.	6.605096773906071
12476. he supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw	gold which each week went out to san francisco.	5.2321479849811805
12477. hague squeezed	down his uneasy dislike.	5.619635421798327
12478. he pulled open the top drawer of his desk	and drew out a tintype.	5.603893504423084
12479. he broke	out of folsom last night.	5.475289483739853
12480. apparently he bribed one of the guards.	10.20355622969301
12481. we want him back there or we want him dead.	5.085567004548765
12482. kodyke took the	picture in a lean hand studying it thoughtfully.	5.9245075971793435
12483. you know how the ranchers in the	valley are.	6.216643857403243
12484. they blame us for all their troubles.	7.533483806578034
12485. ten years ago they	blew up some of our ditches.	5.420903844968072
12486. it cost us a hundred thousand dollars	and thirty days lost time to fix them.	6.05854961223124
12487. we don't want barton's night	riders loose again.	5.497086847134583
12488. the gunman nodded slipping the picture	into his breast pocket saying nothing.	5.187735111958531
12489. normally hague	wasted no words but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although	he knew kodyke was aware of all he said.	3.5044068192608764
12490. if she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother she	did not comment upon it.	6.53660254159463
12491. after they had finished eating melissa	took sprite the kitten under her arm- so that auntie grace	can teach it about the whistle- and climbed into the station wagon	beside her mother.	3.4960515463439665
12492. she had offered to walk but pamela knew she	would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided	her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called	auntie.	5.095478433174341
12493. when they reached their neighbor's house pamela	said a few polite words to grace and kissed melissa lightly on	the forehead the impulse prompted by a stray thought- of the type	to which she was frequently subject these days- that they might never	see one another again.	3.410902242651876
12494. then she turned the station wagon around and	headed it back down the hill with the village as her ostensible destination.	5.484615322947437
12495. as she drove she thought about her plan.	5.750613528044458
12496. it was really	quite simple.	10.171929519490117
12497. so simple in fact that it might even work- although	pamela now in her new frame of mind was careful not to pretend	too much assurance.	4.0635548584754275
12498. that mistake she thought had cost her dearly	these past few days and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of	the traps that the mountain might set for her.	4.802248250862565
12499. she must be cautious	so as not to alert the scheming forest.	4.552777014141222
12500. when the station wagon	drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the culver	house pamela turned the wheel guiding the car to its familiar	parking spot close to the house and stopped.	5.619460279364024
12501. all of her movements	were careful and methodical partaking of the stealth of a criminal who	has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which	step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime.	3.72410309467928
12502. she locked the ignition removed the keys stepped out of the car and	went into the house.	6.551109906717731
12503. here she dropped the keys on a small table beside	the door and went upstairs to her bedroom.	4.045280163230825
12504. on her bureau lay	a small brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving- an	object which pamela believed now had been the property of her	great-grandfather	major hiram munroe culver.	5.258558847024906
12505. he had belonged to this	land and perhaps had desecrated it- and this was the only material	symbol that remained of him.	4.83458894999584
12506. if she pamela were being held responsible	for his crimes then hers must be the final act of expiation.	5.680632774233889
12507. she	would return this symbol to the mountain as one pours seed back into	the soil every spring h or as ancient fertility cults demand annual	human sacrifice.	3.4441263896621424
12508. slowly and thoughtfully she slipped the	ornament into the pocket of her slacks moved down the stairs and out	of the house.	4.861416487662795
12509. there was only one place where the mountain might receive	her- that unnamed unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom.	4.338809913928686
12510. atonement if atonement were possible could only be made at that sacred	sacrificial basin.	5.569101247290859
12511. it was there that she would have to enact her	renunciation beg forgiveness.	5.790983613178933
12512. perhaps it was insane pamela	thought.	9.798441645655636
12513. perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream.	5.8254894739763765
12514. but she was	caught in it and she faced the terrible possibility that if it were	a dream it was one from which she might never awaken.	5.040049907274368
12515. facing	the forest now she who had not dared to enter it before walked between	two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction	of the pool.	3.305507658629995
12516. she remembered little of her previous journey there with	grace and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission	would enable her to accomplish it.	4.822496249615975
12517. the forest was open and freely	welcoming extending an enchanted hand.	3.873609698987832
12518. the ground was covered with	soft pine needles and the slope was gentle.	5.310485873306032
12519. birds chirped and chattered	in the trees and the sun all dewy-eyed and soft caressed her shoulders	warmly from time to time.	3.8377619831331145
12520. it was not thought pamela such	an evil place after all.	7.418963530810492
12521. no wonder melissa responded so completely to	its beckoning.	5.376325059850291
12522. perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees	that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed.	5.963015825385277
12523. was it not	possible after all that the forest was in league with her and her	child h that its sympathy lay with the culvers h that she had erred	in failing to understand this?	3.608963251476315
12524.    pamela felt calm and peaceful	as she walked along.	6.412214371980113
12525. the slight flutter that had disturbed the motion	of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now and even the	dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken	her fear.	3.0848980720684347
12526. she regarded them as signs that she was nearing the	glen she sought and she was glad to at last be doing something positive	in her unenunciated undefined struggle with the mountain and its	darkling inhabitants.	4.926135050939289
12527. having persisted too long in deliberate	ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her pamela was relieved	now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward	grappling with them.	3.7620526346403094
12528. a few days ago she would have thought such an	expedition as this utterly ridiculous; today on the contrary it	seemed utterly reasonable.	5.970026005309613
12529. she did not pause to consider what	she would do if her plan should fail; she directed all of her mental	and physical energy toward achieving this one goal.	3.5707275467937727
12530. if as she walked	her steps fumbled from time to time she chose to ignore that omen.	6.046831215759477
12531. if the slope grew steeper and the groves more dim she tried not to	heed.	4.262824586101729
12532. success depended upon maintaining her equanimity; she must be	poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that	she was in earnest.	5.24512570697026
12533. the forest took on an impersonal aspect.	4.2805176720881475
12534. it did not care what sort of person prowled its woods plucked at its	bark or stripped the berries from its bushes.	5.47554509470925
12535. unconcerned indifferent	unmotivated the forest was simply there- fighting man's depredations	with more abundant growth and man's follies with its own musical	evening laughter.	3.6848618390735517
12536. red man or white man pacifist or killer the	forest would accept them all- knowing that it could thrive equally	well on slaughter and beneficence; knowing that its ageless mass would	always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man.	4.613294573260584
12537. she must not think about time.	5.963806287219188
12538. that was another	one of those traps.	9.374478992291147
12539. in her grim pursuit of tranquillity pamela	focused her thoughts on her husband.	4.49554017889482
12540. if when this was all over she	found the words to tell him about it she wondered if he would ever	understand.	5.520108358099611
12541. how could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent?	5.041210324745948
12542. 	indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights nor would his	days be haunted by the dimly-outlined ill-conceived figure of her	benighted ancestor.	4.807873378411027
12543. his bright daylight mind would whistle away such	images; they would not dare to face his scoffing.	3.9514091633390196
12544. pamela was	glad jim was nowhere near.	7.163184125958424
12545. his presence would have interfered with	her duty.	5.148511793411897
12546. the mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once	or twice on the smooth pine needles.	4.900432726990401
12547. the trees huddled more closely together	their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against	the sun.	3.547213601874343
12548. bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours	for the	struggling stranger and without the direct light of the sun to	act as compass pamela could no longer be positive of her direction.	5.132414745829059
12549. nevertheless she continued to move upward.	6.081250483799051
12550. she was sure she	would reach the pool by climbing and she clung to that belief despite	the increasing number of obstacles.	5.7102576280632045
12551. the forest had become an alien	world where she strove alone unprotected unguided to deal with whatever	hindrances were offered.	3.6064278355335975
12552. it was a bold dark castle of pine boughs	that stood like a medieval fortress eclipsing the sun and human	time.	5.895581304938666
12553. at one and the same time she was within it but still searching	for the drawbridge that would give her entry.	4.9263322422770495
12554. silence came into	the forest- a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring	mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees.	4.67288338831304
12555. silence	walked at pamela's side its presence numbingly close yet too far	for her to hear.	3.8849121559715263
12556. silence stood in front of her waiting and in back	of her blocking her retreat.	6.272587888632253
12557. she stumbled over the root of a	tree that protruded maliciously above the earth.	4.248379634311886
12558. in spite of her attempt	to preserve her balance she fell bruising her arm on a naked stone.	5.7658885162778635
12559. for a moment she could not catch her breath and then her breath	returning in short frightened spasms she lifted herself to her feet	laboriously.	4.0436816034507
12560. she started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her	clothes.	6.172163079962026
12561. her arm bled slightly and the offended skin cried out in	pain.	4.584184976644379
12562. she was bewildered.	13.043030680724906
12563. she seemed to	have come such a long distance- too far for her destination which had	wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees.	3.755412740545775
12564. she stood	quite still trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn a	path to follow a clue to guide her.	5.384424018920419
12565. she was standing in a thick	grove.	6.582757702047355
12566. the trees were crowded so closely together that their branches	overlapped virtually shutting out the sun completely.	4.868001484970744
12567. the earth	smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived of the cleansing	effect of the sun's rays.	3.3564185518874785
12568. she had the feeling that under the mouldering	leaves there would be the bodies of dead animals quietly decaying	and giving their soil back to the mountain.	6.641104121866741
12569. the thought	made pamela shudder.	5.098202453568707
12570. a terrible chill swept through the grove.	7.0035286563335175
12571. not	a breeze exactly but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome	familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove catching pamela	in a leering embrace.	3.3515864650355898
12572. there was a peculiar density about it a thick	substance that could be sensed but never identified never actually perceived.	6.090305106981174
12573. where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such	a scene?	4.7081534146775335
12574.  she already knew this unwholesome chilling atmosphere that	was somehow grotesquely alive.	6.197871288603115
12575. it enclosed her clammy hands and twined	around her ankles.	5.058432840031124
12576. it crept into the open neck of her blouse and	slid down her body seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores	of her skin.	5.045442226894166
12577. it crawled across her breasts suffocating the life	in her nipples.	4.834770518737059
12578. it circled her thighs exploring with its icy tentacles.	6.941915920677784
12579. it entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus and	its particles spreading creeping crawling joined themselves into	steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached; stifled	her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps; clutched her	throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was	dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched	together in the rigid fixture of her jaws.	3.000572966981034
12580. she had to	get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid	of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain depriving her	of reason and sight.	4.843174423870698
12581. but she did not know which way to go.	5.607112783799213
12582. the shadows	of the trees engulfed her foreclosing every possible exit from the	grove.	5.078074081494962
12583. she had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around	her throat in ever-tightening circles.	4.339902626577813
12584. she could not scream	for even if a sound could take shape within her parched mouth who	would hear who would listen?	5.433511787380875
12585.    does the mountain listen?	8.494880114912831
12586. 	pamela groped blindly.	9.52328749892442
12587. she had to move in	some direction- any direction that would take her away from this evil	place.	4.202528672936249
12588. she thrust forward through the shadows and the trees	that resisted her and tried to fling her back.	5.719992107867504
12589. her own body protested	aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed where cold	demon wisps still clung and caressed.	3.7806143096383806
12590. every movement she made	seemed unnecessarily noisy.	8.221303675884403
12591. twigs cracked loudly under her feet;	bushes swished and scratched at her slacks; tree branches snapped	as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her.	3.467766426174774
12592. miraculously she found exactly the right statement.	6.743273855772659
12593. she began	it deliberately so that none of her words would be lost on him.	4.274463368422166
12594. i want to tell you something thomas demontez lord.	8.370052666279996
12595. i'm	well aware that you've got a pedigree as long as my leg and that i	don't amount to anything.	4.062834994555789
12596. but-   but it don't matter	a-tall lord supplied fondly.	6.412214371980113
12597. to me you'll always be the	girl o' my dreams an' the sweetest flower that grows.	4.157651892266993
12598. beaming	idiotically he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her.	5.739974350684024
12599. she yanked away from him furiously.	6.4183656236106685
12600. you shut up! shu-tt	up-pp! i've got something to say to you and by god you're	going to listen.	6.122831195205433
12601. do you hear me?	8.362335660641696
12602.  you're going to listen!	lord nodded agreeably.	7.593960198743729
12603. he said he wanted very much to listen.	6.6662933901644035
12604. he knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would	be plumb important as well as pleasin' to the ear and he didn't	want to miss a word of it.	5.4382539362181666
12605. so would she mind speaking a little louder?	5.282357243098726
12606. 	i think you stink tom lord! i think you're mean	and hateful and stupid and- louder?	5.2288514545018705
12607.  said joyce.	10.328204514229137
12608. so i can hear you while i'm checkin' the car.	7.267468762822464
12609. looks	like we might be in for a speck of trouble.	5.003636270826092
12610. he opened the	door and got out.	7.513118219918902
12611. he waited at the car side for a moment looking down	at her expectantly.	4.459055404092379
12612. well?	13.921774766768346
12613.  wasn't you goin' to say	somethin'?	5.619635421798327
12614.  then helpfully as she merely stared at him in weary	silence maybe you could write it down for me huh?	5.1764004292255565
12615.  print it	in real big letters an' i can cipher it out later.	4.0683852436856025
12616. aah	go on she said.	8.457718703298294
12617. just go the hell on.	6.91051859712255
12618. he grinned	nodded and walked around to the front of the car.	7.247511793228569
12619. lips pursed mournfully	he stared down at its crazily sagging left side.	4.182602481535312
12620. then he hunkered	down on the heels of his handmade boots peered into the orderly	chaos of axle shock absorber and spring.	5.379573908999286
12621. he went prone on	his stomach the better to pursue his examination.	4.717259433808337
12622. after a time he straightened	again brushing the red permian dust from his hands slapping	it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored twenty-five-dollar	shirt.	5.341445691798986
12623. he wore no gun- a strange ommission for a peace officer	in this country.	4.2508125212824055
12624. never he'd once told joyce had he encountered	any man or situation that called for a gun.	5.862519435723271
12625. and he really feels	that way she thought.	6.150118165944299
12626. that's really all he's got all he is.	6.412214371980113
12627. just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package.	5.11539318794992
12628. if	i could make myself feel the same way h   she studied him	hopefully yearningly; against the limitless background of sky and wasteland	it was easy to confirm her analysis.	4.8523896248050535
12629. here in the god-forsaken	place the westerly end of nowhere tom lord looked almost insignificant	almost contemptible.	4.589671551897791
12630. he was handsome with his coal-black	hair and eyes his fine-chiseled features.	6.4461731809633225
12631. but she'd known	plenty of handsomer guys and conceding his good looks what was there	left?	4.092625935090396
12632.  he wasn't a big man; rather on the medium side.	6.130331029301074
12633. neither	was he very powerful of build.	5.219666477665999
12634. he could move very quickly she knew	but he was more wiry than	truly strong.	6.134994188793196
12635. and his relatively small hands and feet gave him an	almost delicate appearance.	4.276563216066679
12636. just nothing she told herself.	9.483616880284561
12637. just so darned sure of himself that he puts the indian sign on	everyone.	4.429499927024894
12638. but by gosh i want him and i'm going to have him!	he caught her eye came back around the car with the boot-wearer's	teetering half-mincing walk.	5.312472101513641
12639. why did these yokels still wear	boots anyway when most had scarcely sat a horse in years?	4.233408477698615
12640.  he	slid in at her side tucked a cigar into his mouth and politely proffered	one to her.	5.138210239895059
12641. oh cut it out tom! she snapped.	5.518635519134088
12642. can't	you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute?	6.388629868809972
12643. 	this ain't your brand maybe lord suggested.	4.913686410369733
12644. or maybe	you just don't feel like a cigar?	7.519720303892915
12645.    i feel like getting	back to town that's what i feel like! now are you going to take	me or am i supposed to walk?	3.8472414723496096
12646.    might get there faster	walkin' lord drawled seein' as how i got a busted front	spring.	5.5435520024925244
12647. on the other hand howsomever maybe you wouldn't either.	6.008618590594153
12648. i figger it's probl'y a sixty-five-mile walk and i c'n maybe	get this spring patched up in a couple of hours.	5.9785278877073695
12649. how-	with what?	8.12896173865557
12650.  there's nothing out here but rattlesnakes.	7.163184125958424
12651. now ain't it the truth?	6.590362683214186
12652.  lord laughed with secret amusement.	7.712079578137997
12653. not a danged thing but rattlesnakes so i reckon i'll get	the boss rattler to help me.	4.281518876471356
12654. tom! for god's sake!	looky.	8.457718703298294
12655. he pointed cutting her off.	6.494820462377545
12656. see	that wildcat?	11.155741451300253
12657.    she saw it then the distant derrick of the	wildcat- a test well in unexplored country.	4.048164525365109
12658. and even with her limited	knowledge of such things she knew that the car could be repaired	there; sufficiently at least to get them back into town.	5.070272788212666
12659. a wildcatter	had to be prepared for almost any emergency.	4.9042990184703
12660. he had to depend on	himself since he was invariably miles and hours away from others.	6.580869124224131
12661. well let's get going she said impatiently.	5.796618518052249
12662. i-	she broke off frowning.	8.457718703298294
12663. what did you mean by that rattlesnake	gag?	5.753127738673512
12664.  getting the boss rattlesnake to help you?	7.169949744391184
12665.    why	i meant what i said lord declared.	4.913686410369733
12666. what else would i mean	anyways?	9.152339195294
12667.    she looked at him lips compressed.	5.856547304788402
12668. then with	a shrug of pretended indifference she took a compact from her purse	and went through the motions of fixing her make-up.	5.178383229744066
12669. in his mood it	was the best way to handle him; that is to show no curiosity whatsoever.	4.8366235940757125
12670. otherwise she would be baited into a tantrum- teased and provoked	until she lost control of herself and thus lost still another battle	in the maddening struggle of tom lord vs joyce lakewood.	4.704681986780862
12671. the car lurched along at a snail's crawl the left-front mudguard	banging and scraping against the tire occasionally scraping against	the road itself.	3.3635748036442266
12672. lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering	wheel.	6.516515795601384
12673. he seemed very pleased with himself as though some intricate	scheme was working out exactly as he had planned.	4.181057797344569
12674. along with this	self-satisfaction however joyce sensed a growing tension.	7.024572488074501
12675. it poured	out of him like an electric current a feeling that the muscles and	nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action and that that	action would be all that he anticipated.	3.5007571124183388
12676. joyce had seen him like	this once before- more than once actually but on one particularly	memorable occasion.	5.327977609294715
12677. that was the day that he had practically mopped	up the main street of big sands with aaron mcbride field boss	for the highlands oil + gas company.	4.165688369129615
12678. tom had been laying	for aaron mcbride for a long time just waiting to catch him out of	line.	5.8183230155672625
12679. mcbride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with	a pistol on his hip.	3.853623808233391
12680. he had a legitimate reason for wearing it.	8.700089769656477
12681. it	was payday for highlands and he was packing a lot of money back into	the oil fields.	5.058070507211192
12682. moreover as long as the weapon was carried openly	the sheriff's office had made no previous issue of it.	6.330642899329384
12683. so	what's this all about?	6.162967476035402
12684.  he demanded when lord confronted him.	7.5139871259533155
12685. i'm not the only man in town with a gun or the only one without	a permit.	4.879160407174207
12686. it was the wrong thing to say.	9.344628427853173
12687. by failing to do	as he was told instantly- to take out a permit or return the gun to	his car- he had played into lord's hands.	3.5315698359403833
12688. the trouble was	that he had virtually had to protest.	6.0588648589705025
12689. the deputy had forced him to	by his manner of accosting him.	3.78019698820429
12690. so how about it?	10.166650216156253
12691.  he	said.	10.144513917544229
12692. why single me out on this permit deal?	7.439757318826379
12693.    well	i'll tell you about that lord told him.	4.744889304776618
12694. we aim t' be see-lective	y'know?	8.845542587831394
12695.  don't like to bother no one unless we have	to which i figger we do in your case.	3.685338251241182
12696. figger we got to be plumb careful	with any of you highlands big shots.	5.806417005373642
12697. he himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company	but that had nothing to do with him.	5.178418868626686
12698. he was an honest man doing a hard	job and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable.	6.376691281984314
12699. look lord he said hoarsely.	6.82961481427063
12700. i know you've got	a grudge against me and maybe i can't blame you.	6.443708183989294
12701. you think that highlands	swindled you and i helped 'em do it.	5.027298190399355
12702. but you're all wrong	man! i'm no lawyer.	7.343223252109154
12703. i just do what i'm told and-	uh-huh.	6.0046664010044415
12704. an' that could mean trouble with a fella that's	workin' for crooks.	5.739974350684024
12705. so you get rid of that pistol right now mis-ter	mcbride.	5.719375708404074
12706. you do that or take you out a permit right now.	6.633491202417283
12707. mcbride couldn't do either of course.	5.219666477665999
12708. not immediately as the	deputy demanded.	9.408829979339309
12709. not without a face-saving respite of at least a few	minutes.	6.17839070537713
12710. to do so would make his job well-nigh impossible.	8.457650295299043
12711. oil-field	workers were a rough-tough lot.	5.619635421798327
12712. how could he exert authority over	them- make them toe the line as he had to- if he knuckled under to	this small-town clown?	5.575445098159741
12713.    i'll get around to it a little	later he mumbled desperately.	4.317068102383446
12714. just as soon as i go to the bank	and-   huh-uh.	10.48566518092254
12715. now mis-ter mcbride said	lord and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss's arm.	4.342353071861115
12716. it was strictly the deputy's game but mcbride had gone	too far to throw in.	5.7871779040122195
12717. now he could only play the last card in what was	probably the world's coldest deck.	4.261495963591467
12718. he flung off lord's	hand and attempted to push past him inadvertently shoving him into a	storefront.	5.362099888262211
12719. it was practically the last move that mcbride made	of his own volition.	4.461666691279478
12720. lord slugged him in the stomach so hard	that the organ almost pressed against his spine.	5.717847967027684
12721. then as he doubled	gasping vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten lord straightened	him with an uppercut.	3.9714315449334
12722. a rabbit punch redoubled him.	7.5945983638677745
12723. and then	there was a numbing blow to the heart and another gut-flattening blow	to the stomach h   but he couldn't keep up with them.	4.0156160262017115
12724. no	more could he defend himself against them.	6.743273855772659
12725. he seemed to be fighting	not one man but a dozen.	5.948797061048193
12726. and he could no longer think of face-saving	of honor but only of escape.	7.023702677687219
12727. why he's going to kill me	he thought wildly.	5.421199734113007
12728. i meant him no harm.	8.667966011188964
12729. i've given willful hurt	to no man.	5.219666477665999
12730. i was just doing my job just following orders and for	that he's going to kill me.	5.74621650422504
12731. beat me to death in front of a hundred	people.	5.902240026226409
12732. somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was	about to die was the knowledge that lord would probably not suffer for	it: the murder would go unpunished.	4.700123544030288
12733. he mcbride would be cited	as in the wrong and he lord would go scot-free an officer who had	only done his duty though perhaps too energetically.	3.538972580482001
12734. mcbride	staggered into the street flopped sprawling in the stinging dust.	5.9245075971793435
12735. fear-maddened fleeing the lengthening shadow of death he scrambled	to his feet again.	4.0683852436856025
12736. he couldn't see; he was long past the point of	coherent thinking.	5.925879823256658
12737. dimly he heard laughter hoots of derision but	he could not read the racket properly.	3.8849121559715263
12738. he could not grasp that lord	had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago and that his leaden arms were	flailing at nothing but the air.	5.270346723386675
12739. he hated them too much to	understand- the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that	was lord's world.	4.377900306909519
12740. this he was sure was the way they would	act;	laughing at a dying man laughing as a man was beaten to death.	6.087560700530981
12741. and	nothing would be done about it.	6.320906137274908
12742. nothing unless h   donna!	donna his young wife the girl who was both daughter and wife	to him.	5.51796323529772
12743. donna was like he was.	5.619635421798327
12744. she lived by the rules never compromising	never blinded or diverted by circumstance.	6.391566298752792
12745. and donna would-	when he regained consciousness he was in lord's house in	the office of doctor lord the deputy's deceased father.	3.961584153603927
12746. the brannon outfit- known as the slash-b because of its brand-	reached hondo creek before sundown.	5.721042129791549
12747. the herd was watered and	then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's	bedground.	4.400025376149175
12748. two of the new hands a mexican named jose amado and	a kid known only as laredo were picked for the first trick of riding	night herd.	6.221521656760542
12749. the rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and	turned them into the remuda.	4.805958174124232
12750. they got tin cups of coffee from the big	pot on the coosie's fire rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes	lounged about.	5.193016333317527
12751. there was some idle talk a listless discussion of	this or that small happening during the day's drive.	4.157985876683405
12752. but they deliberately	avoided the one subject that had them all curious: the failure	of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit.	5.581336749712354
12753. it especially bothered	the older hands.	6.702258878046396
12754. the cook mateo garcia had arrived	there long before the herd.	5.3669107387724875
12755. he'd started a fire and put coffee on	and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon.	3.6389604595173064
12756. he was readying	a batch of sourdough biscuits for the dutch oven.	6.4461731809633225
12757. supper would be	ready within the hour.	5.219666477665999
12758. the maguire family was setting up a separate	camp nearby.	5.6948717700637985
12759. billie had unhitched the mules from both tom brannon's	and his father's wagon.	4.08482885828587
12760. hank had gathered wood for a cookfire	and his wife was busy at it now.	5.357274857255409
12761. conchita kept an eye on the twins	and little elena trying to keep them from falling into the creek	by which they persisted in playing.	3.8357054050013235
12762. conchita nagged at the younger children	attempting without success to keep her thoughts off tom brannon.	5.2288514545018705
12763. tom brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after	the maguires joined it which had been at midday.	4.205706746744419
12764. he'd come alone	without his wife and child.	7.672172039261195
12765. he'd been in an angry mood: conchita	had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him.	3.7088466436124463
12766. she	wondered what had taken place in town between him and his wife.	5.773838007616824
12767. she	wished that she could talk to her mother about it.	4.474012219159835
12768. not that her mother	knew what had happened but they could speculate upon it.	6.724366435195033
12769. but her	mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it and say that it was none	of her concern.	4.744194744538568
12770. pat get out of that creek! you too sean!	elena you'll get mud all over your dress!   even	as she called to the children conchita let her gaze seek tom brannon.	4.84142631214703
12771. tomas she called him- as the mexican hands did.	4.477601198394805
12772. he was in earnest	conversation with her father and the old vaquero luis hernandez.	7.396626654887625
12773. whatever they are talking about?	6.979959001707671
12774.  conchita wondered.	11.155741451300253
12775. it	bothered her that she probably would never know.	4.6724501027054846
12776. certainly she wouldn't	dare ask her father afterward.	7.759606009049901
12777. he would tell her not to pry into	grownups' affairs- as though she were a little kid like elena!	at the moment the three men were not saying much of anything.	3.6361652969626954
12778. they were sitting on their heels rider-fashion over by the still	empty calf wagon.	6.460016191691707
12779. brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to	the left rear wheel with the other two facing him.	3.9332014440995855
12780. he held a cigarette	in his right hand.	7.042093786547798
12781. it was burning away forgotten.	6.621443529496009
12782. his face was	clouded with unhappiness.	8.575358223828681
12783. he'd told hank maguire and luis	hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what	he now intended to do.	3.5797767497840085
12784. they were considering it gravely neither seeming	to like what he planned.	6.514950565821352
12785. finally hernandez said i could	offer you advice tomas but you wouldn't heed it.	4.341068004551091
12786. wait a little while.	8.457718703298294
12787. let senora	brannon live in her father's house for a time.	5.427145610564027
12788. give her time	to miss you.	8.365282670772114
12789. maybe she will then come to you.	5.606964162165314
12790. after all you want the	senora as much as you want the boy.	7.7978870333818975
12791. you need her even more than you	need him.	6.263831632676857
12792. she won't change her mind brannon said.	7.487284654669317
12793. john clayton will see to that.	6.2907925399463664
12794. but after a time	away from you h.	8.552683581123935
12795. a year luis?	8.40730197610902
12796.  five?	13.921774766768346
12797.  ten?	10.144513917544229
12798.  how	long should i wait?	8.457718703298294
12799.  maybe in a year tomas h.	6.0352481523727795
12800. in a year she'll like living in clayton's house too much to	come back to me brannon said flatly.	5.445281053351629
12801. and the boy will be too	much under his influence by then.	4.871632959276383
12802. i've got to take danny away from	clayton before i lose him altogether.	5.583228874976599
12803. hell in a year or five or ten	the boy will have forgotten me- his own father!   but	to take him and leave his mother behind is not good.	3.4704896159413594
12804. in	my place you'd follow such advice as you give me?	5.9245075971793435
12805.    hernandez	looked suddenly uncertain.	6.939425769494729
12806. that i can't answer for i	can't imagine something like this happening to me.	6.181573153711145
12807. maybe i should	withdraw my advice- no?	6.0352481523727795
12808.    brannon looked at hank maguire.	7.712079578137997
12809. and you?	9.311541102354465
12810.  what would you do in my place?	8.090732169622123
12811.    hank	shook his head.	6.939425769494729
12812. like luis i can't see	something like this happening to me.	6.703604640584531
12813. with maria and me there's never	any problem.	5.6696019761531655
12814. where i go she goes- and the kids with us.	6.7066903006205
12815. you're	going	to need your woman.	6.162967476035402
12816. and the boy will need his mother.	8.339372297787758
12817. if you take	the one you'd better take both.	5.742612297694789
12818. i won't force beth to come against her will.	6.662548872677544
12819. but i'm going	to have my son.	5.7327140783480806
12820. they were silent for a little while each	looking glum.	7.111671096338351
12821. finally luis hernandez said what must be	must be.	5.302604357776418
12822. i am with you of course tomas.	8.136389845597762
12823. and hank maguire	added so am i tom.	5.291537558149789
12824. all right brannon said	rising.	10.050626075778208
12825. we'll ride out as soon as we've had chuck.	5.341889937753466
12826. brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall.	6.748880089634039
12827. they	had for cover both darkness and a summer storm.	4.477601198394805
12828. during much of the	fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the	sky to the east.	5.713776585305186
12829. later they'd heard the rumble of thunder and then	just outside rockfork they ran into rain.	4.161419183037631
12830. those who had slickers	donned them.	10.649227087943386
12831. the others put on old coats or ducking jackets whichever	they carried behind their saddle cantles.	3.6537405674327124
12832. there were seven	of them enough for a show of strength- to run a bluff.	6.618823054646043
12833. it was to	be nothing more than that.	6.5337725345336235
12834. there was to be no gunplay.	12.630246973235892
12835. if the bluff	failed and they ran into trouble brannon had told the others they	would withdraw- and he would come after his son another time.	3.740041844983357

12839. the seventh man was red hogan a wiry little	puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising.	3.390533004331794
12840. they were	all good men.	9.374977878110688
12841. it was dark early because of the storm.	6.511011867810734
12842. also	because of the storm the streets of rockfork were deserted.	6.345535373740035
12843. lighted	windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour.	5.219666477665999
12844. they reined in	before the town marshal's office a box-sized building on main street.	5.718983737256265
12845. a lamp burned inside but brannon peering through the window	saw that the office was empty.	3.9945635752060253
12846. he'd hoped to catch jesse macklin	there.	7.163184125958424
12847. probably just stepped out he said.	5.868354380076001
12848. red come along.	10.988809368554781
12849. the rest of you wait here.	5.904623393132098
12850. with	red hogan he rode to the welcome cafe.	6.412214371980113
12851. hogan got down from	the saddle and had a look inside.	4.317068102383446
12852. not there he said getting back	onto his horse.	7.4429798976160315
12853. maybe he's at the hotel.	6.603380747348814
12854. they rode	to the rockfork house a little farther along the opposite side of	the street.	6.295348995231501
12855. they reined in there brannon remaining in the saddle while	hogan went to look for jesse macklin in the hotel dining room.	3.9450644181988177
12856. he'd put on his old brown corduroy coat and	it was already soaked.	5.583228874976599
12857. but he felt no physical discomfort.	6.598283508998664
12858. he was	only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain.	7.994919937038278
12859. he hardly noticed the blue-green	flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder.	4.083443138568456
12860. hogan	reappeared stopped on the hotel porch lifted a hand in signal.	5.9410768548918345
12861. brannon	dismounted and climbed the steps.	5.619635421798327
12862. he's finished eating	hogan said.	8.457718703298294
12863. sitting with a cup of coffee now.	5.950942605666766
12864. it seemed long at least to tom brannon.	7.744279538396218
12865. he	and hogan waited by the door one to either side.	4.317068102383446
12866. macklin was the	third man to come out and he came unhurriedly.	5.936405630703755
12867. he was puffing on a cigar	and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain.	4.084534063466576
12868. it was	not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them and	then it was too late.	5.45083328252722
12869. they closed in fast kept him from reaching inside	his coat for his gun.	4.167307048760176
12870. just come along brannon told	him.	9.483616880284561
12871. don't start anything you can't finish.	5.219666477665999
12872. we'll talk over at your office.	7.163184125958424
12873. brannon i warn you! let's go marsh	al brannon said and took him by the arm.	4.046392580481968
12874. hogan gripped the	lawman's other arm.	7.712079578137997
12875. they escorted him down from the porch and through	the rain to his office.	4.534485252071911
12876. the other five slash-b men followed them	inside crowding the small room.	5.914401112968634
12877. his face was stiff with anger when	they let go of his arms.	4.502024254548162
12878. he looked at each of them in turn brannon	last of all.	6.5992719371124435
12879. i'll remember you he said.	5.619635421798327
12880. every	last one of you.	8.457718703298294
12881. as for you brannon-   put your gun on	the desk marshal.	5.187830266832177
12882. now hold on damn it; i won't-	red hogan's patience ran out.	6.315833264212564
12883. he lifted the skirt	of macklin's coat took his gun from its holster tossed it onto the	desk.	3.834471933822708
12884. too much fooling around he said.	9.165921136866961
12885. don't press your	luck badge-toter.	6.162967476035402
12886. brannon said now the key to the lockup	marshal.	7.791686979785574
12887. what for?	10.509353167850248
12888. 	can't you guess?	9.52328749892442
12889.  brannon said.	8.12896173865557
12890. we're putting	you where you won't come to harm.	6.412214371980113
12891. get it	out!   damned if i will.	5.781938673331073
12892. brannon you've assaulted a	law officer and-   they moved in on him crowded him from	all sides.	5.2288514545018705
12893. no man laid a hand on him but the threat of violence was	there.	4.554177923754334
12894. his face took on a sudden pallor became beaded with sweat and	he seemed to have trouble with his breathing.	5.606812730618521
12895. he held out a moment	longer then his nerve gave under the pressure.	4.191489551584384
12896. he swore and	said all right.	8.132854117812016
12897. it's here in my pocket.	5.619635421798327
12898. get it out	brannon ordered.	9.595028687531101
12899. then as macklin obeyed: now let's	go out	back.	5.458473417340625
12900. resignedly macklin turned to the back door.	7.486495157400582
12901. they	followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty	feet to the rear.	3.916353768242574
12902. the door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded	with strap iron.	5.176706500854412
12903. it was secured by an oversized padlock.	5.619509663343971
12904. macklin	balked again not wanting to unlock and open the door.	6.338401281426904
12905. they crowded	him in that threatening way once more forced him to give in.	4.167307048760176
12906. once the	door was open they crowded him inside the dark building.	6.520616656965681
12907. he was uttering	threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked	the door.	4.1756694746248115
12908. they returned to the street mounted their horses	rode through the rain to the big house on houston street.	5.833826398956201
12909. its windows	glowed with lamplight.	7.2449808424863535
12910. deputy marshal luke harper still stood	guard on the veranda a forlorn scarecrowish figure in the murky dark.	5.057556181613073
12911. he came to the edge of the veranda peered down at them with his hand	on his gun.	4.852753532421896
12912. don't try it brannon told him dismounting	and starting up the steps with his men following.	5.283880720428394
12913. don't get	yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you.	4.477601198394805
12914. he strode past the now frightened man entered the house.	6.130331029301074
12915. miguel and	arturo ramirez remained on the veranda to keep harper from interfering.	4.217583945709274
12916. the others followed brannon inside.	6.917358910766681
12917. they trailed him across	the wide hallway to the parlor four roughly garbed and tough-looking	men who probably had never before ventured into such a house.	3.53607411832894
12918. they brought	to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves that of their	own sweat of campfire smoke of horses and cattle.	5.134797115929951
12919. they tracked	mud on the oaken floor on the carpet.	4.770496407217191
12920. their presence fouled the elegance	of that room.	7.54538099708796
12921. and their arrival caught john clayton and	charles ansley off guard.	4.735013072267347
12922. the author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing.	7.6648253100250106
12923. for	men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had	received no second.	3.8849121559715263
12924. but the day of the deadline came and passed and	the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction.	6.208297429317392
12925. for	with a single exception nothing had happened to them.	4.477601198394805
12926. the	exception was an iron mountain settler named william lewis.	6.144814417540349
12927. after	walking out to his corral that morning he'd been amazed to see the	dust puff up in front of his feet.	3.982850895446171
12928. a split second later the distant	crack of a rifle had sounded.	5.687349759414254
12929. he'd mounted up immediately and raced	with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the	shot had come.	3.5853166747464886
12930. but he had found all of the thickets and points of	cover deserted.	8.590145746298475
12931. there had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or	trace to show that anyone had been near.	4.803203181623692
12932. lewis was a man who had	made a full-time job of cow stealing.	7.001059201730429
12933. he hadn't even pretended to	be farming his spread.	4.862373123883983
12934. his land had never been plowed.	8.293849980207
12935. he had done	his rustling openly and boasted about it.	5.266637896765785
12936. he had received both first	and second anonymous notices and each time he had accused his neighbors	of writing them.	5.487142527917975
12937. he had cursed at them and threatened them.	5.570660943487726
12938. he was	a man those neighbors testified later who didn't have a friend	in the world.	5.729360182912697
12939. william lewis made the rounds of all who lived	near him again that august morning after a bullet landed at his feet	and once more he accused and threatened everyone.	3.459597083590715
12940. i'll	be ready next time! he raged.	7.163184125958424
12941. i'll be shootin' right back.	5.619635421798327
12942. he had his chance the very next morning for exactly the	same thing happened again.	6.300926504562126
12943. this time lewis had his own rifle in his	hands and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off	shot then spent most of the day searching out the area.	4.224479550062878
12944. he found nothing	but he still refused to give up and move out.	6.656254607131838
12945. just	let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face-to-face!	he exploded.	4.182602481535312
12946. that's all i ask!   he never got that	chance.	6.412214371980113
12947. for the unseen ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the	third time.	4.880043348585167
12948. 30-30 bullet smashed directly into the center of william	lewis' chest.	7.220964481988894
12949. he slumped against a log fence rail then tried	to lift himself.	4.318068015596563
12950. two more shots followed in quick succession dropping	him limp and huddled on the ground.	5.788671488623794
12951. an inquest was held and	after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes the county	coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of	300 yards.	3.92731767282636
12952. rumors of the offer tom horn had made at the stockgrowers'	association meeting had leaked out by then and as a grand jury	investigation of the murder got underway the prosecuting attorney	a colonel baird ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for	questioning.	4.5395763436514045
12953. it took some time to locate horn.	6.217433818312042
12954. he was finally	found in the bates hole region of natrona county two counties	away.	6.035859266067051
12955. prosecutor baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there	after the shooting and began preparing an indictment.	3.744109221929566
12956. but that indictment	was never made.	10.00595935848249
12957. for tom horn it turned out had a number of	rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight	faces that he had been in bates hole the day of the killing.	4.419461575881493
12958. the former scout's alibi couldn't be shaken.	6.674951396177796
12959. the authorities had	to release him.	4.747750369463677
12960. he immediately rode on to cheyenne threw a ten-day	drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends.	5.094863399621238
12961. dead center at three hundred yards that coroner said! he'd	grin.	4.366330104733677
12962. three shots in that fella 'fore he hit the ground! you	reckon there's two men in this state can shoot like that?	5.1073484640840086
12963. 	publicly he denied everything.	6.162967476035402
12964. privately he created and magnified	an image of himself as a hired assassin.	6.02836265013675
12965. for a blood-chilling ring	of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for	the job he'd promised to do.	3.899663503591613
12966. tom horn was soon back at work	giving his secret employers their money's worth.	5.493460696628436
12967. a good many beef-hungry	settlers were accepting the death of william lewis as proof	that the warning notes were not idle threats.	4.231378286421553
12968. the company herds were	being raided less often and cabins and soddies all over the range were	standing deserted.	5.7878930938463435
12969. but there were other homesteaders who passed the	lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing the work of one of his	neighbors.	4.814144901956965
12970. the rustling problem was by no means solved.	6.637996950856203
12971. even	in the very area where the shooting had been done cattle were still	disappearing.	4.223844016478635
12972. for less than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of	the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his	existence might be foreclosed on- a blatant and defiant rustler named	fred powell.	4.8268389407790835
12973. fred was mighty crude about the way he	took in cattle his own hired man andy ross mentioned later.	3.632711015013689
12974. everyone knew it but he sort of acted like he didn't care	who knew it- even after them notes came even after he'd heard about	lewis even after he'd been shot at a couple o' times hisself!	on the morning of september 10 1895 powell and ross	rose at dawn and began their day's work.	4.409003538344407
12975. haying time was close at	hand and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack.	3.7782992462576654
12976. harnessing	a team to a buckboard they drove out to a willow-lined creek	about a half-mile off then climbed down and began chopping.	4.91426761833978
12977. andy	ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the	distant blast of a rifle sounded.	3.632711015013689
12978. he looked around in surprise then	noticed that fred powell was clutching his chest.	5.603512303749962
12979. the hired man	ran over to help his boss.	4.172291832726452
12980. my god i'm shot! powell	gasped.	8.908919080994727
12981. and he collapsed and died instantly.	6.6821221269722
12982. ross had no	intention of searching for the assassin.	6.7247820946899575
12983. he heaved the dead man onto	the buckboard yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast.	3.6606271074526586
12984. but he brought back the sheriff and several deputies and to the lawmen	the entire affair seemed a repetition of the lewis killing.	5.948400571941698
12985. a detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a	ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman's hiding place.	4.368542878155613
12986. there	were no tracks of either hoofs or boots.	6.558975066670428
12987. not even an empty cartridge	case could be found.	5.420563763232115
12988. once again tom horn was the first	and most likely suspect and he was brought in for questioning immediately.	6.10562164598927
12989. once again he shook his head kept his face expressionless and	his voice very calm and had a strongly supported alibi ready.	3.866819087046414
12990. later	riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies	of cheyenne he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations	he made.	4.971118465906416
12991. exterminatin' cow thieves is just a business	proposition with me he'd blandly announce.	4.200729635666694
12992. and i sort o'	got a corner on the market.	7.252810095162937
12993. tom a friend asked him	once how come you bushwhacked them rustlers?	4.221755846421474
12994.  they wouldn't	o' stood no chance with you in a plain straight-out shoot-down.	6.085290683167119
12995. he had lots of friends then as always.	5.570660943487726
12996. even as he became widely	known as a professional killer nearly every cowboy and rancher in	wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend.	5.367391563354149
12997. no man's name brought	more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo.	5.469635549821112
12998. well he	explained	s'posin' you was a nester swingin' the long rope?	6.745914624796776
12999. 	which would you be most scairt of- a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down?	4.171808348396455
13000. 	yeah i can see that the friend was forced to	agree.	7.548352009913953
13001. but h well it just don't seem sportin' somehow!	sportin'! the tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared	in amazement.	4.002885994024083
13002. sportin'! he echoed again in soft wonder.	6.743273855772659
13003. i	seen a lot o' things in my time.	4.6724501027054846
13004. i found a trooper once the apache	had spread-eagled on an ant hill and another time we ran across	some teamsters they'd caught tied upside down on their own wagon wheels	over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o'	their skulls.	4.480274316184266
13005. i heard o' texas cattlemen wrappin' a cow thief up	in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink 'em and squeeze him to	death.	3.6427548853899614
13006. but there's one thing i never seen or heard of one thing	i just don't think there is and that's a sportin' way o' killin'	a man!   after the first two murders the warning notes	were rarely ignored.	5.258576710967233
13007. the lesson had been learned.	4.747652767946212
13008. when fred powell's brother-in-law charlie keane moved	into the dead man's home the anonymous letter writer took no chances	on charlie taking up where fred had left off and wasted no time	on a first notice:   if you don't leave this country	within 3 days your life will be taken the same as powell's was.	4.499863841320971
13009. this was the message found tacked to the cabin door.	5.382661765956409
13010. keane	left within three days.	8.457718703298294
13011. all through albany and laramie counties	other men were doing the same.	4.646432229237472
13012. houses of settlers who'd treated	the company herds as a natural resource free for the taking were	sitting empty with weeds growing high in their yards.	4.836255844532
13013. the small half-heartedly	tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle	than farming were lying fallow.	3.5503993103522
13014. no cow thief could count on a jury	of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer.	5.504583316459943
13015. jury judge and executioner	were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure	that could materialize anywhere at any time to dispense an ancient	brand of justice the men of the new west had believed long outdated.	4.0178919432712945
13016. for three straight years tom horn patrolled the southern wyoming	pastures and how many men he killed after lewis and powell	will never be known.	5.194614673854719
13017. it is possible	although highly doubtful that he killed none at all but merely let	his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder	in the state.	3.671331674702576
13018. it is also possible but equally doubtful that he actually	shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him.	5.687868911826256
13019. for that legend was growing explosively rumor was insisting	he received a price of $600 a man.	4.330867425402809
13020. a monthly wage of about $125 very good money in an era when top	rumor had it he slipped two small	rocks under each victim's head as a sort of trademark.	4.848179826531129
13021. one thing was certain- his method was effective so	effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary.	4.0388036017215745
13022. the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field	glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling	homesteaders out of the upper laramie country in a single week.	5.152559084844773
13023. my reputation's my stock in trade tom mentioned more	than once.	4.846827025659109
13024. he evidently couldn't foresee that it might be his downfall	in the end.	6.488350373852791
13025. he had made himself the personification of the	devil to the homesteaders.	5.297449182518698
13026. but to the cattlemen who had been facing	bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced	with lay-offs a few years earlier he was becoming a vastly different	type of legendary figure.	6.005590500569508
13027. such ranchers as coble and clay and the	bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while	he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown.	3.5156753881856497
13028. he made their	spreads his headquarters and he helped out in their roundups.	6.148544107310267
13029. in the cow camps tom horn was regarded as a hero as the same	kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local	rodeos.	3.8060987110631497
13030. the hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range	waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was	threatening a beloved way of life.	4.6540576823610476
13031. the wailing guitar-strumming minstrels	of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him.	3.700289227276755
13032. by 1898	rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in	wyoming.	6.533928324183597
13033. when several minutes had passed and curt hadn't emerged from	the livery stable brenner reentered the hotel and faced summers across	the counter.	3.716212850671366
13034. i have a little job for you charlie.	8.66381882200372
13035. i'm	sure you won't mind doing me a small favor.	4.650479175492672
13036. brenner's	voice was oily but summers wasn't fooled.	6.743273855772659
13037. he moistened his lips	uneasily.	6.542523493842157
13038. what is it you want me to do mr brenner?	7.789060188329895
13039. 	brenner shrugged carelessly.	6.939425769494729
13040. i just want you to take a message to diane molinari.	7.731143346147504
13041. tell her	to come here to the hotel.	5.255904377056178
13042. vastly relieved summers nodded	and started toward the door.	6.412214371980113
13043. one thing summers brenner	said.	8.500055468609165
13044. you're not to mention my name.	7.843814749904484
13045. tell her curt adams	wants to see her.	4.99123400672534
13046. summers pulled up short and turned around.	6.743273855772659
13047. i don't know mr brenner he said haltingly	beginning to get an inkling of brenner's plans.	4.128667932840525
13048. it doesn't seem	quite right telling her a thing like that.	6.634974012353968
13049. couldn't i just-	his voice trailed off into silence.	4.6724501027054846
13050. brenner continued to smile	but his eyes were cold.	6.585854184058577
13051. he turned and looked around at the lobby	as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed.	4.211703774045652
13052. you know	summers he said thoughtfully.	9.82530560865697
13053. eagle's nest ought to have	a fire company.	4.913686410369733
13054. if someone were to drop a match in here this place	would go up like a haystack.	5.633570373198868
13055. he started toward the stairway then	turned to add tell her to come to adams's room that adams	is in trouble.	3.918222924473144
13056. yes sir.	14.714264832566434
13057. his face	pale summers headed for the street.	5.718796269005698
13058. curt's visit to the	livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching.	5.403764233986132
13059. he paused only long enough to ascertain that jess's buckskin	was still missing and that his own gray was all right then climbed	through a back window and dropped to the ground outside.	3.435206283279722
13060. the	fact that jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate	that diane's information had been wrong but curt didn't interpret	it this way.	5.092532993327829
13061. a man like jess would want to have a ready means	of escape in case it was needed.	4.537647699027721
13062. probably his horse would be close	to where he was hiding.	7.149218899989804
13063. from the back of the barn it was a simple	matter to reach black's house without using the street.	4.985618238474475
13064. curt	approached the place cautiously and watched it several minutes from the	protection of a grove of trees.	5.138210239895059
13065. there was a light in black's	front room but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior.	5.089944630262732
13066. curt circled the house and located a barn out back.	6.627030534611295
13067. he could hear	horses moving around inside and nothing else.	5.229281662197646
13068. there was no lock on the	door only an iron hook which he unfastened.	6.599482943892224
13069. he opened the door and	went in pulling it shut behind him.	4.317735119305145
13070. again he stood in the darkness	listening but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank	floor.	5.8413604855637296
13071. he moved ahead carefully his left hand in front of him	and came to a wooden partition.	5.040245232857971
13072. horse smell was very strong and he could	hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws.	5.096084863704205
13073. he found	a match in his pocket and lit it.	4.645344995261077
13074. there were two horses in	the barn a sway-backed dun and jess crouch's buckskin.	6.606752625563124
13075. curt snuffed	out the match.	6.162967476035402
13076. it was certain now that jess was in the house	but also presumably was stacey black.	6.370225783142086
13077. curt wanted to get jess	alone without interference from anyone even as spineless a person	as the store owner.	3.685338251241182
13078. he studied the problem for a few seconds	and thought of a means by which it might be solved.	6.4178142913422205
13079. reaching across	the side of the stall he slapped the buckskin on the rump.	4.654066945781068
13080. the startled	animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall.	5.1392702945821265
13081. as curt had hoped the house door banged open.	4.970671396152575
13082. he slapped	the buckskin again and it kicked wildly its hoofs rattling the side of	the stall.	5.582838313478957
13083. curt moved over beside the door and waited.	4.6724501027054846
13084. presently	he heard footsteps crossing the yard and jess's smothered curses.	5.9245075971793435
13085. the door swung open and jess said sourly what the hell's	the matter with you?	3.672188800539165
13086.    the horse continued to snort.	7.453498781114289
13087. curt doubted that any animal belonging to jess would find much reassurance	in its owner's voice.	3.8101576301595865
13088. jess cursed again and entered	the barn.	7.163184125958424
13089. a match flared and he reached above his head to light a lantern	which hung from a wire loop.	3.6626960648014135
13090. as he crossed to the side of the	stall curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer.	6.449383775724907
13091. before	you try anything he said.	5.619635421798327
13092. remember what happened to gruller.	9.712033506351291
13093. jess caught his breath in surprise.	5.219666477665999
13094. he started to reach	for his gun but apparently thought better of it.	5.930042996023387
13095. that's	the stuff curt said.	6.162967476035402
13096. just hold it that way.	9.483616880284561
13097. he reached out	to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt.	4.356451057808195
13098. you and	i have a little talking to do jess.	7.266444013636366
13099. you won't be needing this.	7.159500218971222
13100. he moved up and lifted jess's pistol out of its holster.	6.620325684274813
13101. damn you adams- jess was beginning to recover from his initial	shock.	4.487002973744323
13102. we ain't got nothing to talk about.	7.543900632520252
13103. if i don't	come back in the house breed's going to-   your trigger-happy	brother isn't in the house.	5.0530656781924925
13104. about now he's probably	having supper.	9.322278181331564
13105. that long ride the four of you took must've given	him a good appetite.	4.357849039737643
13106. now turn around so i can see your face.	7.148949283587943
13107. there was raw fury in his eyes and the veins of his	neck were swollen.	4.984458818937991
13108. you're about as dumb as they come adams.	6.695856886405094
13109. i don't know what you're up to but when brenner-	you can forget about brenner too curt said.	4.021348168622744
13110. it's	ben arbuckle we're going to talk about.	7.110689923379366
13111. i don't know nothin' about him.	6.0798109377668945
13112. no?	13.921774766768346
13113.  i suppose you don't know anything about a piece of two-by-four	either; one with blood all over it arbuckle's blood.	4.391533194060077
13114. curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun.	6.666093984663209
13115. so help me crouch i'd like to kill you where you stand but	before i do i'm going to hear you admit killing him.	3.6939646197826526
13116. who told you to do it?	8.549389222219014
13117.  was it dutch brenner?	7.952088276389888
13118. 	curt was holding jess's gun in his left hand.	6.144814417540349
13119. he drew back his	arm to slash the gunbarrel across jess's face but didn't finish	the motion.	3.9072530517863884
13120. pistol-whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone	like jess but curt couldn't bring himself to do it.	4.985333447698777
13121. apparently	sensing this and realizing that it gave him an advantage jess	became bold.	4.0683852436856025
13122. having all the guns makes you a big man don't	it adams?	6.2623219190071575
13123.  if we was both armed you wouldn't talk so tough.	5.196251226642256
13124. no?	13.921774766768346
13125.  curt reached out and dropped jess's pistol	back into the holster.	4.317068102383446
13126. he retreated a step and holstered his own.	6.672854314451728
13127. all right crouch; we're on even terms.	5.570692249242327
13128. now draw!	sweat bubbled out on jess's swarthy face.	7.226182303538624
13129. the fingers of	his right hand twisted into a claw but he didn't reach for the gun.	3.5710792731349077
13130. curt angry enough to be a little reckless raised his hands	shoulder high.	6.901734984329663
13131. does this make it any easier coward?	6.064044903027657
13132. 	i ain't drawin' against you jess said thickly.	6.412214371980113
13133. i	heard how you outdrew chico.	5.619635421798327
13134. you're the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind	and hits him with a club.	5.871064097224496
13135. i just wanted to hear you say so.	5.615253055697938
13136. jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his	sides.	5.448482501884564
13137. he had found curt's weakness or what to jess was a weakness	and was smart enough to take advantage of it.	4.239046309836335
13138. somewhere in	the distance a woman screamed.	7.663198664991005
13139. curt was too involved in his own problems	to pay much attention.	4.711877627739328
13140. he had to make jess talk and he had to	do it before stacey black got curious and came to investigate.	6.356286510598431
13141. once	more he lifted jess's gun from its holster only this time he tossed	it into the stall with the frightened buckskin.	3.70684341312732
13142. he dropped his own	beside it.	8.418882486534486
13143. we'll do it another way then he said harshly.	4.610905386661389
13144. jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which	was smashed out of shape by curt's fist.	5.138210239895059
13145. with a roar of pain	and fury jess made his attack.	5.146302487778546
13146. curt managed to duck beneath the	man's flailing fist and drove home a solid left to jess's mid-section.	5.057556181613073
13147. it was like hitting a sack of salt.	5.439968768807612
13148. pain shout up curt's	arm clear to the shoulder but jess seemed hardly aware that he had	been hit.	5.196306408666405
13149. he slammed into the wall bounced back and caught curt with	a roundhouse right which sent him spinning.	3.770206449411329
13150. an inch lower and it	would have knocked him out.	6.661974813187831
13151. as it was his vision blurred and for a moment	he was unable to move.	6.0109298073598705
13152. when his eyes began to focus he saw jess	charging at him with a pitchfork.	6.107827338941698
13153. curt twisted to one side	and the tines of the fork bit into the floor.	3.8849121559715263
13154. jess wasted a few seconds	trying to yank them loose.	6.144814417540349
13155. it gave curt time to stagger to his feet.	5.0579887828786685
13156. the tines broke off under jess's twisting and he swung	the handle in an attempt to knock curt's brains out.	4.715811342704986
13157. his aim was	hurried; so the pitchfork whistled over curt's head.	4.478356756682905
13158. by	now curt was seeing clearly again.	7.163184125958424
13159. he stepped inside jess's guard	and landed two blows to the big man's belly putting everything he	had behind them.	3.8805878084307293
13160. they made jess double over.	8.451230752941052
13161. when his head came down	curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the	wall.	4.260412524815109
13162. the building shook setting the lantern to swaying and	the buckskin to pitching again.	4.983078324342857
13163. even black's old crowbait began	to snort and from the house black yelled jess! what's going	on out there?	4.53530542763648
13164.    jess didn't seem too sure himself.	7.163184125958424
13165. he	lurched drunkenly to his feet lowered his head and took one step away	from the wall.	4.19777029027749
13166. curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which	started at the floor.	5.414009337146035
13167. blood gushed from	his nose and he backed off as rapidly as he could stumbling over his	own feet in his frantic haste to get away from curt's fists.	3.6114526840040995
13168. curt was in almost as bad shape but he wouldn't quit.	5.739974350684024
13169. he backed	jess into a corner grabbed a handful of the man's shirtfront and	drew back his right fist.	4.003947557170506
13170. tell me about arbuckle! you	killed him didn't you?	6.496832096566116
13171.    it was brenner's idea	jess mumbled dabbing at his nose.	5.016127328380636
13172. he found out about you and arbuckle	talking.	7.272169268720427
13173. he wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who	tried to start trouble.	5.040004546578973
13174. you mean anyone who stood up	for his rights curt said.	6.921589851769497
13175. he let go of the shirt and jess slumped	to the floor.	4.318068015596563
13176. turning his back curt crossed to the stall reached	over to untie the buckskin's halter rope and waved his hand in the	animal's face.	5.038596441282696
13177. the buckskin bolted out of the stall.	5.46030906723592
13178. curt	moved in and picked up his gun.	6.743273855772659
13179. he shook loose straw out of the action	and placed the gun in his holster.	4.62937057394378
13180. leaving jess's where it lay	he left the stall.	6.780579305682558
13181. we're going someplace.	6.939425769494729
13182. jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the	door.	6.144968735747789
13183. who's in there?	6.939425769494729
13184.  black called fearfully.	9.725711081064068
13185. curt opened the door grabbed black by the shoulder and pulled him	into the barn.	3.8849121559715263
13186. you're staying right here for a while.	6.743273855772659
13187. this dirty coward just admitted killing arbuckle.	5.071196232108212
13188. i'm going to let	him tell it to somebody else.	6.144814417540349
13189. he shoved black toward the stall	and pointed his pistol at jess.	4.318068015596563
13190. you're	coming along peacefully or i'll put a bullet in your leg.	5.739974350684024
13191. jess stumbled through the door.	5.619635421798327
13192. curt followed reaching behind him	to shut the door and hook it.	5.739974350684024
13193. black would have little trouble getting	out but it might delay him a few minutes.	4.036733669441844
13194. where're you	takin' me?	9.52328749892442
13195.  jess asked worriedly.	6.939425769494729
13196. we're going to	marshal woods's house.	7.712079578137997
13197. maybe if the marshal hears this himself	it'll make a difference.	4.982975454665244
13198. somebody in this town must still have some	backbone.	6.600439951819404
13199. over his shoulder he could see max's loose grin and the burnsides'	glowering faces.	4.5651459199378746
13200. soon as we	send them on their way and make camp let's you and me go for a walk	down by the snake- all by ourselves.	4.917951041323836
13201. sally admonished	her mother you've got all evening to visit with dan.	4.237318715212771
13202. his	wounds need dressing now.	8.457718703298294
13203. mrs jackson's words recalled	dan to his lack of fitness for courting.	4.6767218043617085
13204. what a spectacle he was	caked with dirt and sweat and blood filthy as a pig and naked as an	indian kissing the finest the sweetest the bravest and absolutely	the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world.	4.707639761294058
13205. he released her reluctantly	for her enthusiastic reunion with old hap.	4.467047448170571
13206. got a lot	to tend to but i'll get back quick as i can he assured her.	5.510960742547924
13207. dan could hear clayton burnside and eben jackson summing up	their final reckoning for rental on the oxen.	3.70528032395558
13208. jackson was doing most	of the talking.	7.254556563832127
13209. so long as sally's pa was coming out best on the	haggle dan didn't feel the need of putting in his two-bits'	worth.	4.215271208354074
13210. soon as the burnsides moved on he'd lead rex down by the	river; there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening.	5.564440431086369
13211. damn	it he thought bitterly picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh	bullet hole in the sleeve.	3.897950756933504
13212. if i hadn't got nate stopped when	i did my duds'd all be shot plumb to hell!   he stooped	picked up his ruined hat and pursed his lips thoughtfully.	4.94029226731118
13213. from the	way the wound in his head was itching dan knew that it would heal.	4.661594399799213
13214. but his only	hat was something else again.	8.205846703163663
13215. the burnsides now ready to roll were purposefully deaf to his	cry.	3.78019698820429
13216. nate! he bellowed to the retreating back directly	in front of him.	5.739974350684024
13217. i ain't going to fight you no more.	5.100396573550883
13218. nate turned his head attempting to speak in a soothing voice.	5.739974350684024
13219. i know you ain't! dan affirmed feeling ten feet tall.	5.111103092086215
13220. he moved in close jerked the handsome broad-brimmed beaver hat from	nate's head and clamped it on his own.	5.303618730096964
13221. here's a present for	you he said shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over nate's purpling	forehead.	3.8849121559715263
13222. me and you's trading hats so's you'll have	something permanent to remember me by!   sally left her choring	to stand beside dan.	4.861416487662795
13223. slipping her hand in his they silently watched	the burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight.	3.653575761480384
13224. much as they had to look forward to they didn't begrudge a moment	of the time they spent seeing them go.	6.088049932098439
13225. at first matilda	could not believe her own eyes.	5.8541489168498115
13226. she had spent too many hours looking	ahead hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of dan and finding	nothing but emptiness.	5.362736162658564
13227. and now she could see him looking uncommon	handsome standing there beside sally jackson and her folks in front	of their trail-worn wagon.	3.829600564493055
13228. seeing them waiting there at the	foot of emigrant rock was so overwhelming that for a good minute	after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward	them matilda could not speak at all.	4.5324796585153875
13229. then with a glory that almost	wiped out the deep downward sags in her careworn face matilda leaned	over the wheel and shouted to hez who was stumbling along in the	heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon pa! pa!	i can see dan.	3.510360988557015
13230. and he's with the jacksons!   what	about burnsides?	7.261816056760863
13231.  hez asked who still believed they'd have them	to lick.	4.477601198394805
13232. they ain't even in sight! she replied.	7.2676208602133485
13233. by then hez could see for himself and so could the others.	4.677147614925639
13234. soon they were all shouting greetings exchanging smiles and rejoicing	to think that they were all back together again.	5.894296529157454
13235. but even a reunion	as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day.	4.184673617929242
13236. nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until	they made circle tended the cattle tethered the horses gathered fuel	carried water and started their cooking fires.	4.870300184338658
13237. then and only then	with the jacksons and dan as their true guests of honor did the	harrows take time to catch up on the news.	3.818720209676469
13238. no sooner did they hear	of dan's injury than both gran and matilda went into immediate action.	5.537883980766806
13239. the wound in his scalp was examined pronounced healing and well	doctored with simples before they dished up the victuals.	3.3564050512846006
13240. from then	on in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood	the whole group settled down to relish their food.	5.290657795209691
13241. even sally in	spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome followed the old taboo of quitting	the gab when wearing the nosebag.	3.813110230168741
13242. after their supper	the evening turned into a regular hoe-down.	6.904932903018117
13243. only they	carefully	substituted old country folk dances for the virginia reels and	square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the	great westward migration.	3.6269428039630607
13244. but with bill o'connor on the fiddle	and gran harrow exuberantly shouting glory be and hallelujah	above their united chant of the lilting old ballads they played	their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real	celebration.	4.749456109704635
13245. golly rod exclaimed to harmony as he dutifully	stood by her side among the ringed spectators don't that	fiddle make you wish the bible didn't say us baptists can't dance?	3.305507658629995
13246. 	nor methodists neither she replied.	7.712079578137997
13247. not	that	it matters to me being this far along.	4.6724501027054846
13248. rod gave her a warm	pat on the shoulder before he replied.	5.911336722390717
13249. come spring you'll be	kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too gal.	4.01603703623319
13250. at these words of sympathy and understanding harmony said generously	i don't mind setting here along with gran while you go out and	join in the games.	4.924921875788818
13251. rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling	group out in the circle long enough to reply i ain't much	of a hand for dare-base and farmer-in-the-dell but i'd sure	like to get in on the handhold and wrestles.	3.480240380005727
13252. he looked down at his	big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers.	5.936827783341767
13253. don't reckon there's	nobody out there 'cept maybe dan who can outgrip me harmony.	3.9701983041559052
13254. with rod on his way and matilda visiting with mrs	jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff	harmony settled on the edge of the grub box to ease the pressure	of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs and worried about all that	might have happened to sally.	4.848851693505629
13255. and she was deeply thankful that she	could see her now out there in the midst of a gay youthful circle	skipping and singing farmer in the dell farmer in the dell heigh-ho	the dairy-oh the farmer in the dell.	3.6498169431719556
13256. at the sight	of sally's happy face and carefree expression harmony's dark brooding	eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears.	5.565690844690852
13257. she was glad completely	and unselfishly glad to see that things were working out the right	way for both sally and dan.	4.3137875290904235
13258. h and she really tried to go a step	further and say she hoped they'd be just as right as they now were	for her and for rod.	5.273136606728681
13259. but she couldn't not yet.	6.9042399425482985
13260. not with the memory	of her folks and the lost conestoga still holding her close h.	5.918111651402406
13261. out in the center of the circle the farmer who was dan wasted	no time when they came to the line the farmer choose his wife.	4.70972181635953
13262. with a swift swoop of his big arms he grabbed sally out of the	circle surrounding him and then kissed her soundly before setting her	down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest	of their outfit.	4.554861494147433
13263. soon the child the dog the cat h and even	the cheese all joined them out there in the circle.	4.077963857955642
13264. by now	harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and	resting or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure	of the great cliff towering above them.	5.31250852123594
13265. no matter how many registry	rocks they came to on this journey each one exerted its own appeal.	4.476923158268029
13266. even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization	when stumbled across out here in this wilderness.	5.743946054967284
13267. already	a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at	the register rocks leaving their own records along with those made by	the earlier trains.	3.3515864650355898
13268. soon she saw rod and hez moving over to join them.	6.381796303545958
13269. no sooner were they through and the guards posted than the	whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep.	3.939756964391491
13270. for matilda it	was the first she had known in many a night.	5.957222384759442
13271. even the knowledge that	she was losing another boy as a mother always does when a marriage is	made did not prevent her from having the first carefree dreamless sleep	that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into bear	valley way way back there when they were crossing those other mountains.	3.262762704806036
13272. next morning they moved on again.	8.445886932903889
13273. my souls'	a-gracious! gran harrow exclaimed watching their rippling	muscles as rod and dan swung her up into the load.	3.8535574057241324
13274. a body would	swear i floated right up here on a cloud!   rod and dan	released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged	embarrassed grins.	4.653414193028279
13275. shucks gran they said almost in unison.	4.913686410369733
13276. that	wasn't nothing at all!   leaning forward in her chair	gran nearsightedly scrutinized dan's face.	5.448482501884564
13277. how's sally	like rubbin' agin that thar little ticklebrush ye're a-raising?	4.317068102383446
13278. 	quit ragging him gran rod protested.	7.163184125958424
13279. i	ain't ragging him! gran peered again at the week-old blond	mustache shadowing dan's upper lip.	3.8849121559715263
13280. but honest-to-betsy i've	seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon.	6.137896320336096
13281. the two	tall	brothers waited silently while their mother handed gran her cold	snack and water jug placed the chamber pot beside her feet and returned	to her place at the front of the wagon with alice.	3.5300527605929357
13282. rheumatics	worse pa?	11.155741451300253
13283.  dan asked hez who had limped back from his	team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung	up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends.	3.4414318721041224
13284. my right	leg's stiff as a board this morning he replied.	7.1042273771293045
13285. but the sun'll	fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling.	4.672343651518787
13286. the three	men stepped out to the side to wait for captain clemens' signal.	5.717122444348319
13287. hez looked up at the high face of emigrant rock official signboard	for the raft river turnoff and gloated seems funny that	them burnsides never took time to leave their john-henry up thar.	3.40684085753094
13288. wonder what made them hurry so rod drawled giving	dan a sly wink.	5.583228874976599
13289. dan grinned and changed the subject.	5.279156732537682
13290. from	now on sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it	comes up and fall in behind you and rod's outfit.	4.878301053475763
13291. ain't	no sense you eating our dust rod protested.	4.6724501027054846
13292. sally	and her ma want to trade off on account of harmony being so far along	dan explained.	5.266085024689841
13293. jackson recruited his critters and him and	me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up.	3.733208489827465
13294. he's	got the tightest running gear in the train now.	6.144814417540349
13295. besides 'tain't	no more'n right for me to follow with my black oxen so's i can	unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch.	3.536377362815695
13296. captain	clemens' signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting	teams.	5.9245075971793435
13297. reckon ye're right dan hez called back over	his shoulder.	4.477601198394805
13298. i'll shore be needing ye both on the pull out o'	the canyon.	5.583228874976599
13299. rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing	precipice-walled gorge.	4.6724501027054846
13300. we'll double teams zigzagging up the	mountain harmony he spoke reassuringly concerned by the pinched	look around her mouth.	5.195250538177667
13301. like enough we'll all be up on top by	sundown.	5.114803304993459
13302. out of the corner of his eye he could see his father's	wheels beginning to turn.	6.874250436837257
13303. before harmony had a chance	to reply rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen's backs h.	4.024548572942232
13304. while no larger than dutch springs this mining supply town had	the	appearance of being far busier and more prosperous.	5.419868351518056
13305. men crowded the streets	and freight rigs and teams were moving about.	4.492996202193176
13306. although they were	forced to maintain a sharper watch this activity enabled them to ride	in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid	them.	5.2123347117494285
13307. gyp'll be holdin' forth in some bar if he's	here at all cobb declared glancing along the street as they stretched	their legs.	3.5033994744337345
13308. there were no less than six or seven saloons	in ganado not counting the lower class dives all vying for the trade	of celebrating miners and teamsters.	5.547430629492713
13309. take one	side of the street and i'll take the other he proposed.	4.645100831080944
13310. if	you spot carmer give a yell before you move in.	6.209185128670512
13311. you do the same.	8.083515243458141
13312. it's all i ask stevens.	7.9749102302919095
13313. separating they took different sides of the main drag and	systematically combed the bars.	4.90433558020345
13314. russ visited two places without result	and his blood pressure was down to zero.	5.448482501884564
13315. suddenly it seemed to him	insane that they might hope to locate gyp carmer so casually even were	he to prove the thief.	3.9390537335361837
13316. he tramped out of the miners rest with his	hopes plummeting and headed doggedly for the palace saloon the	last place of any consequence on this side of the street.	5.573764631322354
13317. the	palace was an elaborate establishment built practically on stilts in	front with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch.	3.8449706550168816
13318. behind	its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest	to the rocky ribs of the canyonside.	5.057556181613073
13319. russ ran up the steps quickly to	the plank porch.	4.477601198394805
13320. the front windows of the place were long and narrow	reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of	the interior.	5.063209338716277
13321. heading for the batwings cobb glanced perfunctorily	through the nearest window and suddenly dodged aside.	3.8849121559715263
13322. nerves tight as	a bowstring he paused to gather his wits.	6.01282703834134
13323. against all expectation	carmer was inside clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already	so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything	or anyone about him.	3.6050617625404593
13324. fierce anger surged through russ.	7.712079578137997
13325. he fought	down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot.	3.9072530517863884
13326. reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows he	feverishly scanned the busy street below.	6.018658250236674
13327. stevens was nowhere in sight.	5.619635421798327
13328. muffling an exclamation russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran	down.	5.739974350684024
13329. as luck had it he had not gone twenty feet in the street before	pat appeared.	4.59304167358527
13330. what luck cobb?	11.868433137946862
13331.  he said swiftly.	9.891955342765252
13332. he's there he got out tersely	curbing his rising excitement.	6.144814417540349
13333. hitching his cartridge belt around pat	glanced upward briefly at the palace and started that way with cobb	at his side.	3.8384449993266805
13334. climbing the steps steadily they reached the	top and headed for the door.	6.001380796309728
13335. forced behind	him momentarily russ followed at once and halted two steps inside.	4.330354631341569
13336. while five minutes ago the place had presented a scene	of easy revelry with gyp carmer a prominent figure it was now	as somnolent and dull as the day before payday.	4.815328357871141
13337. carmer himself was nowhere	to be seen.	5.219666477665999
13338. a man knocked the roulette ball about idly	in its track and another dozed at one of the card tables.	6.001842567681961
13339. two men murmured	with their heads together at the end of the bar while the sleek-headed	bartender absently polished a glass.	4.859537525719895
13340. looking the setup over	stevens started coolly for the rear of the place.	5.838445422304377
13341. where yuh	goin'?	10.928111489282717
13342.    it was the barkeep.	12.203349448846424
13343. halting pat turned to	survey him deliberately.	5.219666477665999
13344. he did not reply going on toward the back.	8.146492048023378
13345. less	assured than the tall wide-shouldered man in the lead cobb followed	alertly a hand on his gun butt.	4.143886650055288
13346. the bartender measured this situation	with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it.	4.98858422518456
13347. a hall opened in back of the bar running toward an ell.	4.724834108007236
13348. small rooms probably for cards opened off on	either	side.	7.023361433266075
13349. all the doors were open at this hour except one and it was	toward this that stevens made his way with russ close at his shoulder.	3.807636107785963
13350. a single kick made it spring open	shuddering.	6.65458803126507
13351. pat saw gyp carmer staggering forward a half-filled bottle	upraised	as if to strike.	4.0683852436856025
13352. russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside.	6.412214371980113
13353. with a bellow carmer lunged at him.	6.145039589833311
13354. but he was more than half-drunk	and his faculties were dulled.	8.29568879488557
13355. cobb unleashed a single powerful jab	that sent gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan.	3.7218274806039835
13356. he started to struggle up heaving desperately.	7.361049848111887
13357. russ gave him a brutal	thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach.	4.08362597773641
13358. kneeling cobb	planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back holding him pinned.	6.108835496511997
13359. i've drawn his fangs he snapped.	5.219666477665999
13360. go	through his pockets will you?	7.712079578137997
13361.  if we have to we'll take him apart	and see what he's made of!   complying methodically	pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing.	3.9440952277608767
13362. cobb	watched this with hunted eyes his desperate hope waning by the moment.	5.583228874976599
13363. stevens was grunting over the last empty pocket when russ abruptly	rose and lunged toward carmer's hat which had tumbled half-a-dozen	feet away when he first fell.	3.492555296231708
13364. straightening up his	eyes ablaze he held out the battered stetson.	5.961443656333938
13365. look at	this!   inside the crown stuffed behind the stained sweatband	could be seen thin crumpled wads of currency.	4.0065654500494565
13366. carmer's ingenious	cache for his loot had been found.	6.412214371980113
13367. by golly stevens!	you were right russ exclaimed tearing the loose bills out	of carmer's hat.	4.1748144736617245
13368. that is if we can be sure this is colcord's	money-   pat grunted.	6.692691789015274
13369. where else would he get it?	6.2337413162962925
13370.  count	what you've got there cobb.	7.712079578137997
13371. russ	ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any	cowpuncher would come by honestly.	3.685338251241182
13372. it's within a	hundred of what crip had he declared.	6.144814417540349
13373. we know penny spent some-	and carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on.	4.287871998590153
13374. handing the money over russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs	as if ridding himself of something unclean.	5.057556181613073
13375. his glance at gyp	carmer was disdainful.	5.494705956727202
13376. shall we get out of here?	8.21849764103945
13377.    leaving	the card room they moved back through the palace the way they	had come.	4.102018207732472
13378. glowering looks met them in the bar but there was no attempt	to halt them.	6.9942872025417
13379. pausing in the outside door to glance behind him pat	looked his unspoken warning and stepped out.	3.744109221929566
13380. he and cobb clattered	down the high steps to the street.	6.590753475706068
13381. neither spoke till they reached	their horses.	6.130465511292824
13382. pat paused there looking across at the young fellow.	6.144814417540349
13383. it'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to colcord	and tell him about it russ.	3.889475054166871
13384. he started to return it.	8.584047796631117
13385. to	his faint surprise russ held up his hand.	4.6724501027054846
13386. not me he ruled decidedly.	9.408829979339309
13387. it was you that tracked it down anyway stevens	he pursued strictly.	4.615229625673583
13388. whatever you say.	11.641345393870475
13389. pat swung into the saddle yet still he delayed	his brows puckered.	4.182602481535312
13390. you owe it to penny to give her a chance	to explain that she was defending you really he observed mildly.	5.850793632185567
13391. old crip wasn't retorted cobb tartly.	5.914135863919039
13392. he'll	know when you tell him.	7.712079578137997
13393. but i want this to sink in awhile.	5.760009726786038
13394. then maybe	next time he won't be so quick on the trigger.	6.2044028944784575
13395. pat	had never pretended to give advice in such affairs.	4.477601198394805
13396. you're the	doctor he returned with a smile.	6.743273855772659
13397. but i still think penny's	an awful nice girl russ-   you don't have to tell	me flashed cobb.	4.594721091511218
13398. giving the other a dark look he hauled his bronc	around and trotted down off the street.	5.174582949257715
13399. pat let him go following	more leisurely.	5.318957284914478
13400. at the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in	for his dinner and as a consequence did not see cobb strike the open	range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells	for antler.	5.177783777543667
13401. the truth was the puncher was both bewildered	and dismayed by his own mixed luck.	4.261002074797509
13402. penny's always glad to see me	over there he mused bleakly.	6.177253783597983
13403. yet had he not visited the girl at	saw buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle.	4.430207545829318
13404. over and above that however was his growing suspicion of chuck	stober's part in recent events.	5.875755642409715
13405. gyp carmer couldn't have	known about colcord's money unless he was told- and who else would	have told him?	3.685338251241182
13406.  he asked himself.	12.430810852337384
13407. it's the second time war	ax hands made a play for that money.	4.288315614529267
13408. how much of an accident	could that be?	8.965607398190274
13409.    nearing home he jerked to attention at	the distant crack of a gun.	4.0683852436856025
13410. in town no one paid much attention to an	occasional shot; but on the range gunfire had a meaning.	5.76760687202144
13411. hauling up	russ listened carefully.	6.162967476035402
13412. two minutes later it came again- a double	explosion followed by a third sounding more distant.	6.2426041842666224
13413. as near	as cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the	antler ranch house.	4.878613310536152
13414. he tightened up in a twinkling.	8.82762730024785
13415. so far as he knew	only his father could be there.	5.666023477764051
13416. what did it mean?	10.500636510718293
13417.  clapping spurs	to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter with growing alarm.	4.112934551791357
13418. his first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells	told	him nothing.	6.162614878084655
13419. still a quarter-mile away the fresh clap of guns only served	to increase his speed.	4.379504796432022
13420. setting a course straight for the house	he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his	face.	4.978493232972893
13421. when it was followed by a second whining even closer	cobb	swerved sharply aside into a depression.	5.361974104483004
13422. he knew now what he was	up against.	7.8220423312603495
13423. whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging	the antler house and having spotted his approach was determined	to drive him off before he could get into the fight.	3.71056140291682
13424. cursing	himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in	his saddle boot russ drew his colt and examined it briefly.	4.977211564565436
13425. if he	wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested	he had his answer a moment later.	3.9910520837804158
13426. over this way! he ain't	gone far! a harsh cry floated to him across the brush.	5.760991507531547
13427. a carbine cracked more loudly and a slug clipped fragments from the	brush off at one side.	3.7183348621206807
13428. the would-be assassin had his position figured	pretty close.	5.650577481330174
13429. dismounting russ looked about hastily.	5.619635421798327
13430. toward the	west this depression led toward a draw.	6.5057437466360915
13431. leading his pony he hurried	that way not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding	range.	4.281245464764199
13432. swinging up then and bending forward over the	horn he urged his mount down the meandering draw.	5.138210239895059
13433. he had not covered	a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind.	4.632271001994906
13434. he had	been sighted and his attacker pumping shot after shot.	6.130331029301074
13435. a shot or two	went wild before cobb felt something tug at his foot.	3.9380144034314593
13436. a slug had torn	half of his stirrup-guard away.	6.338814096168618
13437. a second twitched his shirtsleeve	and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm.	4.263830406445439
13438. jumping jerusalem! let's get out of here!	at the first shot russ had hurled his mount to the left toward	the side of the winding draw.	5.529654720466859
13439. the long minute before he reached effective	cover seemed endless.	4.4795189253574845
13440. sweeping a look around he saw that he	was safe for the moment.	5.786128425089719
13441. he heard cries from behind him but he could	make out no words.	4.191489551584384
13442. he dashed madly for the next elbow turn in	the draw and made it.	6.225744741384857
13443. recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an	intersecting draw he plunged forward with undiminished speed.	3.8849121559715263
13444. gradually	the wash climbed upward forcing him toward open range.	6.144814417540349
13445. yet he must	chance it.	7.661703654748841
13446. he clambered out of the dwindling wash the loose dirt	flying behind him and flashed a look about.	5.877656618380542
13447. early in november the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned	missions.	4.9323206596212295
13448. and sweeney squadron put its first marks on the combat	record.	6.54347385566233
13449. every plane that could fly was sent into the air.	4.957433799471091
13450. cricket took eight ships and went south across the straits and along	the north coast of mindanao to cagayan.	4.985333447698777
13451. anything the enemy flew	or floated was his target.	4.6724501027054846
13452. fleischman with eight was to patrol the leyte	gulf area with his main task to get any kamikaze before they	got to the ships.	4.758972536424235
13453. greg himself took two flights with todman leading	the second to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around	ormoc on the east coast of leyte.	3.7191090875948807
13454. each plane carried two five-hundred	pound bombs.	8.190897663347755
13455. a weapons carrier took greg todman belton	banjo ferguson and walters and the others the two miles from the	bivouac area to the strip.	3.656227948657063
13456. it was a rough long ride through the mud	and pot holes.	6.847100351985135
13457. no one had much to say.	6.991964807378226
13458. the sky glowered down at them.	6.154258638774449
13459. there was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the	others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever.	3.9432630488891234
13460. the truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread	through the jungle.	5.078074081494962
13461. donovan snatched greg's chute from him with	a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it.	3.908919954055539
13462. his face was	dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his	pilot.	5.7994746671048665
13463. greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been	in one before.	4.857029952775393
13464. but his hands and those of donovan moved automatically	adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure.	6.558526269242143
13465. i've	got her as neat as i can donovan said as he dropped the straps	of the seton harness over greg's shoulders.	3.7866530698945904
13466. it's for carabao not airplanes.	7.712079578137997
13467. don't you worry chief greg replied wondering if he himself	believed it.	4.182602481535312
13468. see you donovan said as he jumped	off the wing.	6.898168496567185
13469. the expression was his trade-mark his open sesame to	good luck and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return.	3.3523030750764407
13470. at the prearranged time greg started the engine and taxied out.	6.993803233644775
13471. from	the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight	he knew donovan would keep his back to the strip.	4.339689541427196
13472. he wondered where	the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief	to watch his plane take off on a combat mission.	5.2709778703077195
13473. yet long before the	scheduled time for return donovan would be watching for every speck	in the sky.	4.011603446828087
13474. greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip and	one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him.	4.991331989469629
13475. the dark	brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful.	3.78019698820429
13476. the	pilots' heads looked ridiculously small.	7.712079578137997
13477. the control tower gave him	immediate take-off permission and the clean roar of the engine that	took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of donovan.	3.312254840763388
13478. greg's mission was the last to leave and as he circled the ships	off tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again.	5.314128392420699
13479. to the west	the dark green hills of leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway	up their slopes.	4.367473345930089
13480. underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray.	5.9977222407975725
13481. water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and	out of showers.	4.11003826812812
13482. the metal strip they had taken off from was coal black	against the green jungle around it.	4.762782422141702
13483. he possessed the fighter pilot's	horror of bad weather and instrument flying and he wondered if	the ceiling did drop whether he and the other flights would be able to	find their way back in this unfamiliar territory.	3.44562567707882
13484. he shivered in the	warm cockpit.	8.132854117812016
13485. the overcast was solid above him.	4.484773325250435
13486. as far as he	could see there was no hole to climb through it.	7.576981961191564
13487. they would have to	go west through the narrow river valley that separated leyte from samar	and hope that it didn't close in before they returned.	3.923862433044436
13488. greg	pushed the radio button on his throttle.	6.743273855772659
13489. todman let's try	to go under this stuff.	4.913686410369733
13490. stay in close and we'll go up the valley.	6.144814417540349
13491. roger sweeney todman called back and pulled his four	in and slightly above greg.	3.9701983041559052
13492. greg took the formation wide	around three a-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the gulf.	5.193373684214774
13493. he dropped down to five hundred feet swinging a little north of	the city of tacloban and punched into the opening that showed against	the mountain.	3.482573561573817
13494. the valley was only a few hundred yards wide	with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree	turn.	6.030277122239876
13495. it was only a fifteen-minute flight but before it was	through greg felt	himself developing a case of claustrophobia.	4.45287880246033
13496. the ceiling	stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet and at times	the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in.	4.658066095918475
13497. if the other pilots were worried	they did not show it.	4.86061928451775
13498. when the sea was visible ahead of them the relief was as great as if	the sun had come out.	5.785656738220325
13499. he spread the flight out and led them across a	point of land and then down the coast.	4.027878266537337
13500. although they drew light ground	fire they saw no signs of activity.	6.639889318338897
13501. once todman thought he	had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while greg covered him.	4.241463924893432
13502. somebody beat us to it! todman said over the radio as he	came back up in formation.	5.180981044750343
13503. visibility continued to be limited	and greg was never able to get above a thousand feet.	4.237957536170638
13504. his earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts	made by other flights.	5.773263635410079
13505. he thought once that he identified the somewhat	hysterical voice of fleischman claiming a kill.	3.986683685066709
13506. but greg's	area remained as placid as a florida dawn.	6.60434795749222
13507. finally as time	began to run out he headed into ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses	that intelligence had thought might contain japanese supplies.	4.024356082515299
13508. the low clouds made bombing difficult.	6.1544293522411175
13509. there was not enough room to	make the usual vertical bomb run.	4.936361561065968
13510. one	of greg's bombs hung up and he was miles from the target before he	could get rid of it.	6.201254804454002
13511. only one of the flight scored a direct hit and	the rest blew up jungle.	5.360754531089547
13512. with their load of bombs gone the planes	moved swiftly and easily.	6.728299175375886
13513. greg went up tight against the ceiling	and led them back to their pass to home.	4.02620777295836
13514. mercifully it was still open.	8.655602611112975
13515. like a man making a deep dive greg took full breath and plunged	back into the valley.	4.160708577588333
13516. he was about to make a gas check on his flight	when todman's voice broke in: sweeneys! three bogies.	6.4094086154999586
13517. greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument	panel.	4.913686410369733
13518. he saw them specks against the gray but closing fast.	6.3439745077144325
13519. they were headed straight for each other on a collision course.	4.747311876130074
13520. friend	or enemy?	11.155741451300253
13521.  the same old question.	6.39399346515341
13522. and only a few seconds to answer	it.	8.78747287943686
13523. zeros! todman said excitedly and hopefully.	5.219666477665999
13524. and then he thought todman might be right.	8.362739176281822
13525. his mind flicked	through the mental pictures he had from the hours of aircraft identification.	3.9967040834155467
13526. he narrowed the shape down to two: either a zero or a u	s navy type aircraft.	5.262523355804097
13527. if it were the enemy tactically	his position was correct.	6.401590746623039
13528. japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability	american on speed and firepower.	5.982853677392812
13529. his present maximum altitude	up against the overcast gave him the opportunity to exploit his	advantages.	4.72602322770701
13530. but it also made him conspicuous to the enemy if it was	the enemy and he hadn't been spotted already.	5.7580003199971355
13531. but the closing aircraft	showed no sign of deviating from their original course.	4.513274286890109
13532. in	seconds greg made his decision.	7.712079578137997
13533. he pushed the radio button.	5.926245264679889
13534. sweeney blue hit the deck.	7.712079578137997
13535. todman you take	the one on the left.	4.913686410369733
13536. belton the one on the	right.	7.712079578137997
13537. if h if they're japs.	6.764943127894517
13538. greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two	rogers.	5.472986659006709
13539. the planes light with most of the gas burned	out responded beautifully.	4.518380716105367
13540. greg's airspeed indicator was over 350	when he leveled off just above the trees.	5.448482501884564
13541. the opposing aircraft continued	to come on.	4.484773325250435
13542. they appeared to be the enemy.	11.323272711181174
13543. greg wished the air	corps had continued to camouflage planes.	4.477601198394805
13544. there was of course no	way for the other planes to get by them.	6.881418745315045
13545. but they could	turn and escape to the east.	5.714572066738885
13546. greg pushed the radio button again.	7.163184125958424
13547. todman drop your second element back.	5.219666477665999
13548. if any of us miss they	can pick up the pieces.	8.408616369028447
13549. now let's make sure they're japs.	6.02453886563994
13550. even as he said it greg knew they had found the enemy.	6.798657344224609
13551. the	shapes were unmistakable and the rising suns were showing up slightly	brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom.	3.744109221929566
13552. greg slapped his hand	across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight.	5.057556181613073
13553. the circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector	glass in front of him.	4.184740414395503
13554. arm your guns sweeneys.	8.605779703196038
13555. they're japs came a high-pitched	voice.	5.619635421798327
13556. one pass only.	11.575447626174114
13557. you'll bust your ass in this canyon.	4.913686410369733
13558. he moved the flights over against one wall.	6.888679709401048
13559. it gave them	all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away	that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery.	4.068542268442658
13560. if the turn was too tight a barrel roll would bring them out.	6.011145596926475
13561. a hell of an altitude for a barrel roll but it could be done.	4.484941836808471
13562. greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the rpm	and the engine responded as if it had been waiting.	5.652280261282459
13563. the clearly	identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around.	3.743597065805899
13564. they	haven't seen us greg yelled to himself over the engine noise.	5.739974350684024
13565. he hit the radio button.	6.171414230641754
13566. let's take 'em home.	8.457718703298294
13567. he hauled back on the	stick and felt his cheeks sag.	4.467047448170571
13568. out of the corner of his eye he watched	his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him.	6.076430796190442
13569. with the rapid rate of closure the approach from below	the side and ahead there would be only a moment when damage could	be done.	4.272728644537922
13570. just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer	from a diving board.	6.07416363764249
13571. his nose up.	7.467635474117327
13572. it	was going to be dangerous.	10.992082965110846
13573. eight aircraft in this small box.	6.049295116153139
13574. please	dear god make my pilots good he prayed.	6.412214371980113
13575. he took a lead on	the enemy using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight	and then added another.	4.013025139540334
13576. the enemy did not veer.	6.917601433173219
13577. it did not seem possible	that they hadn't been spotted.	5.436653519637415
13578. now!	greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger.	6.743273855772659
13579. the plane rumbled	and slowed.	6.084262384804493
13580. six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished.	6.9575234705142055
13581. as if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them.	5.093446725918319
13582. greg tightened his	turn until the plane shuddered.	6.743273855772659
13583. his burst held	for a second on the engine section of the plane.	5.068720446265494
13584. the jap's propeller	flew off in pieces.	6.154713990487742
13585. a large piece of engine cowling vanished.	5.516488453888989
13586. it	was all greg had time to see.	8.122193935480691
13587. his maneuvering for the shot had placed	him near the overcast almost inverted and heading up into the clouds.	3.7185017350178105
13588. his speed was dropping rapidly.	8.16490567933018
13589. if he spun out now he would join	his opponent on the ground.	4.810590885227843
13590. wingman stay clear he prayed.	7.712079578137997
13591. he	pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back.	4.182602481535312
13592. he fought	the panic of vertigo.	8.132854117812016
13593. he had no idea which was up and which was	down.	5.749619146932194
13594. he held the controls where they had been.	7.5248512936049305
13595. sweat popped out over	him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip.	3.744109221929566
13596. his	air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out.	6.106219783193934
13597. over the rattling of fenders humming of tires and chattering	of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles.	4.175051050594898
13598. cool	air moving slowly through the open or smashed-out side windows hinted	of blooming roadside vegetation and occasionally a faint fragrance	of perfume swirled from the back seat.	4.63479892887524
13599. moriarty my driver	suddenly exclaimed with something so definite so final in his tone	i	once more repeated the absurdity mustering all my latent powers of	hypocrisy to sound convinced.	3.3515864650355898
13600. we were coming to an intersection	turning right chuffing to a stop.	6.703232231793325
13601. forced to realize that	this was the end of a very short line i scanned a road marker and discovered	what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old	mexican: moriarty new mexico.	4.109500007833355
13602. adios i	said exhausting my spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one	of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host's daughters.	4.807873378411027
13603. i	waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading	through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass.	3.5847229490508448
13604. then	i saw the father's head slightly turn; gauche rainbow shapes replaced	the poignant ovals of gold.	5.2288514545018705
13605. white-shirted	and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward	the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze.	3.8101576301595865
13606. suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled and thumbing hopefully	i saw emergent in windshield flash: red lips streaming silk	of blonde hair and- ah trembling confusion of hope apprehension	despair- the leering face of old herry.	4.568925146937507
13607. mor-ee-air-teeeee	he shrieked his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of	the glittering blonde.	4.182602481535312
13608. over the rapidly-diminishing outline of	a jump seat piled high with luggage herry's black brushcut was just	discernible near or enviably near that spot where- hidden- more	delicately-textured most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming	back in cool oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca	flowers and engine fumes.	4.390549440666843
13609. i would have foregone	my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty	and- well at least i wouldn't have shouted back a taunt.	3.9786821165779553
13610. still nursing anger i listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly	approaching its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me.	5.480074734454919
13611. just as i straightened up with my duffel bag i heard: sahjunt	yoorick meet mrs major j a roebuck.	4.085900022358541
13612. the	voice	was that of johnson tail gunner off another crew.	6.144814417540349
13613. squeezing	a look between johnson's fat jowls and the car frame a handsome	and still darkhaired lady inquired y'all drahve?	3.716289176231236
13614.    i	nodded.	13.921774766768346
13615. onleh one thiihng mrs roebuck continued.	5.219666477665999
13616. ahm goin nawth t'jawn mah husbun in sante fe an y'all maht	prefuh the suhthuhn rewt.	5.2288514545018705
13617. but corporal johnson has alreadeh said it	didn make no diffrunce t'hi-im.	4.452373707595423
13618. i said that it didn't	make any difference to me either as far as i knew.	6.78544799135754
13619. how far	i knew will shortly become apparent.	5.745143486080852
13620. let me pass over the trip to sante	fe with something of the same speed which made mrs roebuck	wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit is still	in ee-faket.	5.680956957720688
13621. i let up on the accelerator only to gradually	reach again the 60 mph which would i hoped overhaul herry	and the blonde and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had	something more important to catch than had i mrs major roebuck	settled down to practicing on corporal johnson the kittenish wiles	she would need when making her duty call on colonel and mrs somebody	in sante fe.	3.131501634127821
13622. when johnson ejaculated howsabout my	buying us all a nice cold co-cola ma'am?	6.122129252760278
13623.  mrs roebuck smilingly	declined and began suddenly to go on about her son who was onleh	a little younguh than you bawhs.	3.986613581853446
13624. johnson never would	have believed she had a son that age.	6.153950333335566
13625. mrs roebuck thought johnson	was a sweet bawh t'lah lahk thet but her herman was getting	to be a man there was no getting around it.	3.903671117565513
13626. just befoh he left	foh his academeh we wuh hevin dack-rihs on the vuhranduh major roebuck	an ah an huhmun says 'may ah hev one too'?	4.994017182277632
13627.  just as	p'lite an- an cohnfidunt an ah says 'uh coahse you cain't'	but he says 'whah nawt you ah hevin one'?	3.8280306435389444
13628.  an ah coudn ansuh	him an so ah said 'aw right ah gay-ess an his fathuh didn uttuh	one wohd an aftuh huhmun was gone the majuh laughed an tole me	thet he an the bawh had been hevin an occasional drink t'gethuh f'ovuh	a yeah onleh an occasional one but just the same it was behahn	mah back an ah doan think thet's nahce at all d'you?	4.134461923336878
13629. 	no i don't johnson said.	5.619635421798327
13630. i'm a good baptist	and drinking h	mrs roebuck very kindly let me drive	through sante fe to a road which would she said lead us to taos	and then raton and eventshahleh out of new mexico.	4.49910027002532
13631. how lightly	her eventshah-leh passed into the crannies where i was storing	dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus and how the word	would echo.	3.704878641657836
13632. hardly had mrs roebuck driven	off when a rusty pick-up truck father or grandfather of senor	moriarty's ford sedan came screeching to a dust-swirling stop	and a brown face appeared its nose threatened by shards of what	had once been the side window.	4.401362741617513
13633. the straight black hair flopped in a vigorous nod the slender nose	plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back.	3.3564185518874785
13634. johnson unwired	the right hand door whose window was like the left one merely loosely-taped	fragments of glass and johnson wadded himself into a narrow	seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer.	4.498917262510585
13635. in	back buddy the driver said to me.	4.913686410369733
13636. quickly but carefully	lowering my duffel bag over the low side-rack i stepped on the running	board; it flopped down sprang back up and gouged my shin.	4.815973307801501
13637. the truck	was hurtling forward.	5.098202453568707
13638. i seized the rack and made a western-style	flying-mount just in time one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel	bag- and merely wrecking my camera i was to discover later-	my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and- but this	is no medical report.	4.580855444068392
13639. i was again in motion and at a speed	which belied the truck's similarity to senor x's ford turtle.	4.2325546532939535
13640. maybe i would beat old herry to siberia after all.	6.571880739425066
13641. whatever satisfaction	that might offer.	7.346899857705098
13642. i	drew back drawing back my foot for a kick.	6.144814417540349
13643. but it was only johnson	reaching around the wire chicken fencing which half covered the truck	cab's glassless rear window.	4.6831761260644305
13644. the way his red rubber lips were stretched	across his pearly little teeth i though he was only having a	little joke but no he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind	so he could roar something into my ear.	4.634526383266239
13645. wanna beer?	8.12896173865557
13646. 	hell yes i roared back between dusty lips.	6.412214371980113
13647. did i	want a beer?	7.19885334902355
13648.  did an anteater want ants?	8.854170950630545
13649.    bueno amigo.	8.12896173865557
13650. gracias i hollered my first long swallow filling me with confidence	and immediately doubling the size of my spanish vocabulary.	5.5245393718415015
13651. at once my ears were drowned by a flow of what i took to be spanish	but- the driver's white teeth flashing at me the road wildly	veering beyond his glistening hair beyond his gesticulating bottle-	it could have	been the purest oxford english i was half hearing; i	wouldn't have known the difference.	3.2649600692808423
13652. johnson was trying to	grab the wheel though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from	it.	5.057556181613073
13653. white teeth suddenly vanishing the driver slammed the side of	his bottle against johnson's ear.	4.108817742568763
13654. we were off the road gleaming	barbed wire pulling taut.	7.53224361745492
13655. i ducked just as the first strand broke	somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards.	4.654248473653896
13656. we	were in a field in a tight screeching turn.	6.570262098772678
13657. prairie dogs were popping	up and popping down.	4.913686410369733
13658. when i fell on my back i saw a vulture hovering.	7.040408437184573
13659. just as i got to my knees there was again the sound	of the fence stretching and i had time only to start taking my kneeling	posture seriously.	3.7206776678257896
13660. this time no wire came whipping into the truck.	7.19001638003447
13661. we were back on the road.	7.400327899913069
13662. i regained my squatting position	behind the truck cab's rear window.	6.38667026629645
13663. johnson's left hand was pressed	against the side of his head red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers.	4.241415089455873
13664. tee-wah the driver cackled his black eyes glittering	behind dull silver chicken fencing.	5.583228874976599
13665. that was tee-wah i was	talking.	7.577596975493748
13666. you thought i was a mexican didn't you buddy?	8.092001424825053
13667. 	i nodded.	8.12896173865557
13668. hell that's all right buddy the indian	said.	6.743273855772659
13669. miraculously	the bottle was still in my hand foam still geysering over my	waterproof watch.	4.237641749237555
13670. no sooner had i started drinking than the driver	started zigzagging the truck.	6.204123470233459
13671. i drank	furiously.	9.686204316035266
13672. emptied the bottle.	9.52328749892442
13673. teeth again flashing	back at me the driver released a deluge of spanish in which amigo	appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of	surrounding sound.	3.430996396590519
13674. i bobbed my head each time it appeared.	6.9995046480612055
13675. suddenly	the spanish became an english in which only one word emerged	with clarity and precision son of a bitch sometimes hyphenated	by vicious jabs of a beer bottle into johnson's quivering ribs.	3.3892734720983158
13676. a big car was approaching its chrome teeth grinning.	6.640620020398535
13677. beyond	it the gray road stretched a long long way.	4.541435882968914
13678. the car was just about to	us its driver's fat solemn face intent on the road ahead on business	on a family in sante fe- on anything but an old pick-up truck	in which two human beings desperately needed rescue.	4.519496503464104
13679. high so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off	the car's steel roof.	4.711152794223273
13680. on unoccupied roadway the bottle	shattered into a small amber flash.	6.757382565985779
13681. aye-yah-ah-ah!	the indian was again raising his bottle but to my astonished relief-	probably only a fraction of johnson's- the bottle this time	went to the indian's lips.	3.4199313728450442
13682. another car was coming a tiny	dark shape on a far hill.	6.150391742529064
13683. i started looking on the splintery truck	bed for a piece of board a dirt clod- anything i could throw and	with better aim than i had thrown the beer bottle.	3.7688573590748478
13684. in the ditch sand was white and soft-looking only an occasional	pebble discernible faintly gleaming.	5.684110462470789
13685. but johnson couldn't quickly	unwire the truck door and if i escaped he might suffer.	4.2259340303724455
13686. the car was approaching fast.	7.159105212715324
13687. on the truck bed there was nothing smaller	than a piece of rusty machinery; with more time i could have	loosened a small burr or cotter pin-   suddenly and not a second	too soon i thought of the coins in my pocket.	3.6647814944500476
13688. there was no time to	pick out a penny; i got a coin between my thumb and forefinger leaned	my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck	cab and flipped my little missile.	5.342092763312078
13689. there was a blur just under	my focus of vision a crash; the car's far windshield panel turned	into a silver web with a dark hole in the center.	3.909045944537122
13690. i heard	the screech of brakes behind me an insane burst of laughter beneath me.	5.65219859595529
13691. looking back i saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car	and trying to read our license number.	4.023616296471955
13692. johnson's	fat hand another bottle were protruding from the truck cab	and that self-proclaimed baptist teetotaler had a bottle at his own	lips.	4.861416487662795
13693. two cars came over a crest their chrome and glass flashing.	4.6205173836772815
13694. the indian's arm whipped sidewise- there was a flash of amber	and froth the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of	the first car.	4.86442796062285
13695. i saw johnson's	bottle snatched from his hand saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind	the second car.	3.945459818916682
13696. this time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking	of women.	7.232353977891073
13697. i looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated	oval of the car's rear window.	4.234164633210316
13698. drink you son of a bitch!	i quickly turned around and began to drink.	6.219187519205769
13699. but the indian was	jabbing another bottle toward johnson.	5.365802170016913
13700. i guided her to the divan turned off the tv faced her.	6.407083857719727
13701. she sat quietly staring at me from the wide eyes.	4.687080376675738
13702. and what eyes they	were.	11.26180196434645
13703. big and dark a melting golden brown.	4.913686410369733
13704. eyes like hot honey	eyes that sizzled.	7.163184125958424
13705. plus flawless skin smooth brow and cheeks lips that	looked as if you could get a shock from them.	3.719102832521527
13706. it was a disturbingly	familiar face too but i couldn't remember where we had met.	6.175543452004029
13707. i said do we know each other miss?	5.095208398041368
13708.    no i	remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here and	when it happened all i could think of was- this time she stopped	the rush of words herself.	4.894260506013608
13709. shall i go on?	6.278213011699894
13710. 	she smiled.	11.155741451300253
13711. it was her first smile.	6.620871667941329
13712. but one word at a time ok?	10.119392029978805
13713.  she	was	still hugging the stained coat around her so i said relax let	me take your things.	3.8101576301595865
13714. would you like a drink or coffee?	8.710972364989173
13715. 	no thanks.	8.12896173865557
13716. she stood up pulled the coat from her shoulders and	started to slide it off then let out a high-pitched scream and i	let out a low-pitched wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out.	4.644003419401091
13717. she	was wearing nothing beneath the coat.	5.253462372744382
13718. she jerked the coat back on and	squeezed it around her again but not soon enough.	5.555479069676086
13719. there had been a	good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out and	now i was certain i'd seen her somewhere before.	3.976128898840205
13720. oh do forgive me.	9.921711973122616
13721. i'm sorry!	i forgive-   that's what started all the trouble in	the first place.	4.0683852436856025
13722. oh dear i'm all unstrung.	8.887941185542141
13723. you and	me both dear.	8.09303208031044
13724. haven't we h haven't i seen you h.	6.412214371980113
13725. i mean	surely we've-   you may have seen me on tv	she said.	4.921419900084598
13726. i've done several filmed commercials for-	then it hit me.	6.144814417540349
13727. and	you recognized me?	6.939425769494729
13728.    yes indeed.	14.714264832566434
13729. in fact i was watching	you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell.	4.292615660614394
13730. man you rang- it was in color too miss and h miss?	6.919378529400983
13731.  what's	your name anyway?	6.939425769494729
13732.  ah you were splendid.	8.457718703298294
13733. i sat by her on	the divan.	5.79847623263147
13734. in a waterfall h and all that.	8.051780351520344
13735. that's	the last one we did.	5.619635421798327
13736. that was a fun one.	11.588881883123214
13737. it was fun for me all right.	5.819447695563911
13738. i don't mean to pry but do	they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles?	5.849470735102582
13739.  i mean: is advertising	honest?	7.028761150033486
13740.    it depends on who does it.	8.552984457661603
13741. i never wear anything	at all.	7.1119407664266205
13742. it wouldn't- wouldn't seem fair somehow.	8.39397876591202
13743. i couldn't agree with you more.	5.79847623263147
13744. i really do have something	important to tell you mr scott.	7.179595511531133
13745. murder?	10.144513917544229
13746.  oh yeah i said.	9.921711973122616
13747. tell me about the murder.	5.718730376035163
13748. zing was the creation of two men louis	thor and bill blake partners in zing! inc.	5.6841263656509495
13749. they'd	peddled the soap virtually alone and without much success until	about a year ago when- with the addition of sx-21 to their	secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising	campaign- sales had soared practically into orbit.	3.4704256701214313
13750. their product had	been endorsed by good housekeeping the ama and the	veterinary journal among other repositories of higher wisdom	and before much longer if you didn't have a cake of their soap in	the john even your best friends would think you didn't bathe.	4.428438783584598
13751. my lovely caller- joyce holland was her name- had previously	done three filmed commercials for zing and this evening the fourth	a super production had been filmed at the home of louis thor.	3.5802941040977623
13752. the water in thor's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket	of thick foamy soapsuds- fashioned of course from zing-	joyce had dived from the board into the pool then swirled and cavorted	in her luxurious bath while cameras rolled.	4.318390326173695
13753. the finished-	and drastically cut- product would begin with a hazy longshot of	joyce entering the suds then bursting above the pool's surface clad	in layers of lavender lather and i had a hunch this item was going	to sell tons and tons of soap; even to clean men and boys.	3.101807495662794
13754. joyce went on when we'd finished lou- mr thor- asked	me to stay a little longer.	5.2288514545018705
13755. he wanted a few stills for magazine ads	he said.	5.012946725286788
13756. everybody left and i stayed in the pool then lou came	back alone and leaped into the pool too.	5.558652207024168
13757. and he didn't have any clothes	on.	6.6821221269722
13758. he didn't!   yes he didn't.	8.132854117812016
13759. did leap into the pool and didn't	have anything on.	4.926829505054184
13760. anyway it was evident what he had in mind.	6.721088668784407
13761. you got away didn't you?	7.159500218971222
13762.    yes.	13.921774766768346
13763. he	caught up with me once and grabbed me but i was all covered with zing-	it's very slippery you know.	3.9900503994619974
13764. i wouldn't have the stuff in the house.	6.9995046480612055
13765. but i'm pleased to	hear-   so i just scooted out of his clutches.	4.6892553825870875
13766. i swam	like mad got out of the pool grabbed my robe and ran to the car.	6.599048223736584
13767. the	keys were still in it and i was miles away before i remembered	that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana	where i'd changed.	3.6947443774475106
13768. she'd driven around for a while	joyce said then thinking louis thor would have calmed down by that	time she'd gone back to his home on bryn mawr drive parked	in front and walked toward the pool.	4.509260977337015
13769. while several yards from it still	concealed by the shrubbery she'd seen two men on her left at the	pool's edge.	3.8084053158793494
13770. she went on:   a man was holding onto lou	holding him up.	6.409813646372151
13771. maybe lou was only unconscious but right then i	thought he must be dead.	4.465356264801247
13772. the man shoved him into the water then ran	past the cabana.	6.242906193699152
13773. there's a walk there that goes out to quebec drive.	4.501400099291314
13774. i was so scared h well i just ran to my car and came here.	5.8822887070497805
13775. you know who the other man was?	6.408415141072365
13776.    no i never	did see his face.	8.392534555193407
13777. i didn't get a good look at him at all his back	was to me and i was so scared h it was just somebody in a man's	suit.	3.793014269510256
13778. but i'm sure the other one was lou.	6.9332890522555335
13779. what joyce	wanted me to do was go to thor's house and do whatever detectives	do and get her clothes- and handbag containing her identification.	3.777166751935232
13780. she realized i'd have to notify the police but fervently	hoped i could avoid mentioning her name.	5.442661456391538
13781. her impact in the	zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent	part in an upcoming tv series underwater western eye a	documentary-type show to be sponsored by oatnut grits.	3.4570462876929646
13782. but if joyce	got involved in murder or salacious scandal the role would probably	go to the sponsor's wife mrs oatnut grits.	5.401420209107197
13783. or at least not	to joyce.	8.483185979949457
13784. and i so want the part she said.	7.673709651982714
13785. the	commercials have just been for money there hasn't been any real incentive	for me to do them but in underwater western eye i'd	have a chance to act.	3.648298844662998
13786. i could show what i can do.	8.086016491988975
13787. as far as i was concerned she had already and had dandily shown what	she could do.	4.8054713047627935
13788. but i promised joyce i would mention her name if	at all only as a last resort.	6.264417765890492
13789. seeming much relieved she smiled one	of those worth-waiting-for smiles and i smiled all the way into the	bedroom.	4.194178613512126
13790. there i got my colt special and shoulder harness slipped	my coat on and went back into the front room.	6.08583332573892
13791. joyce squirmed	a little on the divan.	5.864457275639419
13792. i'm starting to itch she said.	7.163184125958424
13793. itch?	10.144513917544229
13794.    yes i'm still all covered with that	soap.	8.217973091957495
13795. i was loaded with suds when i ran away and i haven't had a	chance to wash it off.	4.0223478710232765
13796. you might	as well wait here while i'm gone so you can use my shower if you'd	like.	6.548311387774245
13797. i showed her the shower	and tub and she said smiling if you really don't mind i think	i'll get clean in the shower then soak for a few minutes in your	tub.	3.7532603879341577
13798. doesn't it you?	9.52328749892442
13799.    only	when i do it.	6.162967476035402
13800. one of my virtues or vices is	a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and	glorious living color.	5.995420597715362
13801. soak h as long as you want joyce.	6.242820321968313
13802. it'll	probably be at least an hour or two before i can check back with	you.	5.778797827091766
13803. so you'll have everything all to yourself doggone h	i looked at my watch.	4.415776716989622
13804. time to go i supposed.	9.997180072541035
13805. you'd better hurry.	6.939425769494729
13806. oh you can count on that.	8.452407796069176
13807. warmly.	10.144513917544229
13808. i'll be soaking	for h at least half an hour.	6.144814417540349
13809. that was all she said.	7.575778118125237
13810. but suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms	of bees in them.	6.293908263199443
13811. however when there's a job to be done i'm	a monstrosity of grim determination i like to think.	4.651168250863972
13812. i spun about	and clattered through the front room to the door.	6.647677266310064
13813. as i went out i	could hear water pouring in the shower.	4.929816502097681
13814. she wouldn't be	taking a cold shower.	8.037204458577536
13815. bryn mawr drive	is only two or three miles from the spartan and it took me less than	five minutes to get there.	4.177684695927497
13816. but the scene was not the quiet calm scene	i'd expected.	7.482399028726425
13817. four cars were parked at the curb and two of them	were police radio cars.	4.341704525176526
13818. lights blazed in the big house and surrounding	grounds.	7.1913783858928095
13819. i followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the	house to the pool.	4.545101815077141
13820. two uniformed officers a couple of plain-clothesmen	i knew and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the	pool on my left.	5.421101804343509
13821. at the pool's far end was the little cabana joyce	had mentioned and on the water's surface floated scattered lavender	patches of limp-looking lather.	4.10267329976131
13822. a few yards beyond the group of men	a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra.	5.834101677655607
13823. lieutenant rawlins one of the plain-clothesmen spotted	me and said hi shell and walked toward me.	4.463205031967019
13824. how'd you	hear about this one?	7.712079578137997
13825.  i grinned but ignored the question.	5.79847623263147
13826. he didn't	push it; rawlins worked out of central homicide and we'd	been friends for years.	5.47495185046749
13827. a call to the police	had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine pm	and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that-	10 minutes ago now.	3.6833498537112597
13828. present at the scene- in addition to the dead	man who was indeed louis thor- had been thor's partner bill	blake and antony rose an advertising agency executive who handled	the zing account.	4.971037858688311
13829. neither of them i understood had been present	at the filming session earlier.	4.667168470653785
13830. what were they doing here?	9.152339195294
13831. 	i asked rawlins.	6.939425769494729
13832. they were supposed to meet thor	at nine pm for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their	soap a new angle based on this sx-21 stuff.	5.039036661596227
13833. yeah	i've heard more about sx-21 than space exploration lately.	4.477601198394805
13834. what is the gunk?	12.803583174137742
13835.    how would i know?	7.63543252423159
13836.  it's a secret.	10.658728722524671
13837. that was the new advertising angle- something about a lloyd's	of london policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient.	4.511531940985682
13838. actually	only two men know what the formula is blake and- he	stopped and looked at thor's body.	5.466906168848786
13839. i said ok	so now only blake knows.	5.400630548460668
13840. how's it strike you foul or fair?	6.743273855772659
13841. 	can't say yet.	6.939425769494729
13842. deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked	in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on 'em.	5.0303106190507
13843. the pm	might show he drowned instead but that's what the once-over-lightly	gives us.	3.8290139235489336
13844. accident murder suicide- take your pick.	7.163184125958424
13845. anything else?	8.12896173865557
13846.    according to rose	he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted thor in	the water got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started	hauling him out.	4.881116683891857
13847. too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education	is to help you make a living; this is not so for education offers	all kinds of dividends including how to pull the wool over a husband's	eyes while you are having an affair with his wife.	3.7380087911093884
13848. if it were	not for an old professor who made me read the classics i would have	been stymied on what to do and now i understand why they are classics;	those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick.	4.842589715833656
13849. i worked for my uncle	who ran one of those antique	shops in new orleans' vieux carre the old french quarter.	4.107844069898782
13850. the	arrangement i had with him was to work four hours a day.	6.201239677507058
13851. the rest	of the time i devoted to painting or to those other activities a young	and healthy man just out of college finds interesting.	3.3449683241072443
13852. i had	a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with	flowers and plants blooming everlastingly in the southern sun.	5.26031541208977
13853. i had	come to new orleans two years earlier after graduating college partly	because i loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted	art colony there.	3.6895999165347515
13854. when my uncle offered me a part-time job which	would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint i accepted.	5.220323510324598
13855. the arrangement turned out to be excellent.	5.460048208887186
13856. i loved the	city and i particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of mardi gras.	5.65219859595529
13857. i had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide	joyous celebration with romance in the air; and when you took a walk	you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting	around the next corner.	3.533074156719326
13858. the very faces of the people bore this expectation	of fun and pleasure.	6.537884231931035
13859. it was as if they could hardly wait to get	into their costumes cover their faces with masks and go adventuring.	4.3065961575985865
13860. my uncle and i were not too close socially because	of the difference in our ages.	5.792504703670291
13861. sometimes i wondered vaguely what he	did about women for my aunt by blood had died some years ago but neither	of us said anything.	3.87078221898644
13862. one monday morning i saw him approach the	store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new aunt.	5.755199623861864
13863. they were	married over the week-end though he was easily sixty and she could	not have been even thirty.	3.8327669075120774
13864. she looked more like twenty-five or six.	7.487284654669317
13865. it was really a may and december combination.	5.283501481322339
13866. my new aunt	was perhaps three or four years older than i and it had been a long	time since i had seen as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex.	5.8306571946214065
13867. there was	something about the contour of her face her smile that was like new	orleans sunshine the way she held her head the way she walked- there	was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me.	3.5157404720408385
13868. her legs	were the full sexy kind full bodied like a rare wine and just as	tantalizing to the appetite; the calf was magnificent the ankle perfect.	4.859875505665223
13869. you must forgive me if i seem to dwell too much on her	physical aspects but i am an artist accustomed to studying the physical	body.	4.214076569900478
13870. the true artist is like one of those scientists who from	a single bone can reconstruct an animal's entire body.	5.241643158862025
13871. the artist looks	at an ankle a calf a bosom and in his mind's eye the clothes	drop away and he sees her as she really is.	3.5006105748922773
13872. and that is the way i	first saw her when my uncle brought her into his antique store.	7.301404678270479
13873. that she impressed me instantly was obvious; i was aware that when	our eyes met we both quickly averted them.	3.9188554361527324
13874. i thought i saw a faint	surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks.	5.598505085771911
13875. true	she was my aunt married to an uncle related to me only by marriage	but why she had married a man twice her age and more perhaps i	did not know or much care.	3.245088357445185
13876. she was standing with her back to	the glass door.	7.353922084126965
13877. her form was silhouetted and with the strong light i	could see the outlines of her body a body that an artist or anyone	else would have admired.	3.754294196613034
13878. as it is in so many affairs of the heart a	man and a woman meet and something clicks.	8.043281656298857
13879. something clicked in this	instance but i treated her circumspectly and i felt that she knew	it for we both kept our distance.	3.721458389911098
13880. when she appeared at the store	to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious	lest my uncle notice it.	6.266453729355545
13881. and then i became aware that she too	glanced at me surreptitiously.	4.993530103108757
13882. i felt that her eyes were undressing me	as if she were a painter and i a nude model.	5.539491221573139
13883. i dismissed these feelings	as wishful thinking but i could not get it out of my head that	we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared	to dwell on it because of our relationship.	3.49981761552281
13884. when our eyes met the air	was filled with an unuttered message of me too.	6.135079750901037
13885. you have probably	experienced this.	8.93185970393673
13886. it is nothing you can put your fingers on but	the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity.	5.610620403450714
13887. why	she married him i do not know.	5.987858885728657
13888. i myself was fond of him but what a	young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me.	5.084875109216968
13889. he already	had that slow pace that comes over the elderly while she herself had	all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living.	3.516231736678361
13890. perhaps with	my uncle she found a measure of economic security that she needed;	or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father; some women with	father fixations do.	5.224773544555942
13891. for several weeks we eyed one another	almost like sparring partners and then one day uncle was slightly indisposed	and stayed home; his bride opened the store.	3.621192086411512
13892. i was waiting	in front of it when she showed up and told me of my uncle's indisposition.	6.087158018053883
13893. even as she was telling me about it i became aware of a give-away	flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks and	subconsciously i realized that when she entered the store she did	not switch on the lights.	3.503245063387092
13894. the cavernous depth cluttered with antiques	echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the	rear and took the seat at his desk.	4.543626011007759
13895. she placed her palms fingers	outspread on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say now what next?	3.975982995320355
13896. 	i was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me	the time was opportune.	5.281083805578865
13897. there was little likelihood of any customers	walking in at that hour.	5.053717518743647
13898. i was standing beside her watching the outspread	palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall	on which he sometimes napped.	5.187456540266783
13899. i bent and kissed the still pink	neck and suddenly she jumped up and her two arms encircled me in	a bear-like crush.	3.6539122345273842
13900. her mouth which had been so much in my thoughts	was warm and moist and tender.	6.586090539365479
13901. i heard her murmur we'd better	lock the door.	5.170499740504521
13902. it did not take me long to slip the bolt securely	and return to the rear and its couch.	6.500411007780448
13903. when we opened the	door again for business and switched on the lights she said:	he will not always be indisposed.	4.112689905345083
13904. i was thinking	about that.	11.192764682197463
13905. how will we work it out?	6.199055737287018
13906.    i don't	know she said.	9.645886477709713
13907. you figure it out.	8.09303208031044
13908. i've	noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met.	5.871149558571111
13909. i guess we both felt it.	5.79847623263147
13910. i guess so	she said.	9.645886477709713
13911. but now what?	9.401545779173658
13912.    even as i said it i	realized that an education can be invaluable.	6.230705287282297
13913. i know what	we can do i said.	6.094989730128358
13914. tell him i made a pass at you.	6.498841324801834
13915. she	raised a protesting hand with a startled air.	4.6724501027054846
13916. what are	you trying to do?	9.152339195294
13917.  get thrown out?	8.031487764869926
13918.  if i even hint at it do you think	it will matter that you are his nephew- and not even a blood nephew?	5.557954158073974
13919. 	i don't want to be thrown out and i don't think	i will.	4.684671821851822
13920. i think i have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting	us.	7.675347279462856
13921. by telling him you are making passes at me?	4.946783655199153
13922. 	she said incredulously.	9.52328749892442
13923. when i was in college i	grinned i remember a poem i had to read in my lit class.	4.553609309580038
13924. i don't	even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century	poets.	7.414821603147582
13925. in those days poems often told a story in verse and those	boys had some corkers to tell; and now i think we can use the knowledge	they passed on to us.	3.851295244313923
13926. tomorrow mardi gras opens officially.	7.712079578137997
13927. a lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks and having	a ball.	4.488283587877785
13928. there will be romance and flirtation.	10.48692939484115
13929. if you tell him i	made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something i said	or did so instead of just telling him i made a pass say i tried to	date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse	i really am.	3.2616509545060066
13930. we made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street	near lake ponchartrain.	5.858731650914015
13931. and to prove what you tell him about	me you suggest that he keep the date instead.	4.146609635497035
13932. you are both the same size.	9.614251285625913
13933. he could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask.	4.3404974544492125
13934. when i show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him	about it.	6.179522044447826
13935. don't	worry about me.	6.939425769494729
13936. it will turn out all right.	9.37189241649528
13937. i don't understand	she insisted.	7.028761150033486
13938. are you trying to cut your throat?	8.55547422340939
13939. 	no i chuckled i'm just beginning to collect dividends	on my investment in education.	4.091844795473403
13940. as we expected on	the following day my uncle was completely recovered and opened the store	as usual at 10 in the morning.	5.363006758005941
13941. i felt that he looked at me coldly	and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards	me should be but he did not say one word which might indicate that	he had been told of advances to his wife.	3.7699577036199274
13942. i quit work at my usual	hour as if this day was no different from other days.	5.536313160395924
13943. i heard subsequently	that my uncle and aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in	the french quarter after which he went home to get into his costume	to keep the date.	3.5730890585802766
13944. shortly before nine i drove my jalopy to the street	facing the lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from	the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view.	4.848538169246094
13945. a few minutes later i saw my uncle's car drive up and a woman's	figure emerge and walk to the corner.	4.216789972836759
13946. i must say the figure was	well made up.	7.612493288741662
13947. if it were not that i knew who it was i could have mistaken	it for my aunt so well did her clothes fit him.	4.0238950231662916
13948. in one hand he	gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain.	6.620644720128822
13949. i suspected why he brought it along.	5.406629921006237
13950. in the half darkness i	approached cautiously making sure he did not see me.	6.627669165251262
13951. he was looking	out on the dark waters of the lake when i came upon him and without	wasting words i smacked him hard across the face.	3.843398446998571
13952. you cheap	bitch! i exclaimed.	11.1064335578917
13953. you cheap no good two-timing bitch!	you get a good loyal husband- smack!- and you fall for a pass	by his own nephew! you should- smack!- be ashamed of yourself.	3.538494413202699
13954. he had better write a postcard to walter.	7.888665485839824
13955. he opened the myth book again	and there	were the names of four munich bars and meredith wilder's address.	3.936544900400054
13956. the bars were marked as walter had marked them in a small black	book kept in a nearly secret drawer.	5.06166578103243
13957. the code which had probably	something to do with sex or some other interest nicolas was determined	to find out and put to use.	3.6763091671108876
13958. a card to walter would get him an introduction	to this meredith and that might be good for something.	5.272119326852856
13959. nicolas	called on his muse a line came back:   squaresville	man and all the palazzos are crummy palasts.	4.091058763878212
13960. that	ought	to draw a laugh nicolas reasoned as he stored the line away on the	wax tape that was his mind.	5.01224131420537
13961. and indeed his postcard did draw	from walter a letter recommending his friend the poet nicolas manas	to his friend meredith wilder.	3.6647646526180786
13962. five days later on receiving it	meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table.	5.777230006464411
13963. his hand was large and square and heavily tanned.	4.6567305559976715
13964. the voice crying in him was the voice of guilt.	6.147506860574055
13965. his four weeks	in italy had turned into nearer three months.	4.478356756682905
13966. he had returned to the	pension a week ago.	7.790175740688019
13967. now he was just in the late poems of ho^lderlin	and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him- plus	next semester's class preparation.	4.641320231080459
13968. he was determined to spend an	industrious summer.	7.8992741135655615
13969. well maybe manas wouldn't call.	6.877390903555252
13970. meredith's	fingers slowed and stopped over a line before him: sie la^cheln	die schwarzen hexen.	5.542940710878111
13971. the menace of manas gradually faded	as meredith asked himself should he translate it 'how the dark	fates laughed'?	3.428445430010395
13972.  or more rhythmically 'the swarthy witches are	laughing'?	7.776924005364837
13973.  and he missed the point that the swarthy witches might	be laughing at him for hoping to escape nicolas manas.	4.135794783447378
13974. but	nicolas too was being interrupted that morning.	6.743273855772659
13975. not by the	11:00 sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the	english gardens and sent him off to sleep; but by a blond girl in	a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded	him.	3.4314648935876786
13976. should she wake him?	10.296293995740221
13977.  she didn't have the heart.	6.602001037988012
13978. her heart	her maternal feeling in fact her h her being was too busy expressing	itself as quietly thrilled by this sight of her nicolas curled asleep	under a blanket in a park like a scene from poussin.	4.527186070238922
13979. she was just	not able to break the spell.	5.613362867612101
13980. known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer nicolas had	found his first night in one of walter's marked bars?	5.34628562555015
13981.  nicolas:	look nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys- no sex see?	4.276062611997943
13982.  so	if all these beers was to get me in bed man you just spent a lot	of money.	5.195811848831416
13983. ballet dancer: protests tears and take what you	want nicolas i am a dancer you are a poet it is all beautiful.	4.151873817053052
13984. to this meek conjugation nicolas had replied ok i can	use this blanket.	6.349900365411994
13985. and when you get off this job tonight well you	can gimme something to eat.	4.365900757664067
13986. and as a matter of fact nicolas had	slept in the park only part of one night when he discovered that munich's	early mornings even in summer are laden with dew.	5.8423899283583625
13987. he had always	known how to find a bed and on his own terms.	5.401864376075143
13988. he used the blanket	for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs	and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few	her nicolas lay	curled in the sun like a fawn black hair falling over his eyes.	4.4363844119460945
13989. she	was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of	a long meaningful search for truth.	4.067245779694473
13990. this was surely a reunion in art	it was all that poetry promised.	6.3469774797236145
13991. that long night with nicolas	and marijuana in venice had opened her eyes.	4.491700615163783
13992. his advice his voice	saying his poems the fact that he had not so much as touched her-	on the contrary he had put his head back and she had stroked his	hair- this was all new.	5.888654959949908
13993. her eyes had opened she had caught a glimpse	of a new faith.	4.433524796184818
13994. the next day he was gone.	8.554117728245958
13995. mary jane	might not be the most intelligent woman but she was one of the most	determined.	5.329179557416946
13996. even so it took her several days to force walter to tell	her nicolas's whereabouts.	6.5044545748328915
13997. packing a small suitcase informing	her husband whom she found in harry's bar that she was taking a train	to germany to get away for a while patting his arm refusing a	drink getting on the train- all this had only taken her two hours.	3.4211825654671553
13998. she had arrived this morning and come straight to the english gardens.	6.707781538542854
13999. dear girl walter had finally said he writes me that he	is sleeping in the english gardens.	3.767613917144257
14000. how like him! mary	jane had smilingly said.	7.884319965066006
14001. his address walter added is that	great foundling home the american express.	4.328270480806391
14002. and i will greatly	appreciate it if you will not tell your husband h.	6.949241307935377
14003. for the last	half hour mary jane had criss-crossed half the length of the gardens	and at last come upon her knight.	4.374777049967723
14004. his presence there asleep in	the grass confirmed all that mary jane believed it was in his power	to teach her: freedom from the tedium of needs such as hotels the meaning	of nature how to live simply with the angels.	4.743071069888181
14005. she set	down her suitcase.	7.116861319551038
14006. should she wake him?	10.296293995740221
14007.  no.	10.144513917544229
14008. smiling she sat down	on the suitcase and waited and watched.	5.9245075971793435
14009. the sun grew hotter	as it approached the midday.	4.478541156805921
14010. nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed	against the dashboard of a speeding car.	5.613385913189416
14011. in	his dream he cried slow down for chrissake! he half woke	and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass.	3.8115720922533622
14012. he blew his nose expertly between his fingers.	6.672854314451728
14013. he half sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then	more vigorously between his legs.	3.7125232616762074
14014. mary jane got up quietly and walked away.	6.9287481440619505
14015. twenty minutes	later she was at the desk of the gra^fin's pension her tears	dried signing a hotel form and asking for a bath.	4.15237370033201
14016. mary jane	belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions	in all the major and minor cities.	5.481160440284846
14017. she had retreated to this world.	6.614171671032987
14018. the gra^fin who was charmed by her told her your sister who	was here two years ago has quite dark hair.	5.000865803101205
14019. nevertheless there is no bath.	8.89393419275673
14020. but a young american	has a bath next to his room and i shall ask him if you might use it	this once.	5.486147157516613
14021. and then we shall see h.	7.633386135936698
14022. meredith was irritated when the gra^fin	knocked at his door and told him she is a great beauty!	shall we allow her not to have a bath?	5.679841015931918
14023.  actually she is a sad beauty	i believe.	6.72250474756863
14024. you shall see her at dinner.	8.907651622822808
14025. rather erotically	he listened to the bath water running; when it stopped he began busily	typing sitting up in a virtuous way.	4.110648787467657
14026. before dinner he shaved for	the second time that day.	7.084036424162717
14027. a thing he did not like doing generally.	5.539434147266546
14028. singing into the mirror and his interested eyes he was pleased to note	when he stripped for his own bath that he still had the best part	of his italian sun tan.	4.617222347140329
14029. he flexed his muscles for several minutes	got into the tub and then grew self-conscious of splashing as he washed.	3.6606271074526586
14030. in the small gallery used as the guests' dining room meredith	sat down at his place and as always began teasing the young	waitress.	5.273239763278013
14031. he was asking had it been she who left the love note in his	sheets when he saw the gra^fin followed	by a stately blond girl approaching his table.	3.8370874622739617
14032. it would be literary	license calculated to glamorize life to say that he oh dropped his napkin	so startled was he by mary jane's beauty.	5.931956582241352
14033. yet he did drop	his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the	gra^fin as acknowledgement that here indeed was something special.	3.7524785035389288
14034. mary jane had made very little effort.	7.337976799234834
14035. above a dark green skirt	she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with as he soon perceived no	brassiere	beneath.	3.955464571540753
14036. her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight	down to her shoulders.	5.907543411643021
14037. perhaps her eyes were larger and more of	a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day.	4.109155858904363
14038. she had touched	her face truly a noble and pure face only with a lip salve which	made her lips glisten but no redder than usual.	5.085233635681623
14039. the result was grace	and modesty.	6.125810011386234
14040. as she was rather tired this evening her simple thank	you for the use of your bath- when she sat down opposite him-	spoken in a low voice came across with coolnesses of intelligence	and control.	5.233377148886794
14041. meredith began falling in love.	5.619635421798327
14042. soup: only	this	morning; veal cutlets: oh i couldn't possibly eat all	this!; wine: then you were typing poems this afternoon?	4.985333447698777
14043. ;	fruit compote: if you think i would understand it;	a smile.	4.68130130966351
14044. like h as if it were	built of books.	8.554145552126933
14045. having opened the windows onto the terrace	lit the fire translated the motto meredith grinned and took down	a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin.	3.5007665172643048
14046. opening these	he brought out a schnapps bottle and small gold thimble-sized glasses	hidden inside it.	5.331440467598945
14047. i think the maids tipple in the afternoon.	6.363871273278613
14048. those sweet girls?	12.289893311335454
14049.  oh h you're joking.	7.22974957456316
14050. it tastes	a little like poppyseed.	9.197812658856618
14051. what's its name?	6.939425769494729
14052.  steinha^ger h	she whispered steinha^ger to herself several times memorizing	it.	6.144814417540349
14053. would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me	read it to myself?	4.307740700906585
14054.  meredith's voice was always deep with rough	bass notes in it; in reading on platforms even in the large auditorium	of the ymha poetry center nights his voice	was intimate thoughtful and a trifle shy.	4.864690613959065
14055. his new poem a love poem	told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when	the lights in the house have failed.	3.9790833606201033
14056. the husband points the steps	out with his flashlight: its white stare filling her pale eyes	to the blind brim with appetite bleaching her hands that grazed my	thighs and sent us from the table in surprise to let the dishes soak	all night	but he read on.	4.373432046489248
14057. in the bedroom	before the husband and wife find their way to the bed the lights go	on: in dull domestic radiance i watch her staring face still	blind start wincing in obedience to dirty waters counters pots	and pans waiting below stairs in her mind.	3.4380008233733204
14058. mary jane took the	page from him and began reading it moving her lips with the words.	5.5297856773478875
14059. oh it's that myth about orpheus and h what is her name?	4.406449118895257
14060. 	i can never pronounce it.	7.712079578137997
14061. the	third time rather urgently.	6.244670994286538
14062. but with her hand poem again.	9.021885640513453
14063. she raised	her face and nodded it's sweet and very sad.	4.687080376675738

14066. she confessed she	was unhappy he asked was it her husband?	6.432292157928805
14067.  she began to explain there	was this poet in italy h he interrupted please don't	judge all poets.	3.965956626783016

14069. kissing	her he whispered several times eurydice.	5.219666477665999
14070. the third time	rather urgently.	8.387183786398253
14071. but with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment	she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his	bed excited expectant and finally faintly grinning with the feel of	her hand against his mouth.	3.30725854211271
14072. they were west of the sabine but only god knew where.	7.2934912235803
14073. for three days their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley	as flat and featureless as a dead sea.	4.0808250754849436
14074. molten glare singed their	eyelids an angry crimson; suffocating air sapped their strength and	strained their nerves to snapping; dust choked their throats and lay	like acid in their lungs.	4.566786271575569
14075. and the valley stretched endlessly out ahead	scorched and baked and writhing in its heat until it vanished into	the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze.	3.636288694940087
14076. ben prime extended	his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the	noses of the oxen.	5.138210239895059
14077. hoa-whup! he commanded from his raw throat	and felt the pain of movement in his cracked black burned lips.	3.632711015013689
14078. he removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through	the dust film upon his gaunt face.	5.524177667498228
14079. the dust-thick saliva came	from his mouth like balled cotton.	3.9843222565600884
14080. he moved back to the wheel and	stood there blowing grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling	of his played-out limbs.	6.010433829293767
14081. the burning air dried his sweat-soaked clothes	in salt-edged patches.	3.9843222565600884
14082. he cleared his throat and wet his	lips.	7.042834174643505
14083. as cheerfully as possible he said well i guess we could	all do with a little drink.	4.33592473876126
14084. he unlashed the dipper and drew	water from a barrel.	6.375016808455901
14085. they could no longer afford the luxury of the	canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation.	4.615543118903626
14086. the water was warm and	stale and had a brackish taste.	5.521444402819257
14087. thank the lord	they still had water!   he cleansed his mouth with a small quantity.	4.224340065445736
14088. he took a long but carefully controlled draught.	7.4843956376322565
14089. he replenished	the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck.	4.171118554252173
14090. she took it grudgingly her dark eyes baleful as they met his.	6.295589537201448
14091. she drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and	wipe her face.	4.048164525365109
14092. she set the dipper on the edge of the deck leaving	it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully.	5.764376982104347
14093. what happens when there's no more water?	5.646787194568706
14094.  she asked smolderingly.	12.24987093495357
14095. she was like charcoal he thought- dark opaque explosive.	5.303638536763268
14096. her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal.	6.757427109520501
14097. her temper	sparked like charcoal when it first lights up.	4.977215225893091
14098. and all the time she	had the heat of hatred in her like charcoal that is burning on its	under side but not visibly.	5.617170842944796
14099. a ripple ran through the muscles	of his jaws but he kept control upon his voice.	3.8947453628583015
14100. there must	be some water under there.	9.148467053817539
14101. he tilted his homely face toward the	dry bed of the river.	4.318068015596563
14102. we can get it if we dig he said patiently.	7.3277503179711605
14103. and add fever to our troubles?	5.662426777904248
14104.  she scoffed.	13.515432363756661
14105. or	do you want to see if i can stand fever too?	5.212776544167196
14106.    we can	boil it he said.	8.845542587831394
14107. we're lost and	burning up already she bit out tensely.	4.477601198394805
14108. the tires are rattling	on the wheels now.	5.8743971957932475
14109. they'll roll off in another day.	5.219666477665999
14110. there was no	valley like this on your map.	8.059518157776631
14111. you don't even know where we're headed.	5.990448704034849
14112. hettie he said as gently as he could we're	still headed west.	5.9529571448812515
14113. somewhere we'll hit a trail.	6.057146920651805
14114. maybe in time to make a cross and	dig our graves.	8.795751139742267
14115. in a way he couldn't	blame her.	7.508462700242663
14116. he had picked out this pathless trail instead of	the common one in a moment of romantic fancy to give them privacy on	their honeymoon.	5.4099577915799575
14117. it had been a mistake but anything would have	been a mistake as it turned out.	5.295752936878279
14118. it wasn't the roughness and crudity	and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her.	5.822387324843191
14119. she had hated	the whole idea before they started.	5.691655381666232
14120. actually she had hated him before	she ever saw him.	6.945903165158905
14121. it had been five days too late before he learned	that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of	laudanum administered by her mother.	3.9405212264101714
14122. the bitterness of their	wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound.	4.983240996215937
14123. she had jumped	away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder.	4.431089132258152
14124. he	had left her inviolate thinking familiarity would gentle her in time.	5.787082218503058
14125. but each mile westward she had hated him the deeper.	4.67151560347779
14126. he stared	at the dipper turning it over and over in his wide calloused hands.	5.8758881442832624
14127. i suppose he muttered i can sell the outfit for enough	to send you home to your folks once we find a settlement.	3.7910684720742176
14128. don't try to be noble! her laugh was hard.	6.443154455451338
14129. they	wouldn't	have sold me in the first place if there'd been food enough to	go around.	4.669161453966544
14130. hettie they didn't sell you	he said miserably.	6.743273855772659
14131. they knew i was a good sharecrop farmer back	in carolina but out west was a chance to build a real farm of our	own.	4.653361906846087
14132. they thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where	nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's	inside of them.	6.41368096766112
14133. without money or property what would you have	had at baton rouge?	4.602555874188939
14134.    i might have starved but at least	i wouldn't be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt!	he darkened under his heavy burn.	5.061498817541439
14135. his blue eyes sought the shimmering	sea of haze ahead.	4.658011605191661
14136. to his puzzlement there suddenly was	no	haze.	8.379757197353397
14137. the valley lay clear and open to the eye right up to the sharp-limbed	line of gaunt scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty	miles ahead.	3.693484497959242
14138. then he noticed the clouds racing upon them- heavy	ominous leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests	of the surrounding hills.	5.1582225146743745
14139. he had never seen clouds like them before	but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before	a hurricane in carolina.	4.234914375200612
14140. he hollered hoarsely hang on!	and goaded the oxen as he yelled.	5.925879823256658
14141. he wanted to turn them putting	the wagon against the storm.	5.429589202596905
14142. too late he realized that in turning	he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground instead of atop a	grade or ridge.	5.129862127532304
14143. he swung up over the wheel.	5.475289483739853
14144. you had better	get inside he warned her.	8.216735614915084
14145. but she sat on in stubborn silence.	5.815127206956898
14146. the clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great	black funnel.	5.1876391344755595
14147. frozen they stared at it whirling down the valley	gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving	hound dog cracking marrowbones.	3.4350960928305088
14148. the six-ton conestoga began to whip	and shake.	5.8743971957932475
14149. it was filled with dust	and wind and sound and violence.	5.266258117491228
14150. the heavens opened pelting them with	hail the size of walnuts.	6.453921059784536
14151. and then came the water- not rain but	solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket.	4.071398145737501
14152. walls	of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests	of flash floods.	5.2288514545018705
14153. through the splash of the rising waters they could	hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon gnashing	big chunks out of the banks.	4.201252167377739
14154. the jetting frothing surface of	the river reached the level of the runoff.	5.978917172694259
14155. the dangerous current upon	the prairie ceased but the water stood and kept on rising.	3.570845587849075
14156. they cringed	under sodden covers listening to the waves slop against the bottom.	5.87819432017988
14157. the cloudburst cut off abruptly.	4.747750369463677
14158. they were engulfed by	the weird silence broken only by the low angry murmur of the river.	6.123676948715694
14159. then the darkness thinned and there was light again and then bright	sunlight.	5.15925352972188
14160. beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill they	crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water	that reached clear to the surrounding hills.	4.831232755599742
14161. the water level was	higher than their hubs.	4.492235809562967
14162. only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored.	7.160225249284991
14163. there was no real sign of the river now just a roiling	oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere.	4.156875839976282
14164. clumps of brush rode down the ribbon.	6.743273855772659
14165. now and then the glistening	side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past.	4.910882786804589
14166. the girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine hugging	her shoulders and still trembling.	5.2009267277876825
14167. her face was pale but set and	her dark eyes smoldered with blame for ben.	4.1933471961413415
14168. out of compulsion	to say something cheery ben prime blurted well we were lucky	to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit.	5.399075737371969
14169. at least the wheels	dug in.	8.87244872766724
14170. the soaking will put life back in the wagon too.	5.914384173105443
14171. his wife didn't give a sign she'd heard.	4.864422920992949
14172. she was watching a	tree ride wildly down that roiling current.	6.933428972689788
14173. somebody was riding the	tree.	6.292021652893299
14174. it raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair sitting	astride an upright branch.	5.972606742864961
14175. she did not call out.	6.773018716886577
14176. but as	the tree passed she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell.	5.493341295483706
14177. they watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend.	4.418711685078926
14178. it speared	up into the air then sinking back the up-jutting branch turned	slowly.	6.602394339703774
14179. the pale blob of the woman disappeared.	4.280553672808819
14180. there's	the one who's lucky! the girl murmured harshly.	6.412214371980113
14181. ben's	eyes strained with the bitter hurt his homely face slashed with gray	and crimson.	3.9701983041559052
14182. then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into	the water to talk with the beasts needing their comfort more than they	needed his.	5.372571700172349
14183. it was nearly sundown and he went to the back of	the wagon half-swimming his way for he was not a tall man.	4.992192640069802
14184. he let	down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water.	5.792960178173353
14185. he sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of	seed grain forward.	4.228056053297331
14186. they were already swollen to bursting.	8.66179446319007
14187. of all	their worldly	belongings next to the oxen and his gun the seed grain had been	the most treasured.	4.42453638771988
14188. it was spoiled now for seed and it would sour	and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry	it.	5.359988387592349
14189. the oxen might as well enjoy it.	4.280553672808819
14190. he examined the water marks	on the iron tires when the animals were finished.	5.603893504423084
14191. the waters lay	muddy but placid without a ripple of movement against the wheels; there	was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding.	3.26523937294134
14192. he doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate dry hills	that rimmed the valley.	6.461844012451522
14193. a terrible numbing sense of futility swept	over him.	4.6187174129353075
14194. he gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of	defeat.	6.53652597010827
14195. then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen.	5.009617697406578
14196. the spokes were tight again the iron tires gripped onto the wheels	as if of one piece.	4.762804453309085
14197. he swung toward	the front	to give the news to hettie then stopped barred from her by	the vehemence of her blame and hate.	3.6007602500560596
14198. a tight	wagon meant so much.	7.5945983638677745
14199. he got a small fire started and put on bacon	and coffee.	4.883213893122808
14200. he poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour	salvaging the chunky watery messes for biscuits of a sort.	5.074303797295556
14201. their	jams and jellies had not suffered.	5.219666477665999
14202. he found a jar of preserved tomatoes	and one of eggs that they had meant to save.	5.875553691188968
14203. now he broke them open	hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing hettie.	4.373166977526938
14204. his long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating	java but the fire was low and he wanted to waste no time.	5.08685892052473
14205. he	furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins leaving the ribs and	wagon open.	4.523268173815389
14206. he looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk holding	her meager treasures.	6.129824662257567
14207. he said hesitantly hettie i don't	figure your things got wet too much.	4.750933630057285
14208. if you	want to get them aired h   she said without turning her head	after that rain beating in atop the dust there isn't a thing	that won't be streaked.	4.913369287487325
14209. he drew a long breath and opened	the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs.	3.6606271074526586
14210. sulphur oil and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams	of.	6.457674964962378
14211. i suppose a lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold	and touched off the blaze.	4.21611828445678
14212. now roaring up in great oily clouds of	smoke and flames the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where	we huddled like suffocating sheep not knowing what to do h.	5.117313768529548
14213. the lifeboats were stuck fast.	4.747750369463677
14214. i heard a	cry from a stoker as a pillar of flame leaped from a hatch and tongued	the man's bare back.	5.113953253094573
14215. he sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard	into the shark-infested waters.	4.370095364877703
14216. one especially bad detonation	shook lifeboat no 3 which trembled violently in the davits.	6.111166948822961
14217. brassnose	yelled: come on sommers max h step on it we got	a chance now.	3.9701983041559052
14218. heave on those ropes; the boat's come unstuck.	6.412214371980113
14219. we pulled and swore and yanked and wept scraping our hands until	they bled profusely.	4.160616537259164
14220. the bonaventure was quivering and lurching	like an old spavined mare.	5.315964723648707
14221. her stern was down and a sharp list helped	us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water.	3.7513206078138444
14222. brassnose max and i leaped into the sea and swam to the	boat.	5.583228874976599
14223. let's get away fast said brassnose shaking water from	his mop of bleached hair.	3.9701983041559052
14224. that tub is going to explode all at once.	8.406816453874816
14225. then the bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a	roar of live steam geysers of sparks and flames and a dense cloud of	black-and-orange smoke.	3.801825783179853
14226. dimly we heard the voices of men in mortal	agony but we couldn't go back into that inferno.	5.545909677895611
14227. already our	leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water.	5.13774524901721
14228. sommers you	bale while we row brassnose commanded.	6.743273855772659
14229. as best as i could	determine we were some 700 miles west of new guinea in the bismark	archipelago.	4.0246222284525
14230. three days previously we had steamed past barren	rennell island in the distance.	6.355601286427491
14231. now we peered anxiously for any speck	of land in the pacific for this interminable bailing would have	to stop soon.	4.345241493958949
14232. there were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands;	our muscles were hot wires of pain.	5.813261497814191
14233. the big man with the whitened hair murmured something: his	words sounded as if they were in the manu tongue which i recognized	having studied the dialect in my anthropology 6 class at the	university of chicago.	3.886188624854046
14234. he then said something which struck	a chord in my memory.	6.719199468492208
14235. god help us if we're near the island	of eromonga.	4.9761098836189115
14236. we'd be in real trouble then.	7.290744328720749
14237. i'd rather keep bailing-	or sink.	5.619635421798327
14238. i was puzzled by the remark then i recalled	the voice of mild professor howard griggs three years ago in a	university lecture on primitive societies.	5.599327613678212
14239. he had been speaking of this	archipelago:   even when the islands were under german	mandate before world war 1 europeans gave eromonga a wide berth.	4.310659997676078
14240. the place is inhabited by several hundred warlike women who are	anachronisms of the twentieth century- stone age amazons who live	in an all-female matriarchal society which is self-sufficient.	4.78791297403545
14241. i remembered too the jesting voice of a classmate bobby pauson:	but how do they reproduce dr griggs?	3.8745878378920167
14242.  i'm sure that	males have something to do with that process!   there had	been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as professor griggs said	dryly: i see your point pauson.	5.014990280425666
14243. of course males play a role	there but believe me when i say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one	bit on eromonga.	4.033542484816875
14244. indeed you wouldn't live long for the females	either drive the men they've seized from neighboring islands back	to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes or they destroy	them by revolting but ingenious methods.	4.60235572961118
14245. in fact one important	aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men.	4.536103093206144
14246. i	think i know what you mean brassnose i said.	6.4135581908709325
14247. i know something	about eromonga.	8.28786170474199
14248. let's hope we come to a safer place.	7.03537462444361
14249. three hours later while we were bailing desperately	a dot of land came into view.	4.338300306915155
14250. foster lukuklu frayne made a	sign over his heart with his two linked thumbs: i recognized it as	an ancient manu gesture intended to propitiate the devil.	4.63479892887524
14251. a	half-hour passed; we had drifted closer.	5.219666477665999
14252. in a voice so frightened as	to seem not his own the big bo'sun's mate quavered:   tchalo!	it is eromonga- look hard you can see with your	naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff.	4.9293478002219375
14253. i squinted	at the looming shoreline.	6.316170410054584
14254. there was a wooden tower or derrick there	something like a ski jump; it was perhaps 80 feet high and had	been artfully constructed of logs.	5.441975861110394
14255. a fine example of engineering in	a primitive society.	4.616908371843052
14256. what is the scaffolding for brassnose?	9.980877994804239
14257. 	he made a sound of despair deep in his throat.	4.479187976702888
14258. it was	embarrassing to see strapping blonde brassnose comport himself like	a child who talks about bogeymen.	5.683937991609345
14259. aaa-ee! it is their	tultul the 'jumping platform' of death.	4.477601198394805
14260. it is the last of the	three tests of manhood which the women impose to discover if a male	in worthy of survival there.	5.3794615392590535
14261. often i heard my uncles and cousins speak	of it when i was a small boy growing up in rabaul.	4.447266827929213
14262. they had never	seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers.	6.605674075694745
14263. our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what i had	heard of the inhabitants of eromonga i was glad to see a long and	graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon	into the open sea and toward our craft.	3.5157163499500266
14264. i expected brassnose-	as a man with a strain of melanesian in his blood- to speak to	them.	6.1542346145882245
14265. but he had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked.	5.183461179692465
14266. so i mustered my few words of the manu dialect and	said we greet you in peace.	6.0095938237146695
14267. my friends and i	come from a ship which was destroyed by fire.	4.541761873959221
14268. we are thirsty and hungry;	our sore and burned hands and arms need attention.	6.254510895051564
14269. the	girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me.	3.8101576301595865
14270. i noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland	of red pandanus fruit in her blue-black hair.	5.4462250713388975
14271. she said my	name is songau and these girls are ponkob and piwen.	4.70196720721318
14272. you are welcome	to eromonga.	12.218896146248996
14273. my people await you on the shore.	5.529290414052048
14274. you shall have	food water and rest.	8.907651622822808
14275. thirty minutes later the outrigger grated	on sand and other girls waiting on shore rushed forward to pull	it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder.	3.7553937854578088
14276. i saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there.	7.128239839898295
14277. all my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished	at the sight.	4.138413310200031
14278. there was a mound of bleached human bones and skulls	at the base of the big wooden derrick.	7.081713126964617
14279. some had been there for years;	others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them.	4.048875582775725
14280. there was one object which sickened yet fascinated me.	7.462300340811682
14281. this	was also a corpse- a male judging from the coral arm bands the	tribal scars still discernible on the maggoty face the painted bone of	the warrior caste which still pierced the septum of the rotting nose.	3.193188690134151
14282. the body may have been two or three weeks' dead.	7.388803907226357
14283. i looked	with revulsion at the legs.	5.79847623263147
14284. many small bones protruded	crazily from the shreds of flesh.	6.949766176676143
14285. the man must have leaped to	his death from the topmost rung of the tultul.	4.036176982509935
14286. as if divining	my thoughts the girl songau smiled warmly and said in the casual	tone an american woman might use in describing her rose garden:	this is our tultul a jumping platform maku.	4.774458092273864
14287. later	you shall know it better.	5.619635421798327
14288. is it not well-made?	13.159704920374146
14289.  our old one blew	down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons	ago.	4.808779183099722
14290. it took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one	which is higher and stronger than the old one.	5.3323993235077145
14291. we are very proud of	it.	7.289461837044228
14292. you have every right to be i replied gravely in	the manu dialect but my attention was fixed on brassnose the biggest	and strongest of us.	5.298940923876889
14293. he looked as if he was going to keel over.	6.903562655370652
14294. i	felt a queasiness in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these	girls that we were afraid.	5.087041715347147
14295. i clapped	the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily	hoping it would make an impression on the women: this one is the	maku frayne.	3.6068569081811725
14296. he speaks your language too for he is the grandson	of a chieftain on taui who made much magic and was strong and cunning.	5.227240983564443
14297. the maku frayne has inherited this strength from his grandfather.	3.873635296338494
14298. this was the worst thing i could have said.	8.052053624102252
14299. brassnose	turned a stricken face toward me and said brokenly sommers you	meddling yank you're a fool! they despise males who brag of	their strength; they destroy such men with their damned tests.	3.2653762695140407
14300. you've	ruined me blast you!   at first i thought he was out	of his head talking wildly like this.	5.50806409927881
14301. but a glance at songau and	the other women confirmed what brassnose had blurted out.	4.413177432397786
14302. the	women's faces had hardened after my statement.	6.743273855772659
14303. at a nod from songau	four lithe and muscular girls darted to frayne's side and seized	him by the arms.	4.160069109063295
14304. the man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle;	but four eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest	male that ever lived.	5.1589934724135365
14305. besides terror had sapped some of frayne's	vitality and will.	4.956013130418485
14306. my last impression as they led him off to	a stockade was of his pale face   in the manu tongue eromonga	means manhood- a quality which the women derisively toasted	in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were	imbibed.	4.491485569885868
14307. in the hut to which i was assigned- max had his own quarters-	my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping	breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases.	3.3452810873473555
14308. her name was l'turu and she told me many things.	6.534977782878914
14309. for	an anthropologist loquacious old l'turu was a mine of information.	4.317068102383446
14310. though i had a great dread of the island and felt i would never	leave it alive i eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its	women.	5.239607133504144
14311. from l'turu	i heard that until about 1850 the people of this island- which	was about the size of guam or smaller- had been of both sexes	and that the normal family life of melanesian tribes was observed here	with minor variations.	3.7083699966180426
14312. but in the middle of the last century	an island woman named karipo seized a spear in the heat of an	inter-tribal	battle and rallied the women after their men had fled.	5.890130852560503
14313. miraculously	karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders	from the isle of pamasu back to their war canoes after considerable	loss of life on both sides.	3.4811292086597514
14314. karipo was something of a	politician as well as a militarist.	7.863379949150179
14315. she quickly exploited the exalted	position she now occupied by harassing the disorganized males and even	putting many of them to death.	4.360533012034467
14316. within a decade or less few men	were left and a feminist society had sprung up.	5.907791263698283
14317. karipo was	great goddess told our mothers that men were not necessary except to	father children the crone told me.	3.632711015013689
14318. all men went away from here.	8.22499876492976
14319. those who stayed had to pass tests.	6.1113657531757495
14320. she cackled with	mirth showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth.	6.713816465488134
14321. karipo's women	then named this place 'eromonga'- manhood- for just the strongest	men could stay here.	3.8849121559715263
14322. the old woman	arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood.	5.24792741790534
14323. in	the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling i saw four	figures in a semi-circle on the ground.	4.20072988173758
14324. i guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized	then headed for home.	5.796167530887522
14325. maybe to beat up on his squaw.	5.606964162165314
14326. benson looked	up and saw ramey's long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the	stiff edge of the overall bib.	5.1725881625505306
14327. ramey reached out with the tire iron	and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack.	3.542415248362911
14328. i'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't	understand the liquor or automobiles.	6.181354537915761
14329. somehow the thought of a simple	man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand	moved the driver.	4.089221215723076
14330. for a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless	drivers softened.	7.80470101642271
14331. maybe the indian wasn't too much at fault	ramey thought.	5.0066500831780685
14332. maybe he was only doing the best he knew how like any	of us.	6.4919588294147585
14333. anyway he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be	stared at.	4.675983743880831
14334. ever see yourself spread out on the pavement benny?	7.603573301717785
14335. 	he said to his partner.	5.619635421798327
14336. you mean dream?	12.998525665852295
14337. 	not exactly.	8.12896173865557
14338. benson grinned and flipped a rock	with his thumb like a marble.	5.739974350684024
14339. nope just you all the time-	sometimes i think it's the only way i'll ever get a decent	partner.	4.128020475913787
14340. ramey smiled but he thought to himself i always	see me too.	5.739974350684024
14341. whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt	ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out	thoughts in his own mind.	3.7792657901381737
14342. then he would realize they were really things	that only he himself could think.	6.277439678276542
14343. with this realization sometimes	he saw himself as he looked down.	5.204112039509013
14344. you seen him yet?	11.1064335578917
14345. 	benson said referring to the indian.	5.219666477665999
14346. he wasn't in the	car ramey said.	7.5139871259533155
14347. you didn't go clear around benson	said.	6.490824436842797
14348. if you want to see something he's back on the other	side by the trunk of the car.	6.939015034914445
14349. too long a waiting line	ramey answered pretending to joke.	5.200566676397886
14350. a few minutes later the	insurance man a road checker drove up in the gray coupe with license	plates on it from a far-away state.	5.764336962593406
14351. it was a trick they used to try	and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their	speed.	4.204196672632243
14352. sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar	on the trucks as they passed.	6.754742931623726
14353. all the drivers knew about the plates	and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges	the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping	cane.	3.685531998114811
14354. horsely an agent on the east end wore the hat trying to	look like a tourist.	5.61195068722065
14355. it had always seemed strange to ramey that to	disguise himself as a tourist an ex-truck driver like horsely would	merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head.	3.7875703777117296
14356. the insurance	man informed them that he had talked to crumley who was all	right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they	towed the rig back to town.	5.206672272329491
14357. he chatted with ramey and benson for a	minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer.	3.9520080690298083
14358. every so often the	diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for	the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear.	4.967921580286485
14359. when they	were ready to leave benson and ramey walked back around the rear of	the trailer.	4.117575039702405
14360. there's a body you won't mind looking at	benson said and they stopped.	5.791244613188262
14361. she had driven up with her husband	in a convertible with eastern license plates although the two drivers	knew nothing at the moment about that.	4.11195276114866
14362. she wore shorts and a loose	terry-cloth shirt.	7.905020216934477
14363. slender and tanned her dark brown hair was drawn	straight back simply.	4.182602481535312
14364. what outfit does she drive for?	8.356620097469762
14365. 	benson said.	8.12896173865557
14366. seeing her caused a lurch in ramey a recognition.	6.2082570457271595
14367. she might have been someone he had once loved.	5.554263381366741
14368. he had never seen	her before but now he thought of the manner in which he and benson	went in and out of the cities at each end of their run.	6.767792337480289
14369. the truck	routes the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed	briefly through his mind- back alleys were their access to a city	and they could never stay.	3.2574940781865815
14370. how would you ever see her again?	7.880231792260334
14371.  the feeling	subsided it was only a small yearning.	4.860752527171498
14372. what's she doing in this bunch?	7.163184125958424
14373.  benson said and ramey	wondered how close their thoughts might have been.	4.182602481535312
14374. the girl	looked around at the countryside.	6.5206289086337845
14375. her glance swung past the trailer	where the two drivers were standing.	4.584184976644379
14376. it made only a tiny bump over	the two	men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on.	6.047931271869732
14377. she began	to watch a blonde-haired man also in shorts standing right at the rear	of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured	slightly.	3.9670428400536344
14378. what had caught his attention was obscured by the car	itself so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see but	benson knew what it was.	4.840749596262136
14379. the girl took a couple of steps toward the	man in shorts when benson in that barefoot courtliness ramey could	never decide was real said you don't want to go around there	ma'am.	3.437887727406748
14380. the girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge	that someone had spoken to her.	4.946488992977533
14381. the man stood near the bent	levi-clad body of the indian who lay face down almost under the car.	4.096474765884619
14382. the two drivers moved closer.	7.843242247330655
14383. what does he want a spoon?	7.0414581117778585
14384. 	benson said to ramey.	8.457718703298294
14385. one tiny detail in a happening can	clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth while the rest	of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain.	3.56884580536314
14386. with ramey it was	a dusty work shoe that was half-off the indian's foot that he would	always remember.	5.451210204065967
14387. the laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets	but there was still a bow knot at the top.	4.010563640339829
14388. the slightest twitch would	have parted the shoe entirely from the foot yet the toes were still	inside.	4.762782422141702
14389. the two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed	man.	4.5231330721596645
14390. he wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red v	at the neck the sleeves pushed above the elbows.	5.377806011036096
14391. he turned and looked	at them with clear blue eyes immaculate eyes.	4.569244096247681
14392. he was very tanned-	big hands might have torn him from a coca-cola poster.	6.148998479236768
14393. he's	dead isn't he?	6.939425769494729
14394.  the man said.	10.52709250839424
14395. he turned and bent over	the body of the indian.	5.185432909315228
14396. there was nothing in particular on the man's	face.	8.206560219549486
14397. it was simply a matter of curiosity a natural right to examine.	5.218115370275006
14398. what's this?	11.155741451300253
14399.  the man said backing up a step	still looking down.	4.725851684042368
14400. his words were mostly to himself.	7.540633229048254
14401. there was a gentle concern in benson's voice.	6.420098635034349
14402. ramey looked	down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man's tanned	leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded blood-flecked substance lying by	itself on the pavement.	5.293442962151119
14403. but what is it?	8.756150647488008
14404.  the man said	with a tone of impatience.	7.187309145236416
14405. but what is it?	8.756150647488008
14406.  the man had	spoken only once.	8.337226340439551
14407. ramey heard the words again inside weakened the	way moving water sounds through a grove of trees until he was not sure	whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears.	3.471533105683157
14408. the sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and ramey's	vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man's	leg.	4.5782298233157475
14409. ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown	skin.	4.182602481535312
14410. he stared at the shining shining circles of hairs and heard the	voice of his partner through trees don't do that fella.	4.900707183300939
14411. the man seemed to sink a little as ramey brought	the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde	head was turning as he hit the man again with his fist.	3.363694819908898
14412. ramey swung	and caught the man just to the left of his mouth.	5.923052491190303
14413. it was a straight	solid once-in-a-lifetime shot; he laid all four knuckles in between	the man's cheekbone and his chin.	4.0969050762110975
14414. ramey's fist and the air expelled	from the man's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like	cupped hands clapping together.	5.327011858346143
14415. the man took two short steps	backward then sat down heavily on the pavement.	4.137450731388251
14416. ramey heard a cry from	the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand.	5.2288514545018705
14417. as he watched	the man sit suddenly a detached part of his mind observed how very	difficult it was really to knock a man off his feet.	3.900706866001973
14418. he hadn't	done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard.	6.152977195701084
14419. with a thoughtful look the man sat on the pavement legs straight out	in front of him.	4.234118380080352
14420. his arms hung like empty shirt sleeves and his mouth	was slightly open.	5.765327675605419
14421. after what seemed several seconds the open mouth	grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it.	3.9629388780220025
14422. the man brought	one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he	touched his mouth.	5.229352251850695
14423. he moaned and pulled the hand away.	5.131969917669621
14424. even yet there	was no realization in his eyes.	7.429640777732737
14425. ramey could hear the crowd	coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his	shoulder had no identity or importance to him.	3.6504511524933347
14426. he did not look around.	10.905341734287722
14427. he's hurt!	a woman's voice said and then he heard a sort of wail from	the man's wife.	4.256174240421481
14428. the man on the ground began to move; one of his	hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him.	6.178661323137233
14429. blood dripped	down the front of his sweater soaking into a dark streak of dirt that	ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder as though the	bright v woven into the neckline had melted running a darker color.	3.3060835499920747
14430. the girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back.	5.244616224616532
14431. can you hear can you talk to me?	5.686623709664579
14432.  she begged.	13.515432363756661
14433. an incoherent	puzzled sound came from the red mouth.	6.095968989278338
14434. the girl looked around quickly	at several of the people.	6.228379885194416
14435. none of the crowd had stepped forward to	help.	6.1766845975005635
14436. then she saw ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment.	6.481931646858717
14437. why did you do it- why did you hit him?	5.1440640549552255
14438.  she said	her voice rising.	9.76679032060516
14439. a shine in her eyes suddenly	became tears and she turned back to her husband again.	3.782553131683091
14440. behind	ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers.	6.743273855772659
14441. no one seemed	to know for sure what had happened nor was there any purpose or responsibility	in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver	beyond finding out.	3.707326475474491
14442. ramey looked around and caught sight of his	partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman.	5.548371801815384
14443. benson moved his arms gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and	talking rapidly.	4.182602481535312
14444. ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man.	6.900907201860409
14445. some of	the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at ramey.	4.299593619163053
14446. it's	all over now the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk	rapidly down along the trailer toward them.	5.174141700785529
14447. ramey watched him coming	with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer.	4.017891729317595
14448. he saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman's	swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and	rolled at the side of his stocky body the sun left a smoky shine on	the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of	his pistol.	4.996424607505152
14449. all right step back! the patrolman said	to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball	cap and a young boy in levis.	3.903601171282868
14450. he walked straight up to the man sitting	on the ground and bent over to look at him.	7.098037268421245
14451. you all right?	9.469209290928912
14452. 	mough- it's my mough the man said trying	to talk without moving his lips.	5.448482501884564
14453. his brown face looked gray from dirt	streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across	it.	3.666265512281535
14454. then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the	venomous head- caught in the wicker back of the chair the eyes dead	on him as the life finally went out of the brute.	5.474645485348555
14455. the body continued	to lash but now keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome	bloody mass out of the bungalow.	3.8311146380951984
14456. he slammed the door and listened	as his servants ran up alarmed at the sound of the shots.	5.53836036354776
14457. he heard	their chattering and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered	the snake right on the porch with wood axes.	4.191944090299787
14458. it was only then	that he turned to look at penny.	8.818160127811112
14459. she was sitting on the edge	of the bed again back in the same position where the snake had found	her.	4.934234460974109
14460. the fear had not entirely gone from her face but there were some	other emotions now crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth.	4.771885960510443
14461. but her hands were calm now.	6.1707349663186655
14462. she's got guts thought	keith.	8.457718703298294
14463. she's got more guts than any other woman in the world.	4.7090239537402026
14464. keith said penny keith you were wonderful.	6.743273855772659
14465. i	don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving	her life but i am.	3.847366928554821
14466. he smiled at her	sincerity.	8.978600574448244
14467. and for the hundredth time that week he was startled at her	beauty.	5.147090259553113
14468. seven years they'd been married.	9.293503959758791
14469. he knew her	mind pretty well by now its quick perceptions and sympathies its painful	insistence on truth and directness its capacity for love almost	too deep for a man to reciprocate even in part.	3.6741639774805286
14470. but her beauty always	surprised him anew.	8.468378381140486
14471. i realize that this is hardly the time	to say it penny said keith.	5.009672992238117
14472. but knowing you i know that	you're glad to be alive and grateful- and sorry because i killed	the snake even though i had to.	4.880707905659378
14473. isn't that so?	6.939425769494729
14474.    penny	lowered her eyes.	9.52328749892442
14475. yes she said almost in a whisper	as if admitting to a crime.	4.5134861946105325
14476. the snake was beautiful wasn't	it?	6.5155523300336915
14477.  asked keith his voice getting harsher in spite of himself	as he struggled to control his growing anger.	4.36166546666778
14478. it was a king	cobra the largest you ever saw and it deserved to live out its life	in the jungle didn't it?	5.344549037587056
14479.  didn't it?	8.12896173865557
14480. 	penny	did not answer.	9.52328749892442
14481. now she just sat there looking at him without an expression	except concern for him.	4.207089879127219
14482. we're all god's creatures	aren't we?	7.712079578137997
14483.  keith was snarling now.	6.162967476035402
14484. all of us- every	goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle.	6.609215705459499
14485. you love this village	and these stinking brown people because they're god's creatures	too.	4.662112653877868
14486. and you love ahmiri that black bastard of a servant even	a little more because he's a beautiful man.	5.390843697074443
14487. and he loves you because	you're a beautiful woman.	5.740341345595739
14488. we're all god's creatures aren't	we penny?	7.163184125958424
14489.  all of us that is except me.	7.241635280523187
14490. you hate me you	hate my guts because i like to hunt.	7.482330116471141
14491. you actually hate me- and we	both know it- because i killed that filthy snake.	4.384988773997789
14492. h well why don't	you	say something?	9.082903487847283
14493.    penny would not rise to his mood.	4.913686410369733
14494. there isn't anything left to say is there keith?	7.417090035624861
14495. 	she softly let herself into the bed and took her regular side	away from the door where she slept better because keith was between	her and the invader.	3.4084860832301502
14496. he knew she was not sulking not even angry at	him.	7.20150442285534
14497. just as he knew that she had stopped loving him.	6.562248665477362
14498. the brahmaputra	has its headwaters in the tableland of the world the towering	white headwalls of the himalayas that are unknown to man as any	other space on the planet.	5.035230939469279
14499. for a brief period each year the rays of	the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep	at the base of the headwalls and then the pinnacles glisten in the	daytime at high noon and billions of gallons of water begin their slow	seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys	on their long meandering journey to the sea- running east past the	sky-carving massifs of gurla mandhata and kemchenjunga then turning	south and curling down through the jungles of assam past the khasi	hills and into bengal past sirinjani and madaripur until the	hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields	and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the	bay of bengal.	3.1224534634162806
14500. keith sterling had looked down on the brahmaputra	more times than he could remember during the war days when	he flew over the hump of the world thinking it high adventure in those	times before man was guiding himself through outer space.	5.0385767075311305
14501. but keith	looked down more than up.	6.079754166126456
14502. he thought of the jungles below him and	of the wild strange untracked beauty there and he promised himself	that someday he would return on foot perhaps to hunt in this last corner	of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted and animals	the lords.	4.524684949173183
14503. at first it had been just a romantic dream of his	the same as the idea of finishing oxford after the war.	4.657639494320138
14504. but after	the war was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself.	6.5365723311915795
14505. wing	commanders in the raf do not imply survival in the future either	in their orders or in their attitudes to their men or to themselves.	3.6462503847960672
14506. and keith's record of kills made him a man to listen to- a	man paradoxically who might even survive.	5.619688186330795
14507. he became a fighter pilot	after the stint over the hump in the big crates.	4.538458323005503
14508. the raf was britain's	weapon of attrition and flying a fighter plane was the way	her sons could serve her best at this point in the war.	5.079720052746781
14509. he knew	how to shoot down nazis.	5.475289483739853
14510. and he knew that the men talked about him	behind his back saying that he was one up on everybody else- including	the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it- because he was	chemically incapable of fear.	5.279888354998982
14511. that was true but only half the truth.	5.84671862141056
14512. the other half he didn't like to recognize even to himself.	6.638926669540445
14513. not defending england or being an ace or fighting	for humanity.	4.905787024953939
14514. and he would have enjoyed it	just as much if he had been a nazi.	9.358006420545177
14515. nowadays we talk as though	the blitz were just a short skirmish.	4.2069352543281004
14516. the nazis bombed britain	so the raf retaliated and shot them all down.	5.07801536066223
14517. it	was a war of nerves of stamina of dogged endurance in which the stupid	insistence of the british on their right to their own country became	ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the nazis who were better	organized and technically superior.	3.745562746638784
14518. it took a long time before the	british tipped the balance.	8.576086873207185
14519. keith learned too much about air	combat and air killing to be risked.	4.183519862462597
14520. they grounded him	and put	him	in the command offices.	7.2676208602133485
14521. that was where he met penny.	6.830992039465306
14522. he was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking american wac	a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work	in the command offices	but that was all.	5.192588732377201
14523. penny knew him better on her part.	4.913686410369733
14524. he had a war	reputation but this was the kind of man women like even without medals.	7.705844814843193
14525. they don't go for bull-like muscle as a rule.	4.770496407217191
14526. he had strength	in his six-foot frame but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier.	6.355819133732763
14527. he was on the thin side with big hands and the kind of wrists that	give away the power in forearm and bicep.	4.6116783519420945
14528. his hair was black	already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom the only	one permitted to a man.	5.103067928688616
14529. the pretty little twittering wacs said	he had the look of eagles- and penny hating the cliche had to	admit that in this case it applied.	3.5945533204674076
14530. penny	and keith had no romance.	7.712079578137997
14531. but they met	in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly.	4.920278907651501
14532. the command offices were in the border country up north where the	radar systems centralized their intelligence reports and the fighters	were dispatched to harry the enemy.	4.832922395143027
14533. the nazis knew this of course	and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers they let	a few drop every time they went over hoping for a lucky hit.	3.1635923768508603
14534. this	time they had been lucky.	9.473268745149264
14535. the command post was underground and	well camouflaged.	4.543606307658987
14536. but there hadn't been enough time to build it for	keeps.	7.262134378602364
14537. there was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and	ceiling but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that	concrete is not much better than prayer if as efficacious when a	direct hit comes along.	3.769008875373741
14538. this one was actually more of a near	miss.	8.213803512556098
14539. the bomb plunged into the ground near the post but not	precisely into the command room itself.	3.564084235581746
14540. there was a shattering cracking	sound as the concrete started to buckle the air filled with dust	and flying debris and everyone in the room- men and women hit the	floor and used the desks as turtlebacks as ordered.	5.010029775041443
14541. that is	everyone but keith and penny.	6.115397952348643
14542. they stood there just the two	of them in the rocking shattering blast.	6.67967571880195
14543. keith was on his feet because	he didn't care at all about life any more: penny on her feet	proudly because she cared too much.	3.5528951017694888
14544. the bomb was a solitary	one.	6.641096338844875
14545. the blast damaged but did not destroy the room.	4.156487394441598
14546. keith's eyes	met penny's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction.	5.448482501884564
14547. and as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks	and tend to those wounded and mark the several killed he climbed across	the debris to penny and took her hand in his.	3.7148016633776955
14548. the chaplain	married them on the next day.	6.529938240787837
14549. after the war penny had wanted	keith at least to visit her home with her.	4.781527608396291
14550. she came from ohio	from what she called a small farm of two hundred acres as indeed	it was to farmer-type farmers.	5.201222793802925
14551. but to keith's london-bred mind	such acreage sounded rather invincible.	5.364583732656767
14552. it wasn't that however which	decided them not to go to america.	7.895102902594078
14553. keith told penny about his	dream to return to india and burma.	4.709206849721117
14554. he stressed the wild beauty of	the mountains and the jungles.	6.547955527965972
14555. he didn't tell her the truth he now	freely admitted to himself.	4.318068015596563
14556. that was his	true love not penny.	9.374478992291147
14557. the terrible power of a gun the thing that	blasted the soul out of a living body man or beast was one he never	wanted to lose.	3.560370685120799
14558. and in the hunting land this hunger was considered	to be a noble thing.	6.774155603446806
14559. when they got to shillong in assam	he was happy.	5.508145394521753
14560. this is a paradise for hunters.	9.311135451838911
14561. this was the land of the	sladang the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the	spread.	4.478835798744697
14562. the sambur buck the jungle stag	that is even more noble than the scottish elk.	5.042445073796411
14563. he even hunted elephant	although the asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his african	cousin.	4.096653530098603
14564. but there are big rogues in both countries.	8.599650373835123
14565. these were	the ones keith sought out- the loners the ones who killed for the	joy of it like himself.	3.844438991612545
14566. he and penny would go out on tame elephants	raised from babyhood in the keddah.	5.792183372900975
14567. and while he was ever	alert for game and most particularly a tiger penny marvelled at the	eden they were traversing.	4.313587017358019
14568. they came upon cheetal deer at woodland	pools.	7.552118183144029
14569. peacocks strutted across their path preening.	5.219666477665999
14570. there were fantastic	flowers without perfume and gaudy birds without song.	7.067000175280529
14571. mouse	deer played around the feet of the elephants or fled when the mighty	legs thrashed too close.	3.930072649718237
14572. wild boar watched their progress with little	pig eyes and grunted derision when they didn't consider such game	worthy of a shot from the .	4.714137561967006
14573. now the next morning they were anchored at the elbow and the boat	was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned	to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms	with the weighted line beside it; and robinson roy who had gone	down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free	dive was already back on the surface.	3.1432655416440918
14574. he and his safety man	herr schaffner swam up to the boarding ladder together.	7.427076930346382
14575. the german	courteously indicated that robinson should mount first.	4.1174608023645085
14576. robinson	clambered heavily into the boat sat down and stripped off his triple-tank	assembly.	5.583228874976599
14577. he took his mask from his forehead	and threw it unexpectedly across the deck.	4.3099126219259425
14578. temper temper	mrs forsythe said laughing uneasily.	7.163184125958424
14579. a phony blonde hanging	onto a bygone youth and beauty but irreparably stringy in the neck	she was already working on her second gin and tonic though it was	not yet ten am   i loused it rob said with a	savage note in his voice.	3.10349965976109
14580. all i have to do to set the record is to	go on down.	7.794511370993737
14581. so instead i come up.	6.618388707173994
14582. was it my equipment?	10.913010008089081
14583. 	the german asked.	6.939425769494729
14584. was it something went bad with the breathing?	7.599801417246125
14585. 	the equipment was fine rob stated standing	up.	4.913686410369733
14586. he was a huge young man of twenty-four clothed in muscle immensely	strong with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that	was submerged under his present agitation.	5.185592971950131
14587. he stared stonily at the	floor.	5.926245264679889
14588. i was down to 275.	9.893163330007317
14589. i've been that far half a dozen times.	5.380135323369896
14590. i don't get it why this time i should pull such a stupid trick.	5.65219859595529
14591. well i get it artie said still on the ladder.	4.915610685009064
14592. you	are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting	a record.	5.448482501884564
14593. and you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that	tells you to turn around before you drown yourself.	3.8637479160138275
14594. no it wasn't that rob said.	8.22112540639696
14595. a note of awe came	into his voice.	5.219680121406264
14596. when i came up damnit i thought i was going	down.	7.523183334395391
14597. i came up maybe fifty feet before i knew what was happening.	4.600008558637987
14598. pressure-happy artie said and climbed in.	7.163184125958424
14599. i was expecting it sure.	7.2089467593860705
14600. but when it happens to you like that i tell you and you're a	hundred feet from where you thought you were- well it makes you think.	5.034925338480138
14601. you don't head back down again.	6.490824436842797
14602. not right away.	12.297773116285894
14603. he had his voice under control again: no one became aware that	he was terrified by what had just happened to him.	4.035330744181653
14604. waddell	the newspaperman was a fellow in his middle forties with a graying crewcut	heavy-framed glasses and a large jaw padded with fat.	4.907727580354789
14605. now he	was going to show how much he knew.	4.999814772210046
14606. our boy didn't chicken out	no sir.	8.073986782498558
14607. he ran into the rapture of the depths.	5.471137571644746
14608. it	makes the diver feel drunk.	7.712079578137997
14609. well that's the only way	to be mrs forsythe said and gave her brassy laugh.	4.512785682516659
14610. maybe not if you're 200 feet under water artie said.	6.571880739425066
14611. it's nothing to fool with.	5.619635421798327
14612. personally i don't blame him for giving up the dive	much as i regret losing the story.	5.4575941075780205
14613. nobody's giving	anything up robinson said.	5.619635421798327
14614. he stood there towering over them	all: gentle mighty determined the moving force in the group; and	yet like a child among adults.	5.136889446363411
14615. you think i got you and artie and	herr schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride?	4.418606106266581
14616.  i'm	going down again.	9.52328749892442
14617. that's my boy! mr forsythe	exclaimed.	5.619635421798327
14618. rob's not going to give up as easy as all that.	7.168195172719814
14619. he was a florid puffy man in his early sixties very natty in his	yachting cap striped jacket and white flannels.	4.286117212257779
14620. he went to key west	every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know	that his title of commodore was never used without irony.	5.889978720782614
14621. old	commodore forsythe who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether	he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without	accidentally turning on something else first.	3.41999109118862
14622. now it did not occur	to him even to wonder whether it was wise for robinson to dive again:	rob was his boy the kid he had rescued from the streets the object	of his pride.	4.8295527617383005
14623. why he went on when rob asked me	if he could make his dive on this trip i didn't think twice about	it.	3.929694982887952
14624. i've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around	his brother's tackle shop.	6.009129621797265
14625. hell i gave him the first decent	job he ever had six seven- how many years ago was it rob?	4.0579040328064755
14626. 	seven years ago commodore rob said impassively.	6.743273855772659
14627. he was	thinking big deal: skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven	years and no better off than when i started.	3.642730450128259
14628. excuse me he	said abruptly.	8.457718703298294
14629. he went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters;	went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him.	3.8481346469649242
14630. when you gotta go you gotta go mrs forsythe said.	7.2177331463504215
14631. waddell muttered something about taking a look around and	climbed up to the flying bridge.	4.420714060232851
14632. he was disturbed by what had happened	on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the	night before with the german who had come out of the head while he	was fixing himself a drink in the galley.	5.072837410310814
14633. hi there schaffner	he had said.	5.619635421798327
14634. can i make you one?	9.416333258945464
14635.    no thank	you very much schaffner had answered in his accented english.	4.584901709342695
14636. i do not drink so much thank you.	8.207870968921418
14637. waddell had looked the	man over trying to size him up.	4.317068102383446
14638. he was in his early forties rather	short and very compactly built and with a manner that was reserved	and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to american ways.	5.952154813115964
14639. his	open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence until one looked into	his eyes which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence.	3.6610072617923577
14640. waddell had heard that he had been a commando in rommel's afrika	corps and he said to himself: i'd hate to run into him in the desert	on a dark night.	6.096936034148307
14641. aloud he had said making conversation:	rob tells me he's using your atlantis equipment on the dive.	3.744109221929566
14642. yes herr schaffner had said.	9.27537736129135
14643. he's one	hell of a decent boy.	5.219666477665999
14644. i agree yes.	11.067037043475061
14645. and if the dive goes ok he has the exclusive import	rights to your line for this country is that right?	4.387470693068561
14646.    well	no herr schaffner said.	8.457718703298294
14647. waddell turned to face him.	5.619635421798327
14648. but that's what he told me.	7.8672625272876715
14649. why that's	his main reason for making the dive.	5.421199734113007
14650. shaffner looked at	him altogether without guile and shrugged his shoulders making a	little spreading gesture with his two hands.	4.985333447698777
14651. what do you mean?	9.188024454579084
14652. 	waddell asked frowning.	9.52328749892442
14653. please let me explain	the german said earnestly his face still devoid of deceit.	3.9701983041559052
14654. i have	in europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year.	6.035113616999736
14655. now	i wish to enter the american market where the competition is very	strong.	4.4664696313230765
14656. i must have a powerful representative here a firm with a national	distribution and ten twenty thousand dollars to advertise my	products.	5.565185869988639
14657. with all respect to a fine young man mr roy is not able	to provide these necessaries.	4.501249249431201
14658. waddell was not an eminently	moral person but he did not like what he had just heard.	6.63781487724594
14659. did you	tell him all this?	6.451854159528076
14660.  he asked.	12.081077223713681
14661. perhaps not in so many	words the german said.	5.422638444068971
14662. but surely you have misunderstood mr	roy.	7.8672625272876715
14663. never never did i offer him the exclusive rights.	4.915445832768956
14664. we spoke	of the need for advertising and i agreed that the deep dive would	be most useful for publicity.	5.967671957904232
14665. he was most eager to make the dive;	of course i was willing.	5.2052693513941115
14666. but there was no definite agreement about	business arrangements.	9.41414573188082
14667. there	was the end of his front-page feature story with byline.	5.904977722245812
14668. he started	out the door.	8.978600574448244
14669. one moment! herr schaffner said.	6.541981858488372
14670. you	intend to speak with mr roy?	7.163184125958424
14671.    what else?	10.509353167850248
14672. 	waddell asked.	11.155741451300253
14673. if you will pardon i think it would be	better if not.	6.165703147190585
14674. mr roy is determined to make this dive.	7.2201369635220285
14675. whatever	you tell him he will dive.	5.219666477665999
14676. i know this from my talks with him.	7.812255642330302
14677. well let's let him make up his own mind ok?	5.076611340023956
14678.  waddell	said.	13.921774766768346
14679. on the basis of the facts.	8.497144741988276
14680. you will make	him unhappy and anxious the german said.	7.650551846767301
14681. at 200 300 400 feet	under the water when he must be paying very much attention he will	be thinking about what you are telling him.	3.8460148910289744
14682. it is not good mr	waddell: you will do him great harm.	7.205927719873811
14683. there was no doubt	that herr schaffner meant every word of what he said.	5.344776841382989
14684. waddell came	back from the door and sat on a bunk.	6.142128492906275
14685. i am an honest man	the german said with fervor.	5.248781851068306
14686. i will give mr roy his due for	this dive.	7.157110869860304
14687. i will make him distributor for all of florida- a big	market.	4.97151563004875
14688. all tourists come to florida.	9.001313582608027
14689. this will help him to get out	of his little tackle shop.	4.786546632294512
14690. yes! but there is no use causing him	to worry at this time.	7.831223994274884
14691. the german's words worked on the	newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty.	3.6311862882065773
14692. he took a big swig	of his drink.	7.982948451618467
14693. it would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like	this.	5.567073643418646
14694. i think maybe you're right schaffner he said.	7.983238917174883
14695. he	has the distributorship for florida you say?	4.9630701837032785
14696.    yes	the german said.	9.52328749892442
14697. at least for south florida.	7.7302309592798535
14698. by	god waddell said we don't want to upset the boy at this	time of all times.	5.474289424614324
14699. he sloshed his drink	around and drained it in a few large gulps.	5.180082800572258
14700. the story was shaping up	nicely in his mind: the young pioneer as of old altruistically braving	the unknown; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business	america.	4.604781742124674
14701. join me in another?	6.760408715579149
14702.  he had asked.	12.873400287333043
14703. thank	you the german had said courteously.	5.219666477665999
14704. i do not drink so much.	9.633255951216901
14705. now in that same cabin robinson fell to his knees beside	a bunk.	4.707379724933393
14706. fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions.	6.412214371980113
14707. he pressed	his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers	in a hurried and anxious whisper.	4.047841671193874
14708. blessed saint nicholas	i thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up	instead of down when i was bewildered.	5.2489322244649985
14709. and when i make the dive again-	he paused; crossed himself; said a hail mary slowly and	with understanding.	4.184748640321429
14710. folding between his hands the cross that hung	from his neck he took his appeal direct to headquarters.	5.057556181613073
14711. holy mary	mother of god star of the sea stay thou with me on this next	dive.	4.27266635612947
14712. make it come off all right.	8.470510810011577
14713. let me set the record this time	and let me get back ok so the german will give me the exclusive.	3.928110393384005
14714. and make my life different and better from this time on.	6.29805775452702
14715. he crossed himself again and rose.	5.475289483739853
14716. he felt a good deal less	shaky.	10.648475778723999
14717. as he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when	he opened he found artie who came in and sat down on a bunk.	4.144144590352349
14718. artie	had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger.	5.956178200156034
14719. he waited	awhile before he said roy you know your decompression table	don't you?	4.191792515969988
14720.    you know i know it robinson answered	warily.	8.794557623077804
14721. you came straight up from 275 without a stop	artie said.	5.429246160981265
14722. well i was a little bit confused.	10.083677062167668
14723. anyway	i wasn't down long enough to matter.	4.913686410369733
14724. you don't see me stretched	out	on the deck do you?	7.376044069299254
14725.    you know what they say about two	deep dives in one day artie went on still twirling the snorkle and	studying it intently.	3.9326597927232796
14726. i don't think you should go down again.	7.479858467424763
14727. early that day matsuo saw a marine.	5.712354526377203
14728. the enemy came looming	around a bend in the trail and matsuo took a hasty shot then fled	without knowing the result ran until breath was a pain in his chest	and his legs were rubbery.	4.314471692313162
14729. as his feet slowed he felt ashamed of the	panic and resolved to make a stand.	4.584535012695118
14730. he crossed the next meadow and	climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed.	5.603893504423084
14731. in the leafiest	part of the tree straddling a broad horizontal limb he could see over	the meadow.	4.072441011523162
14732. for	a while he was content to let events develop in their	good time.	6.192384749636574
14733. he had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column	and while his shot had probably bred indecision they would soon come	hunting.	3.964370119575257
14734. his superiors had emphasized that marines tortured	others for the sheer pleasure.	5.939881127200001
14735. yesterday; today; tomorrow: no	surrender.	6.162967476035402
14736. his remembering the self-dictate brought no peace- only	a faint chill of doubt.	5.765327675605419
14737. he murmured to himself with firmness: no	surrender.	5.131969917669621
14738. it was best to die fighting the marines.	7.250318848208462
14739. his superiors	had also preached this saying it was the way for eternal honor.	5.51334392898101
14740. what if the marines never came?	9.511569522554852
14741.  his comrades were all dead.	5.949600585200961
14742. then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide.	9.51487067270803
14743. whichever the way he would rot in this vast choking green	his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes.	3.6109401244718335
14744. he sighed and leaned	for a moment against the trunk.	6.375016808455901
14745. his fingers touched the bone handle	of a knife.	4.876156150362605
14746. the knife an ammunition pouch and a half-filled bottle	of purified water hung on his belt.	4.827508206929211
14747. besides the belt he wore a loin	cloth.	5.996428291908048
14748. as he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer he saw	a marine in the jungle across the clearing.	5.5264230223872035
14749. the	marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed as though	debating whether to brave the sunlight.	4.345472343681463
14750. his fatigues made a streak	of almost phosphorescent green in the mist.	5.939881127200001
14751. come out come	out in the meadow matsuo said under his breath.	4.236009890772347
14752. the man	leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face.	5.078074081494962
14753. a signal?	7.943923314894583
14754. 	matsuo lifted his rifle easing the sling under his left upper arm for	steadiness.	5.599725778167043
14755. fresh on his mind were events of the past day when	his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills.	4.293806010806331
14756. they had fought from	caves and the marines resorted to burning them out.	6.4630326439678205
14757. even now like	a ringing in his ears he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting	great orange billows.	4.187609939957975
14758. a wave of flame rippling through their	cave had reached nagamo his friend and with a shriek the man bolted	through the entrance then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet his	uniform blazing.	4.8408956896095106
14759. the marines let him advance.	4.747750369463677
14760. when he sank on his knees	they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of	mercy.	6.052537483944972
14761. matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses	both the burned and the unburned the latter decomposing rapidly	under the tropical sun.	3.4050350161502263
14762. the callous marines had laughed at each other's	retching while stacking bodies.	5.187735111958531
14763. matsuo repeatedly choked down	his own nausea.	5.219666477665999
14764. at nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside	and into the jungle reeking of death.	6.7571033525717
14765. apprehensively he	peered	to the left to the right into the leafy vine-crisscrossed maze.	4.922216660819463
14766. he decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow with	the one left to distract him.	5.575833543546139
14767. cautious feet	stepping on leafmold; faint creaking of belts and slings; whispers:	he heard none of these.	3.8101576301595865
14768. only the hum of insects and the distant	fluttering call of a bird.	6.741549008485742
14769. because he couldn't hear them he was	more convinced they were there.	5.043911516692174
14770. a spectacle occurred across the	meadow: the lone marine took a seat on the ground; leaning sidewise	on a tree trunk he embraced it.	4.733673933452158
14771. while his comrades cocked the trap that one behaved as if it was some	dull maneuver.	4.815164317502836
14772. taking aim at the man's face matsuo squeezed the	trigger up to the point of discharge and then he changed his mind.	6.316063007517193
14773. he wanted the arrogant marine to know fear and so he aimed above the	head.	4.3904673605221785
14774. the shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound.	5.650577481330174
14775. like a mischievous boy expecting punishment matsuo	awaited reaction from the jungle.	4.815250138789905
14776. how stupid to give his position	away.	8.833278157382681
14777. the jungle did not retort.	4.747750369463677
14778. the sitter remained seated	hugging the tree.	6.1544293522411175
14779. before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy	and insects hummed and birds occasionally called.	4.198687505579637
14780. matsuo puzzled	and grew anxious over the complete passiveness concluding that he	was the butt of a devilish joke.	5.057556181613073
14781. five or so minutes later the	marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight immediately throwing	his hands over his eyes.	3.8155952151176358
14782. he went into a whirling dance a sort of	blind chasing of the tail.	6.2174725621125715
14783. it ended when he tumbled; but jumping right	up he staggered in no particular direction.	4.242386148039066
14784. he wore no head cover	of any kind and more odd had no visible weapon.	5.686650687706848
14785. with a sudden	decisiveness he lurched in matsuo's direction crossing the meadow	in a zigzagging gallop.	4.453799199853264
14786. when he got closer to the tree matsuo	noted the wild look on his face.	6.715791473617862
14787. the pockets of his jacket bulged.	4.573122576366096
14788. the bobbing head was a poor target so matsuo shot	him in the upper trunk.	5.150563019076642
14789. the marine spun clapping a hand high	on his chest and dived forward.	3.7002464386011096
14790. in the hush that followed the echoes	matsuo was tense.	6.714689360651815
14791. they could come on him now without difficulty.	5.431350297887743
14792. gradually he reached a conclusion.	9.27279748208192
14793. the marine was alone for they	were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from	the tree.	3.3563915519848933
14794. down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of	foliage.	6.022422786687989
14795. the marine was sprawled some thirty yards away one arm extended.	3.7801503613451746
14796. matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out.	6.412214371980113
14797. reflex?	10.144513917544229
14798. 	rifle leveled on the man he made a rush.	6.794164435399359
14799. heat in the sunlight pressed	in like an invisible crowd.	4.531011486798661
14800. he squatted by the head gently	placing the rifle	on the ground.	6.130331029301074
14801. with a snakestrike motion he grasped the	hair and twisting pulled the marine over on his back.	4.234118380080352
14802. the bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone;	around the hole blood glistened in a little patch.	6.176258986509274
14803. maintaining his	clutch on the hair matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in	the jacket pockets.	3.8101576301595865
14804. in one: a package of cigarettes and a tinplated	lighter both sticky from the man's bleeding.	5.415855590662447
14805. in the other: a	wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief.	4.372373552365046
14806. one	by one he tossed the objects aside.	6.743273855772659
14807. he didn't smoke and could not light	fires with a flintless lighter; he had no use any longer for exact	time even had the watch been running.	3.6802179559818637
14808. then there was no saying how	many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief.	6.632271471925687
14809. too bad the marine had no water.	5.870990386170498
14810. from its holder he took his own canteen.	7.668442228319353
14811. the cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied	pressure.	4.005318918510355
14812. the marine's eyes opened squeezed shut then opened squinted	in the glare.	5.187735111958531
14813. matsuo put the bottle to his	own lips.	4.913686410369733
14814. the marine reached up a hand.	6.154600117812017
14815. none	for you.	8.12896173865557
14816. the marine blinked soon dropping his hand.	5.874298389948056
14817. not only	had he no canteen but he lacked even the belt to hang one on.	4.186511249735338
14818. you	came well equipped to die.	7.712079578137997
14819. some odor made him lean over	the man.	5.411014586580643
14820. he sniffed and recognized it.	8.132854117812016
14821. so that had been his	difficulty.	8.03185080739759
14822. drunk on sake he must have wandered off from his	bivouac.	5.9245075971793435
14823. the marine tried to roll on his right side and moaned.	3.7801503613451746
14824. when he rolled on the left side propping on his left elbow matsuo	seized his hair and pulled him back over.	6.117947574345988
14825. awkwardly with one hand matsuo got the cap back on the water	bottle.	4.375601283484662
14826. the smell of sake had freshened yesterday's events in his	thoughts.	5.641986810243079
14827. in the caves with other supplies they had kept cases of	sake.	4.516771546030933
14828. the marine shut his eyes.	6.5154183870617475
14829. are you a thrower of	flame marine?	6.540775780757042
14830.  matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and	laid it on the ground out of the marine's reach and away from their	shadows.	6.103818305252526
14831. he waited in his squat gripping the hair.	4.862373123883983
14832. every	so often he turned the knife.	7.494253447486207
14833. its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight.	5.204466881930977
14834. the sun was noon high and matsuo perspired until his body was	dripping.	5.472287310595978
14835. wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an	oily film.	4.0683852436856025
14836. the man had thrown the left hand over his eyes.	6.227885271310969
14837. now and	again he murmured something that ended in a giggle.	4.782724544520212
14838. he must have saturated	himself in the drink for the bullet not to shock him out of his	drunken haze.	5.736700610540952
14839. at last he reached	for the knife.	6.898190777296024
14840. even the bone handle scorched and he retrieved	the marine's handkerchief to wrap it.	6.36775901441669
14841. first he barely touched the	blade on the hand which shaded the eyes.	4.550905047648956
14842. the marine yelled and flung	the hand away.	5.874298389948056
14843. with a firm grip on the man's hair matsuo applied the	blade flat on a cheek.	4.336727838454923
14844. a shrill yelp kicked legs and groping hands	that circled matsuo's wrist.	5.687349759414254
14845. matsuo wrenched free and burned the	hands into retreat; burned the other cheek; burned each hand when	they came groping again.	3.5853166747464886
14846. the marine commenced to weep and it blighted	the sense of enjoyment.	5.187671123813217
14847. a small measure	of payment marine.	6.1720204590375145
14848. he dropped the knife in its scabbard hung the	rifle behind a shoulder.	5.805330275473828
14849. the marine hands on cheeks rolled	by his unwounded side onto his stomach.	3.7002464386011096
14850. matsuo	walked toward his tree once glancing back.	6.743273855772659
14851. he would soon die.	7.715553877489498
14852. as matsuo climbed by using the vines	and kicking his feet against the trunk a mood of gloom immersed him like	a jungle shadow.	5.369828326060575
14853. what now?	10.509353167850248
14854.  in the jungle birds were mute while	insects preserved only the monotony of living.	6.115294404415157
14855. it was the marine: head lifted he strained and called.	5.323228116750962
14856. then he	astonished matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat.	6.2044028944784575
14857. he	cupped his mouth and yelled.	5.619635421798327
14858. matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder.	6.743273855772659
14859. once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die.	5.549476540054192
14860. it sounded as if the man were calling him: hey	japanese h hey there japanese.	6.302487971983299
14861. the man tilted back his	head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container.	4.070719973671098
14862. he	performed the act twice more and the begging in his tone grew more distinct.	5.331440467598945
14863. the marine nodded	vigorously.	5.58691050762224
14864. matsuo laughed slung the rifle.	7.712079578137997
14865. the marine	was a winehead.	5.098202453568707
14866. his superiors had said that all marines were depraved.	6.392399769526825
14867. the marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before	an idol.	3.7002464386011096
14868. remembering his own thirst matsuo took out his water bottle.	5.972660563754138
14869. one swallow was all he would have; he was very thirsty but he must	observe water discipline.	4.073055911056333
14870. his years of campaigning had taught him	the value of water discipline.	5.93931415753987
14871. he began to uncap the bottle	the rusty cap squealing on its threads.	4.87659573084493
14872. popping upright the marine waved	both hands and shouted.	6.412214371980113
14873. of course it was water he really	craved; down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out.	4.378921759286897
14874. the	marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack.	5.448482501884564
14875. he had no water for an enemy.	6.738860020715618
14876. and when this was	gone he hadn't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water	if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool.	5.425308874899139
14877. he capped the	bottle and replaced it.	5.475289483739853
14878. after all he had less reason to desire it	than the marine.	6.796133411985353
14879. before much longer the marine quieted down.	5.813139250105802
14880. the upper part of his packet had stained dark.	6.350713243786274
14881. there is nothing for you matsuo said.	6.889779148585125
14882. your superiors	will certainly beat you for your desertion besides the dishonor of it.	5.917775975842025
14883. from the convulsive quivers of	the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping.	4.313345410595077
14884. he reminded	matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in china.	5.925879823256658
14885. in china	it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform smudged blood-specked	with the village burning about him and shells exploding.	3.7657023057591426
14886. chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables	as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and	walked towards the bar.	4.714137561967006
14887. only blue throat and his gang stayed where	they were.	5.1298183412245
14888. blue throat was slumped with his back against the bar elbows	supporting his massive frame.	5.546070975384628
14889. he leered at the stranger as the	distance between them closed.	4.467047448170571
14890. since when did they allow beardless	kids into the saloon bars of this town boys?	5.818821427506145
14891.  he asked.	8.80323508231408
14892. seems	to me i don't remember altering any law about that.	5.9245075971793435
14893. he straightened up alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer.	4.318068015596563
14894. stay	right here where you are kid he called.	6.412214371980113
14895. i don't aim	to have minors breathing down my neck when i'm a-drinking:	the stranger ignored him.	4.026988402764935
14896. he didn't stop till he was within three	feet of blue throat and by that time the gang leader's right	hand was on the butt of his revolver.	5.103383774804796
14897. i'm billy tilghman	said the stranger and i've come for pat conyers' body.	4.0683852436856025
14898. and what makes you think you're going to get it pretty	boy?	7.984235967288568
14899.    because i'm asking.	9.533273138783178
14900. most of the time i get	what i ask for.	9.268041150222498
14901. blue throat winked at his six cronies.	5.241506333428034
14902. the kid has no manners boys.	6.341368371735744
14903. shall we teach him some?	5.7205101898092
14904.  his	gun was half drawn when he asked the question but the weapon never	left its holster.	5.5132830605435545
14905. tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific	right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin.	3.9724913621025757
14906. his	head snapped round and he reeled back crashing into the table where	his buddies were sprawling.	5.2288514545018705
14907. tilghman leapt on to him dragged	him upright and hit him again this time sending him careening against	the bar.	3.83105115046776
14908. a bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from tilghman's	stomach as blue throat's henchmen started shooting.	5.024392545371498
14909. tilghman	flung himself aside dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun.	4.0683852436856025
14910. the colt roared twice and two men dropped writhing.	5.5298765977228985
14911. a third shot	doused the light.	6.337177714080869
14912. somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled	you all right billy?	7.287646431525132
14913.    yes george but i ain't	got poor old pat's body yet.	4.8609413734437386
14914. and i aim to have it.	8.885930461707039
14915. he fired	again and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed.	4.85913601384685
14916. another took off	his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor.	5.958275550566003
14917. and me said another blue throat	henchman.	5.662844612144823
14918. tilghman and his partner	george rust herded the men into a corner.	5.947501206670346
14919. and now said tilghman	with deadly calm i'll repeat what i said.	4.851614523533367
14920. i've come	for pat conyers' body.	7.712079578137997
14921. in two minutes the body of tilghman's	former comrade who had been killed by blue throat in a gambling	brawl the previous night was carried into the town's funeral	parlor to be prepared for decent burial.	3.8716972701912438
14922. blue throat nursing an aching	jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride rode out of town with the	survivors of the fight.	5.275373824300345
14923. that critter will be back tomorrow	predicted george rust and he'll bring fifty of his kind	back with him.	3.9740257225120184
14924. blue throat won't stand for this.	7.690590034245127
14925. he'll shoot up	the town.	6.162967476035402
14926. the reverend james	doran had scarcely completed pat conyers' last rites on boot	hill in the township of petrie when shots were heard in the distance.	4.426391855976781
14927. amen said the reverend doran grabbing his rifle propped	up against a tombstone and now my brethren it would seem that	our presence is required elsewhere.	3.5382376858249054
14928. billy tilghman and	his comrades rode off to the battle.	6.479267522112899
14929. blue throat who had ruled the	town with his six-shooter for the last six months certainly had no intention	of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship.	3.831235414518723
14930. it was essential	that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring	ruthless gun-slinger and this was the time-honored wild west method	of doing it.	5.913333697504567
14931. he rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and	liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance	to main street.	4.023808166177389
14932. the entire length of the street could be raked with	rifle fire from this barn.	5.758008689123866
14933. any posse riding down the street to demand	blue throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst	of fire.	3.9007857203904504
14934. the law-abiding citizens of petrie had gathered	inside kaster's store halfway down the street.	5.147325127162375
14935. several were firing	into the barn when billy tilghman arrived.	5.078509422894933
14936. he sized up the situation	and shook his head.	6.672854314451728
14937. if blue throat has his way he'll	keep us all cooped up in here for days he said.	3.957269339965862
14938. there's only	one thing to move him fast and we have it right here in this very	store.	5.855414419951481
14939. he called the store owner and together they went into	the stockroom.	4.864986841117586
14940. billy returned with six sticks of dynamite.	6.817628764983669
14941. i'm	gonna drop these into blue throat's lap he announced and	i'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while i get near	enough to toss 'em through the window.	3.2847726970144535
14942. he slipped outside	hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways.	6.0713971930250175
14943. blue throat's	men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts	and board walk as he passed.	3.751933998561409
14944. fifty yards away from the barn	he dodged inside a barber's shop and came out at the back.	6.078378309642025
14945. here he	couldn't be seen by blue throat and his gang.	4.9647315979738424
14946. all he had to do	was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks run to within ten yards of	an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through.	5.21282224092092
14947. billy	tilghman did just that.	6.162967476035402
14948. within seconds the big barn was blasted into	smoking splinters with every outlaw either dead or injured inside.	5.5193412730918485
14949. it was the abrupt end of blue throat's dictatorship in petrie.	5.08586778774972
14950. though	only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to	those parts.	5.739974350684024
14951. to tilghman the incident was just one of a long	list of hair-raising smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the	law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old and did	not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning	a drunk to be quiet.	3.929754707050104
14952. of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys	of the old west uncle billy tilghman stands out head and	shoulders.	6.161826722735497
14953. he was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any	other famous gun-slinging character in the book.	4.613680370086201
14954. he saw the most action	beat up more badmen with his bare fists broke up the most gangs and	sent more murderers to the gallows than any other us marshal	who lived before or after him.	5.077118383120446
14955. for fifty years his guns and	ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the	enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the west.	3.598483166078083
14956. the deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified	almost to the point of hero-worship but because billy tilghman remained	strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career	his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the	west have remained almost unsung.	4.970251752982789
14957. citizens took the view that	a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway	but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of	half a century.	3.796871841330248
14958. he came within an ace of being riddled with bullets	during his long fight with the doolin gang which terrorized oklahoma	in the 1890's.	5.047499402894438
14959. led by bill doolin these mobsters specialized	in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed	banks making liberal use of their guns.	3.623260290214867
14960. bill doolin's ambition	it appeared was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of	jesse james and billy the kid and bill tilghman had sworn he would	stop him.	4.712408203572073
14961. tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove	with the doolin gang.	4.317068102383446
14962. they bought rustled cattle from the outlaw	kept him supplied with guns and ammunition harbored his men in their	houses.	5.175531359394042
14963. billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers	named ed dunn who lived at rock fort.	4.213896581457938
14964. on a bitterly	cold day in january 1895 accompanied only by neal brown as his	deputy tilghman left the township of guthrie and headed for rock fort	and dunn's ranch.	4.990153131642909
14965. it was snowing hard when they got there and	they saw no horses outside.	4.330418767322374
14966. the only evidence of occupation came from	the chimney which was belching out thick smoke.	5.592240617897265
14967. the two lawmen	halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door.	4.225139639097082
14968. wait here	neal said tilghman.	8.457718703298294
14969. if i don't come out within half an	hour ride back to town and bring out a posse.	4.138828058658517
14970. leaving his rifle	in the wagon tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it.	6.121667917681991
14971. there was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside.	4.522887474470208
14972. directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire a welcome sight	on that bitterly cold day.	5.590758797203668
14973. seated near it with his back to the door	was the rancher ed dunn.	4.533249994893844
14974. the rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didn't move.	5.815222439716939
14975. tilghman	closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire.	4.317068102383446
14976. suddenly	he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch	and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck.	5.256974512648689
14977. along each side	of the room were six tiered bunks each one screened off with a curtain.	4.13205313324256
14978. and projecting wickedly through these curtains were the	gleaming muzzles of six rifles all trained on billy tilghman.	5.257678151855728
14979. the	fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs	might slam into his hide.	3.8182363423513666
14980. thinking fast tilghman never	hesitated for one instant.	6.743273855772659
14981. he walked right up to the fire as though blissfully	unaware of the guns covering him.	4.501189348052495
14982. the men behind them were	bill doolin and five of his gang- every man a killer.	5.322953053044211
14983. cold	day said tilghman placing his hands behind him and casually	presenting his backside to the fire.	3.8101576301595865
14984. just dropped in to ask where	jed hawkins lives.	7.487897783286921
14985. can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow.	4.908280300811694
14986. he wouldn't look tilghman in	the face.	7.5139871259533155
14987. follow the river for five miles he said hoarsely.	4.993468208002531
14988. jed's	homestead is on the south bank.	9.261911942739593
14989. resisting the overwhelming	temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap	tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation	for a good ten minutes.	3.5844855076371247
14990. all that time rifle barrels were pointing	unwaveringly at his head and body.	6.481825543342247
14991. one false move on his part and	he would be a dead man.	5.061179431206364
14992. well he announced guess i'll	be going now ed and thanks for the warmup.	6.061850998728884
14993. he strolled back	to the door whistling softly hands still clasped behind him.	4.191792515969988
14994. he	left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace	and wondered by what remarkable stroke of providence he had been	allowed to come out alive.	4.930037586281194
14995. but he knew well enough that those	guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon.	4.159294009001257
14996. if he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his	deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly.	5.675403652907337
14997. leisurely	he climbed on to the wagon next to neal brown.	4.858138433292986
14998. don't say or	do anything he said softly.	6.743273855772659
14999. just get out of here without it looking	as though we're in a hurry.	4.757427682881709
15000. that place is crawling with bill	doolin and his gang.	6.940935020433001
15001. even as he spoke those words billy	tilghman's life hung on a thread.	4.5401881270073146
15002. back in the house a hoodlum named	red buck sore because billy had been allowed to leave unscathed	jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right	then.	5.3556046493579395
15003. you'll stay right here commanded bill doolin	covering red with his rifle.	4.182602481535312
15004. billy tilghman is too good a man	to shoot in the back.	5.786320559633637
15005. but the fighting	marshal's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a	full and final stop one night in a street at cromwell oklahoma where	he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets.	3.445838602103445
15006. wiley lynn a self-styled prohibition officer had hit town the previous	day and had been drinking ever since.	5.184341049429939
15007. that night he reeled out	of ma murphy's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting	off his revolver.	3.8408975680933235
15008. for several months now jack carter a big overgrown boy of fifteen	with a fuzzy pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot	of red in them had been haunted by a dream a vision of a woman.	4.553528086330586
15009. this	woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face but she	radiated warmth a sweet warmth; she would talk to him in a soothing	voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put	her hands on him and kiss him passionately.	3.261785450493884
15010. when she would do these	things he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach.	5.771185302875259
15011. then he would run to the toilet behind the house.	5.339578928847046
15012. sometimes he	did this three or four times a day for this woman was almost always	with him.	6.463999757204395
15013. he would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother	and father knew- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell	it on him.	3.853417013235738
15014. but they never said anything so he figured it was all right.	6.696243320004731
15015. and so when miss langford came to teach at the one-room	chestnut school where jack was a pupil in the eighth grade the woman	of jack's mind assumed the teacher's face and figure.	3.553599148426331
15016. he could	not keep his eyes off her when at school; when he went home at	night he took her with him in his mind and she did the things the anonymous	woman used to do and he did the thing afterwards each time as	he used to do.	4.535990866829535
15017. when he awoke in the mornings she was in his mind and	he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh.	4.321017927713262
15018. miss langford was an attractive	girl.	9.046288316196136
15019. tall blonde blue-eyes fair buxom without being heavy she cut	a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils	in her fresh starched summer dress.	3.3515864650355898
15020. something was beginning to stir	and come alive in her too	she was twenty now; but if it had been it had been smothered until	: you could tell it by the way she watched the older	bigger boys like jack.	5.737490304363792
15021. she would look at jack with that hidden	something in her eyes and jack would see the woman and become breathless	and a little sick.	3.698851661056512
15022. school began in august the hottest	part of the year and for the first few days miss langford was very	lenient with the children letting them play a lot and the new ones sort	of get acquainted with one another.	5.671095170539558
15023. the first two or three days they	went home early.	6.16899931657767
15024. all that is except jack.	10.835842431828048
15025. he hung around	the schoolhouse watching through a window from outside while miss	langford straightened desks and put the room in order.	3.6136931595464405
15026. once	she kneeled down to pick up some books	where they'd dropped on the floor and jack looked up her dress-	at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg.	5.209227137556302
15027. he thought for a moment	his heart had stopped beating.	4.640827628988695
15028. about that time miss langford straightened	up and looked out the window directly at him he thought although	probably she didn't even see him.	5.335492139239215
15029. he jumped back ducked and ran	crouching down the hill away from the school.	4.783149018196766
15030. he didn't	look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and	out of breath; then he slowed to a walk.	5.604770153025382
15031. the vision became even stronger	now.	4.960658741533125
15032. i'll get her yet	he muttered to himself.	6.743273855772659
15033. i've got to get her.	5.984636472844131
15034. that night he dreamed	a dream violent with passion in which he and the woman now the	teacher did everything except engage in the act	and when he	awoke the next morning his heart was afire.	4.9976219778439654
15035. he ate litle that	morning and his mother became concerned inasmuch as he usually ate	heartily.	3.9894859797279003
15036. what's the matter honey?	8.457718703298294
15037.  she said with the	solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child.	4.70196720721318
15038. aren't	you hungry?	11.155741451300253
15039.    no i'm not hungry he said pushing	back the bacon and eggs.	4.584901709342695
15040. outside it was already hot at 7:30 am	and it was getting hot in the kitchen.	5.864956180280772
15041. he felt a little sick at	his stomach.	6.090817552546156
15042. are you sick?	13.1608144470119
15043.    no he said.	8.698878600707348
15044. i guess it's this hot weather.	7.95751090267089
15045. don't you play hard today then.	5.219666477665999
15046. and if you get sick ask the teacher	to let you come home early.	6.687479962120035
15047. daddy left the car for me and i'm	going to town this afternoon.	4.160043742607753
15048. o k i won't	play hard he promised.	8.12393638739842
15049. just then charles lever yelled hey	jack from the quarry road which ran behind the carter house	and jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen	door yelling good-bye mom over his shoulder.	3.4418761696814184
15050. whaddya	say boy?	11.155741451300253
15051.  charles said grinning showing his huge yellow	teeth.	5.228464372441686
15052. charles also fifteen was tall and skinny scraggly with	straight black hair like an indian's and sharp brown eyes.	5.14253871571804
15053. he considered	himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him.	4.083443138568456
15054. you know what i done last night?	9.211110442771112
15055.  charles said as	they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away	from the dixie highway through a corn field and a patch of woods to	the school.	3.495825548896892
15056. jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded	would involve a girl and probably be dirty because girls were charles'	only apparent interest.	5.201476534905337
15057. but jack always derived vicarious sensual	thrills from charles' revelations	so he usually invited them as he	did now.	3.9238037088949635
15058. what?	13.921774766768346
15059.    i got margaret rider in one	of them old box cars down there by the quarry.	4.025949360474192
15060. a nude imaginary	picture of miss langford flashed across jack's mind.	5.866330554951393
15061. hell you say?	6.939425769494729
15062.  he said lapsing into the profanity	he often used when away from his parents and especially when he	was with charles.	5.598662981702478
15063. how'd you do it?	6.162967476035402
15064.    hell i jist	got on top of-   no i mean how'd you get her to	do it?	5.2288514545018705
15065.    hell i jist ask her.	5.619635421798327
15066. jist like	that?	11.155741451300253
15067.    hell yes.	8.12896173865557
15068. she's been hangin' around me	a lot here lately and i figgered i might as well's try it.	5.096784851710171
15069. besides	i heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin' it.	4.616524067950736
15070. it's all over branchville.	8.776825984330314
15071. if you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even	get her your ownself.	4.351915492802778
15072. i might try it one of these days	jack said wonderingly thinking of miss langford.	6.285642992232586
15073. when	they reached the school a gang of boys and girls were already	there playing crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse.	4.122643325117625
15074. miss	langford in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals without	socks was out there with them trying to get them inside.	5.1252593637409465
15075. time	for books she yelled jingling a little five-and-dime store	bell in her right hand.	3.9701983041559052
15076. oh come	on miss langford play with us just onct one of the little girls	begged smiling wistfully.	6.790699686638365
15077. no not now said the teacher.	5.9905667560537506
15078. come inside now.	9.792522136379244
15079. the children	grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse.	3.873635296338494
15080. jack watched miss langford all morning.	7.257069204181146
15081. he could think of nothing	else save his mental image of her nude figure and what charles	had said that morning about margaret rider.	3.82923815605447
15082. occasionally he would	look across the aisle at margaret fourteen and demure in a fresh green	organdy dress sitting in the sixth-grade row and he coud hardly believe	she would do what charles had said she did.	4.548892763938813
15083. at noontime	remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the	kids jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys	except charles went off out the road to play ball.	3.792015084393897
15084. why ain't	you playin' ball?	10.570105961395418
15085.  he asked charles suspiciously as they sat	in the well-house shade watching the girls congregate in front of the	schoolhouse.	4.455947510478123
15086. miss langford come out and play with us like you	promised several of the little girls called.	6.5552933852522015
15087. i'd druther	stay here and watch the girls charles grinned.	4.642993050468348
15088. maybe some	of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress.	6.113545766112348
15089. maybe	jack said idly watching for miss langford.	4.913686410369733
15090. presently	she came out of the schoolhouse.	9.97423862841989
15091. when she appeared two or three	of the little girls jumped up and down yelling goody goody.	4.5994110732921465
15092. let's play with 'em jack said rising from where	he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants.	5.534397043033375
15093. ok	charles rose also and the two of them moved over to join	the girls.	4.552882591324834
15094. they played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap.	7.058360711188566
15095. then when miss langford was on the end of the line of girls	jack in the middle of the line gave an extra hard pull and the young	teacher sprawled backwards sitting down hard her dress flying over	her head.	4.279829193972151
15096. while she was struggling to get her skirt down and get	on her feet again jack ran over offered her his hand and said gosh	i'm sorry miss langford.	4.910116050578908
15097. i didn't mean to pull so hard.	5.406629921006237
15098. that's all right she said tossing her head back	to get the hair out of her eyes.	5.138210239895059
15099. with one hand	she held her skirt down while she took jack's extended hand with	the other.	4.263873477400964
15100. when her hand touched his fire went through jack and he	felt weak but he managed somehow to get her on her feet.	5.159941128075454
15101. he thought	she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand	go.	3.770206449411329
15102. thank you she said dusting herself off.	7.5302692482413525
15103. will you play with us again miss langford?	5.509470297653876
15104.  one of the little	girls said.	10.208519814576752
15105. maybe some other day.	7.389334871335298
15106. oh shucks the girl said.	8.887941185542141
15107. i don't believe i'll	play any more neither.	5.541592562971775
15108. me neither others said and soon	the game broke up the children going off in pairs in larger groups	and alone.	5.166603279601124
15109. jack walked off alone out the road in the searing	midday sun past robert allen's three-room tarpapered house toward	the field where the other boys were playing ball thinking of what	he would do in order to make miss langford have him stay in after	school- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw	the look in her eyes.	3.2740184902986758
15110. when he came back to the schoolhouse	his mind was made up.	8.73563033165622
15111. he simply would not work his arithmetic problems	when the teacher held his class.	4.083443138568456
15112. that should do it he thought because	miss langford had said she was going to be strict about school	work.	6.292830299490893
15113. he had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone	or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him but he	couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities: the teacher	probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay	in after school.	3.543507005830834
15114. the only drawback now to the plan he'd	decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work too and the	teacher would have that person stay late along with jack.	4.6733036385400855
15115. but	i've got to take a chance on it he told himself desperately.	4.617290742633957
15116. to his surprise his plan worked perfectly.	7.7768354006718665
15117. all right if you	can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school	it out miss langford said firmly not smiling.	3.931797864002356
15118. you will	stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and	work your problems.	6.224386318217
15119. and so when the others stampeded out that	afternoon	jack remained docilely in his seat near a window looking out in	what he hoped was a pitiable manner while the other kids laughed and	yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed going home.	3.3441103871976794
15120. his heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was	trying to think his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened	child how will i do it?	4.549131524408634
15121. 	on the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a	young woman of remarkable beauty and poise.	3.632711015013689
15122. she munched little ginger	cakes called mulatto's belly and kept her green somewhat hypnotic	eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot	king snake wrapped around his bronze neck.	4.676841333975465
15123. the youth with	the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman.	3.837501740732655
15124. lithe and muscular he had well-molded features and his light	color told of the european ancestors who had been intimate with the slave	women of his family.	5.122470763366199
15125. the haughty white girl turned to a distinguished	hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured: look	at your watch col garvier.	3.3253845082477778
15126. it is almost time for and calinda	to begin.	7.676080989625772
15127. col henri garvier was one of new orleans'	most important and enlightened slave owners.	4.584750056669895
15128. he chuckled and gave	the signal for the dance to start.	6.385554112606288
15129. the slaves ran gaily to the center	of congo square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called johnny	no-name.	3.5609732436556962
15130. johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer	bones against the gourd which served as his drum.	5.526592267835835
15131. he showed his gleaming	tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently his brass earrings jangling	discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy.	3.7117997545722354
15132. the	drummer	flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda	a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners	and their disciples in the louisiana slave compounds.	4.612138714008325
15133. the	dance was of haitian origin.	5.619635421798327
15134. the white girl with the penetrating	green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of	about 30 who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows.	4.615018738266286
15135. he was possessive	in his manner and though a slave obviously was educated after a	fashion and imitated the manners of his owners.	3.7559938355334124
15136. he proudly wore the	blue livery of her house for the girl was madame delphine lalaurie	wife of the prominent surgeon dr louis lalaurie who bore one	of the south's oldest and most cherished names.	4.580639761374837
15137. delphine was	a pace-setter in high society.	5.219666477665999
15138. she was a top horsewoman and one of	the city's most gracious hostesses.	6.977739567555777
15139. although new orleans was not	to learn of it for a spell she also was a sadist a nymphomaniac and	unobtrusively mad- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against	humanity ever committed on american soil.	3.9956624253099484
15140. madame lalaurie	gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was	stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders.	4.833408899516839
15141. the slender handsome fellow was called dandy brandon by	the other slaves.	3.7801503613451746
15142. he was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure	for women of any race.	5.8727012955973885
15143. but dandy had had little experience with	girls on his master's plantation in bayou st john.	4.002885994024083
15144. shy	actually he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant	of the girls' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in	the open fields in carriages and in boathouses.	4.609159306614517
15145. this young slave	was therefore quite unprepared when delphine lalaurie signaled	that she wanted him to draw near.	3.80965061478659
15146. the woman eyed the youth with the	avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is	not yet in his collection.	4.489091446524395
15147. what is your name boy?	7.89254783685251
15148.  come	a bit closer.	9.52328749892442
15149. i won't bite you know.	6.316170410054584
15150. he gaped at madame	lalaurie and sniffed the paris perfume which emanated from her.	5.603893504423084
15151. my name is dandy brandon missy.	6.572105015393532
15152. i belong	to master alexander prieur.	8.667966011188964
15153. she said with intense feeling:	come near let me feel your arms.	4.880840525902208
15154. you look quite strong and	healthy to me dandy.	7.684509780742778
15155. mrs lalaurie impatiently propelled	the slave toward her waiting carriage.	4.881027605220258
15156. lifting her skirts she climbed	in never relinquishing her grip on his arm.	5.583228874976599
15157. the woman seemed utterly	unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor.	3.868537167467065
15158. once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau she drew the curtains	and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination	usually reserved for army inductees.	5.752913304457573
15159. satisfied at last and	after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced delphine that	dandy was capable of learning new arts she opened the window and called	to her liveried driver.	3.2653762695140407
15160. this was the big man with the proprietory	air and the beetling shaggy eyebrows.	7.113370113245217
15161. aristide! i	want you	to find monsieur prieur at once and give him this money for the	boy's purchase.	3.935732504159285
15162. there's $600 in gold in this chamois sack.	6.412214371980113
15163. if the	old fool argues about the price tell him i shall order my husband	not to treat him as a patient any longer.	3.901874540459559
15164. prieur has gout and depends	on louis' pills and bleedings.	6.144814417540349
15165. besides he owns 300 slaves.	6.656530492491094
15166. one	less shouldn't matter to him.	7.712079578137997
15167. aristide devol the sardonic	manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native	sierra leone smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver	hat.	3.7291170775711775
15168. his bold eyes raked the woman and a perceptive spectator might	sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to	owner.	5.438696713652174
15169. another youth madame?	8.051207622828299
15170.  the coachman said softly.	6.996493558081793
15171. this one is a tender chicken oui?	5.324161665177116
15172.  such delicate beauty	such fine flesh.	9.286054480295212
15173. it will rip and shred easily for madame.	5.8453742508198685
15174. be quiet devol! you are forgetting your place.	7.693486709838886
15175. the	tall coachman walked off briskly in search of alexander prieur.	4.683171625590857
15176. delphine	lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove dandy	brandon- cowering in the back seat of the carriage- to her mansion	at 677 perdido street.	5.070054394411346
15177. dr louis lalaurie stood on the	veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached	the pillared mansion.	4.236321200215536
15178. dandy curiosity overcoming his apprehensions	peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle.	5.712354370549471
15179. he	saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large	head.	4.3581847145216335
15180. dr lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket and his myopic	eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses.	5.3538218231622725
15181. he was	about 50 years old.	5.926245264679889
15182. another young man my dear?	8.656998239068969
15183.  really	you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself he said frowning	with displeasure.	3.9701983041559052
15184. delphine presented her cheek for a kiss	and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster.	5.2288514545018705
15185. dandy is	to be our house guest louis.	4.913686410369733
15186. i want the room in the attic prepared	for him he is a most unusual lad quite precocious in many ways.	6.004110819355204
15187. he	deserves a better life than just rotting away on the prieur plantation.	4.0683852436856025
15188. his room will be ready shortly.	7.540633229048254
15189. the physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory	glance at the cringing slave.	3.5177069743400518
15190. had dandy been older or wiser instinct	might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the	lalauries' tender care if he valued his life.	5.496491832418289
15191. but he liked	the smell of delphine's perfume.	6.083102455604713
15192. besides her endearments and caresses	in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple	youth.	5.488686745719059
15193. also he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony.	4.9540428041642395
15194. so dandy brandon trustingly entered the house with delphine	lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to	be his new home.	4.9942594119330295
15195. airless and dingy though it was the attic represented	luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and	sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at bayou st john.	3.504995842880062
15196. he bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted	when madame lalaurie- after closing the door- showed the	slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber.	4.6810449074923755
15197. it was just as well that the ignorant dandy enjoyed himself to the	hilt that first evening for the room was to become his prison cell.	3.633345452528356
15198. when he finally left the sinister mansion on perdido street he was	carried out in a coroner's basket.	5.905416571844617
15199. just six weeks after	dandy brandon's arrival at the mansion the little surgeon and	his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball to which	only new orleans' oldest and wealthiest families were invited.	3.3798311547862165
15200. a stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms and delphine	circulated graciously among her guests chatting airily of the	forthcoming races the latest fashions from paris and louisiana	politics.	4.613440771582235
15201. suddenly there was a commotion upstairs a despairing	boyish shriek and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians	and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase.	3.6786958970460346
15202. it was dandy brandon clad only in a bloody loincloth	emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him.	5.5210407384502815
15203. the	lad's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts.	4.182602481535312
15204. his pinched	face showed the ravages of malnutrition.	7.065535338067961
15205. feebly he pointed an	accusing finger at madame lalaurie and shouted: evil woman!	you did this h you like to hurt h to beat people h i want h	to go home.	3.4332359347788994
15206. these were the last words he ever uttered.	7.455354403795766
15207. convulsively	he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of senator	gaston berche crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician	wore.	3.5033994744337345
15208. dr louis lalaurie examined the inert form of	the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead.	5.3538218231622725
15209. the ball	broke up in confusion.	4.747750369463677
15210. guests stared with horror at madame lalaurie	and made speedy departures.	6.356757916740278
15211. delphine stood like stone	her eyes alive	with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse.	4.128327570881345
15212. but at	the coroner's inquest delphine told a forthright story.	6.60434795749222
15213. i	saw the boy dandy at the congo square festivities and felt sorry	for him.	3.9701983041559052
15214. it was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom	when the right time came for he was a bright and friendly youth who	seemed worthy of our interest.	5.299792287935255
15215. after i paid monsieur prieur for	dandy i brought him home but he was ill at ease and ran away the	same night.	4.126163002218012
15216. how he returned in such a ghastly condition or why i	cannot say.	7.050576811193146
15217. dr lalaurie and i didn't even know he was in the	house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs.	4.196054565012552
15218. she daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said	with obvious emotion: that poor boy! he must have fallen in	with evil companions for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and	inexperienced.	5.027558062715782
15219. ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing	him back to our house to die.	3.916009021555999
15220. such a pitiful end!   though	the slave's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner's	panel dandy's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury	and disregarded.	5.085323365693834
15221. the lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder	and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the veracity	of so illustrious a lady.	3.7070569926960637
15222. moreover runaway slaves frequently got into	serious trouble in new orleans' dives.	6.445448044953259
15223. so the verict was	death at the hands of a person or persons unknown and the elite	of the city accepting delphine's testimony welcomed her and the	doctor back into the fold.	4.012386878578554
15224. once again life went its serene way- soirees	fox hunts balls and dinners.	6.516475162253429
15225. the excitement over brandon's	bizarre death abated and madame lalaurie's stock soared when	she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing	cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital.	3.237927993784169
15226. then	on july 2 there occurred another incident which set tongues to	wagging at a furious clip.	5.2288514545018705
15227. mrs victor dominique socially	prominent and a neighbor of the lalauries chanced to glance out of	her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight.	3.479249962199219
15228. the	manservant devol and his mistress delphine lalaurie were pursuing	a young girl- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty- across the front	lawn of the lalaurie mansion.	4.714137561967006
15229. the girl was not more than 16.	4.767563348397103
15230. she	was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not	conceal the knife slashes on her back.	4.874506940189859
15231. the bleeding girl was	tiring fast; the coachman and delphine were gaining on her as she raced	down perdido street.	3.471086609958486
15232. the fugitive cried out in an oddly	sibilant voice: help me somebody! they have pulled out all	my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw!	bastards he would say all i did was put a beat to that vivaldi	stuff and the first chair clobbered me! since then and	since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent- and	even indecent- group from greenwich village to the embarcadero	he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper.	4.045316373647057
15233. there ain't	nothin' faster or lonelier or more direct than a cannonball	freight	when you wanna go someplace feathertop would say.	4.0599694543878115
15234. the accommodations	may not be the poshest but man! there ain't nobody	askin' for your	ticket stub neither.	4.971665001675533
15235. he had been conning	the freights for a long long time now.	5.993692004453004
15236. ever since the hooch and the	trouble with the quartet and midge and the child.	6.039004546322354
15237. it had been a very long time that had no form and no end.	5.7797712096133065
15238. he was- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer	his own- riding the dark train out.	5.494955862805713
15239. out and out and never to return	again.	5.8694355274283225
15240. till one day the last freight had been jumped the last pint	had been killed the last beat had been rapped.	5.047834407331075
15241. that was the day it	ended.	8.86409247277792
15242. the freight car was cold early in the morning.	6.287800554994817
15243. he was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks	the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering	the sound of his ocarina.	4.024251610687721
15244. he held his elbows away from his	body and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled	its tune-belly.	4.99190498003522
15245. the train slowed at a road crossing and	the big door slid open; at first gratingly caught by grains of corn-	then with a clash into its slot.	3.1862044341510183
15246. the boy lifted the girl	by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor.	5.247429814923464
15247. she pulled her legs	up under her to rise her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs and	feathertop's music pffft-ed away.	3.7164846586411535
15248. now that is a very nice	a very nice he murmured to himself back in his corner.	6.674582160790387
15249. a	little thing but the right twist for the action that counted.	4.508771361283492
15250. hot	that was the word hot! hair like a morning-frightened sparrow's	wings with the sun shining down over them.	5.057556181613073
15251. a poet yet! his thoughts	for the swanlike neck the full high breasts the slim waist and	the long legs were less than poetic however.	3.41756403073522
15252. zingggg-o!	then the boy straight-armed himself up twisting at the last	moment so he landed sitting.	5.331440467598945
15253. he was less to see but feathertop	took him in too just to keep the records straight.	4.434127599096672
15254. curly	hair high cheekbones wide gnomelike mouth a pair of drummer's	blocky hands and a body that said well maybe i can wrestle you for	ten minutes- but then i'm finished.	4.808261253491304
15255. we made it cappy	the chick said.	5.905279144285114
15256. yeah seems so don't it the boy	laughed hugging her close.	5.9245075971793435
15257. ah-ah! feathertop interrupted	standing up brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants.	4.0683852436856025
15258. we run a respectable house here.	8.24845442738875
15259. they whirled	and saw him standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded	freight wall.	3.9789745378525514
15260. he was big and filthy and his toes stuck out of	the flapping tops of his shoes.	5.605390629947532
15261. he held the black plastic kazoo lightly.	5.13143041193367
15262. come sit said feathertop motioning them toward	him.	6.863974732831304
15263. that crap is softer over here.	6.115397952348643
15264. the girl smiled and	started forward.	6.5153514259002465
15265. the boy yanked her back hard tugging her off her	feet and gathered her into the crook of his arm.	3.427262089751677
15266. now stay	with me kitty he snapped irritably.	7.682276602515661
15267. i vowed to take care of	you- and that's what i'm gonna do.	4.456974736844467
15268. we don't know this guy.	8.845542587831394
15269. oooo square bit feathertop screwed his face up.	4.6724501027054846
15270. this	guy was strictly from outsville.	7.712079578137997
15271. but nowhere!   what	is with this vow jazz?	5.350857324489514
15272.  feathertop inquired lounging against	the freight's vibrating wall.	6.743273855772659
15273. we- we eloped cappy	said.	6.162967476035402
15274. his head came up and he said it defiantly.	8.007495816532087
15275. feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand.	4.6724501027054846
15276. these two were going to be easy pickins.	9.916306457796829
15277. they couldn't have much	dough but then none of the freight-bums feathertop rolled had	much.	4.810188117070911
15278. and besides the chick had a little something the others didn't	have.	6.309796185523824
15279. that was gonna be fun collecting!   but not just	yet.	5.507102022156478
15280. he liked to savor his meat before	he tasted it.	6.954644589198113
15281. come sit he repeated motioning to the piled	hay bags over the pig leavings.	4.01603703623319
15282. i'm just a poor ex-jazz man name	of- uh- boyd smith.	5.9245075971793435
15283. he grinned at them wolfishly.	5.926245264679889
15284. that ain't your name mister the boy accused.	7.316886888979397
15285. and	you know- you're right! feathertop aimed a finger at	him.	4.477601198394805
15286. oh come on cappy the girl chided.	7.573472848649923
15287. she started to move toward the hay bags	dragging the reluctant cappy behind her.	4.387440266992004
15288. feathertop watched	the smooth scissoring of her slim trim legs as she walked to the bags	and tucked them beneath her smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle.	4.8161051420223995
15289. he cleared his throat; it had been a long hot while since he'd	seen anything as nice as this within grabbin' distance.	4.12429774376594
15290. he had it all doped of course.	8.15916208805256
15291. slug the kid grab his dough- at least	enough to get to philadelphia- and then have a rockin' ball	with the doll.	3.8224014724671207
15292. hmm- diddle!   where'd you come from	mr- uh- mr smith?	6.144814417540349
15293.  kitty inquired politely.	6.939425769494729
15294. out.	13.921774766768346
15295. i been riding train for a ways	now.	5.404220572333583
15296. they lapsed into silence and the freight wallowed up	a hill scooted down the other side shaking and clanking to itself.	5.534970876000369
15297. after a while kitty murmured something to cappy and he held	her close answering we'll just have to wait till we pull into	philly honey.	3.896144284748759
15298. what's the matter she wanna go the	bathroom?	6.855295838522673
15299.  ernie found it immensely funny.	5.619635421798327
15300. the boy scowled	at him and the girl looked shocked.	6.437396226730266
15301. no! certainly not	i mean no that isn't what i said! she snapped at him.	3.8849121559715263
15302. i only said i was hungry.	7.95751090267089
15303. we haven't had anything to eat all	day.	5.497086847134583
15304. joviality suffused feathertop ernie cargill's voice	as he reached behind him pulling out a battered carpet bag with	leather handles.	4.985333447698777
15305. whyn't ya say so fellow travelers! why we	got dinner right here.	4.182602481535312
15306. c'mon buddy help me set up the kitchen and	we'll have food in a minute or two.	5.282349501937775
15307. cappy looked wary	but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to	the center of the refuse-littered boxcar.	3.992251540370782
15308. ernie crouched and	opened the carpet bag.	7.163184125958424
15309. he took out a small packet filled with bits of	charcoal a deep pot of thin metal some sheets of newspaper a book	of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with	holes in it.	3.3268336470270667
15310. he put the charcoal in the pot lit the paper with the	matches and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot.	5.509219601100998
15311. a charcoal pit man he said indicating the	slightly-smoking	makeshift brazier.	4.43026810195405
15312. fan it he told cappy handing him	a sheet of newspaper.	6.147568265192723
15313. yeah but what're we gonna eat?	5.219666477665999
15314. 	charcoal?	13.921774766768346
15315.    fella ernie waggled a dirty finger at	the younger man you try my ever-lovin' patience.	3.8849121559715263
15316. he reached	once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners.	5.47495185046749
15317. not the greatest but they stick to your belly	insides.	5.4876727499228695
15318. he ripped down the cellophane carefully and laid	three dogs on the tin foil.	5.603893504423084
15319. almost immediately they began to sizzle.	6.426109312388901
15320. he looked up and grinned.	8.131809156890613
15321. a kroger's self-serve he	explained.	6.0574501475319265
15322. when they had licked the	last of the wieners' taste from their fingers they settled back	and cappy offered ernie a cigarette.	5.69259570439505
15323. nice kid ernie thought	too bad.	6.055833859993128
15324. how come you're riding the rods kids like you?	7.010782183353787
15325. 	ernie asked.	8.12896173865557
15326. cappy looked down at his wide hands and	did not reply.	6.140831460022497
15327. but surprisingly kitty's face came up and she said	my father.	4.616074914120093
15328. he didn't want us to get married.	7.414947361841397
15329. why didn't he want you to get hitched?	6.236251347821695
15330. 	this time even she did not answer.	7.0889705689754745
15331. she looked down at her hands too.	5.71180454009465
15332. after a few seconds she said dad didn't like cappy.	7.725991636941674
15333. cappy's head came around sharply.	5.619635421798327
15334. your fault	hell! it was all my fault.	8.012508115196894
15335. if i'd been careful it never woulda-	he stopped abruptly.	5.023313515610302
15336. what's	the matter?	11.155741451300253
15337.    the girl still did not raise her	eyes but she added simply i'm pregnant.	3.631127011658667
15338. oh he was stupid her old man! you never heard nothin'	like it: kitty's gonna go have an abortion and kitty's	gonna go away to a convent and kitty's this and kitty's that h	like he was nuts or somethin' y'know?	4.450773860019503
15339.    ernie nodded.	8.12896173865557
15340. this was a slightly different matter.	9.899551923469579
15341. he remembered midge and the	child.	5.926245264679889
15342. but that had been a time before all this a time he didn't	think about.	7.213690109283046
15343. a time before the white lightning and the bumming had	turned him inside out.	3.9371227553405066
15344. but these kids weren't like him.	8.866590983894334
15345. oh	crap! he thought pull out of it old son.	5.545106224273249
15346. these are just another	couple of characters to roll.	7.6045330780436515
15347. what they got you get.	7.3575260821053465
15348. now forget	all this other.	10.11823024516735
15349. wanna drink?	8.12896173865557
15350.  ernie offered taking	the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket.	5.739974350684024
15351. the answer came from the open door of the boxcar.	5.005517258548323
15352. from the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside as the train	had slowed on the grade.	6.484131697320059
15353. ernie stared at the man.	5.619635421798327
15354. real big with shoulders out to here and hair all over him like	a grizzly.	5.331440467598945
15355. you gonna give	me a drink fella?	6.490824436842797
15356.  the big man asked again taking a step into the	boxcar.	5.855580938376051
15357. this character could break	him in half.	5.404008596237766
15358. sure he said and lifted the pint to his own lips.	7.058148043589683
15359. he guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered	the remainder.	4.318068015596563
15360. the man stalked toward them his big boots heavy	on the wooden flooring.	5.833458422868643
15361. he took the bottle with undue belligerence	and making sucking noises with his thick lips drained it completely.	4.030231577041202
15362. he threw his head back closed his eyes and belched ferociously.	6.388147492889155
15363. he belched again and opening his eyes threw the bottle out the	open door.	4.083443138568456
15364. well now he said and reached into his pocket.	8.024236192555906
15365. i didn't know i was gonna have company in this car.	4.486358857710431
15366. we're going to philadelphia kitty said pulling her skirt	down around her legs all the more.	5.392052803544777
15367. no i don't think	so said the big man and it was the final clincher for ernie.	5.06304841923002
15368. he	had suspected this guy was trouble and now he was sure of it.	5.633150543194609
15369. maybe you and me will girlie but these two ain't goin' nowhere.	4.5759868593143125
15370. he advanced on them and abruptly there was a shocked	electricity in the car.	6.342520911090989
15371. ernie was screaming inside himself: no	damn you you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me!	the newcomer stalked toward them and kitty shied back her hand	to her mouth.	3.2847726970144535
15372. her scream split up the silence of the car accompanied	by the rattling of the freight and then cappy came off the floor	his legs driving him hard.	5.200319554200825
15373. the kid hit the bigger man with an audible	thwump! and carried him backward in a footballer's tackle.	3.56350810758776
15374. they	went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but	flailing arms and legs.	5.979560383895229
15375. the kid showed for an instant and his	arm was cocked back.	4.032575554216411
15376. the fist went down into the pile of flesh and	ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go aaawww!	then they were tumbling again and the big man reached into the	same pocket he had gone for earlier and came up with a vicious switchblade.	4.334405739922638
15377. he held the knife aloft an instant- an instant enough	to press the stud.	4.08316536539667
15378. the blade came out with a snick! he fisted	the knife overhand and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat.	5.047523571674398
15379. kitty screamed insanely and her face was white.	4.6724501027054846
15380. she grabbed	at feathertop's sleeve and shrieked help him! help him!	do something!	they neither liked nor disliked the old man.	5.253164313632461
15381. to them he could	have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and	after mass and at noon and at six each evening- its tone repetitive	monotonous never breaking the boredom of the streets.	3.4900529016913233
15382. the old	man was unimportant.	7.162415506475537
15383. yet if he were not there they would have	missed him as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against	the screen door in early june; or the smell of thick tomato paste-	the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour- rising up from	aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth.	3.342261290649093
15384. or the surging whirling	sounds of bats at night when their black bodies dived into the blackness	above and below the amber street lights.	5.337924177119553
15385. or the bay of female	dogs in heat.	6.196054641097533
15386. they never called him by name although he had	one.	6.546767745283227
15387. filippo rossi that's what he was called in the old country;	but here he was just signore or the old man.	4.007705369650061
15388. but this was	not unusual because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance	from its elders.	5.64301050469234
15389. it went to church	on sunday and one saturday a month went to confession.	4.35831998047207
15390. but youth	asked nothing of its parents- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given	in passing.	5.474364254604335
15391. the only thing unusual about the old man had	long since happened.	4.618803676742738
15392. but the past was dead here as the present was dead.	6.409886909889932
15393. once the old man had had a wife.	6.428766872645649
15394. and once she too ignored him.	8.49131986490108
15395. with a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders she wiggled her	satin-covered buttocks down the street before him and didn't stop.	4.108599831031906
15396. in one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw	suitcase.	7.404290979767785
15397. the way she strutted down the street the old man would	have been blind not to have noticed both.	3.73794840566358
15398. without looking at him	without looking at anything except drexel street directly in front of	her she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars rode away in	it and never came back.	5.187740242811933
15399. but she shouldn't have come here	in the first place the women had said.	4.919481243564884
15400. she thought she was bigger than we are because she came from	torino.	6.208031127833205
15401. eh torino! she gave herself fancy airs!	just because she had a part on the stage in the old country she thought	she could carry her head higher than ours.	3.9285298641367756
15402. they had slapped	their thighs.	11.336718901815496
15403. it's not for making pretty speeches about dante	those actresses get paid so good.	4.0387796939671
15404. henh! calloused	fingers caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries had	swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted	never to be tweezed away.	4.86757521488233
15405. mauve-colored mouths that had never known	anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's	tongue had not smiled but had condemned again and again.	3.379325999149367
15406. puttana!	but if the old man even thought about his wife	now nobody cared a fig.	5.331440467598945
15407. it was enough for people to know that at	one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman	he had consumed- watching her become thinner and thinner in the	distance as thin as the seams on her stockings and still thinner.	3.368076621237164
15408. his	voice had not commanded her to stop.	6.743273855772659
15409. it had not questioned why.	8.376064029810436
15410. the	women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell; but he	might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog	onto him.	4.7256095318789155
15411. and his eyes- those miniature	sundials of variegated yellow- had not altered their expression	or direction.	4.061121072586382
15412. the old man's very soul could have left him and	flown down that street but he wouldn't have had anyone know it.	5.005927689350124
15413. perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come	from and where it was taking his wife.	4.181555379191586
15414. but when he called for his	withered wrinkled sister rose to care for him and the children had	he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of	her climbing into that streetcar?	5.33675744729794
15415.    there seemed to be a contemptuous	purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to drexel	street and his back in opposition to the church behind him.	5.14031783096521
15416. for all	he saw or cared to see this could have been a town in italy not the	outskirts of philadelphia.	6.0549861084319
15417. it could have been bari or chieti for	the way it smelled.	5.770281923638412
15418. what did it matter to him that the park at the foot	of ash road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the	stucco station into the city's center at half-hour intervals?	4.876281366813613
15419.  or	that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the	schuylkill?	4.317068102383446
15420. 	this place was hatred to him just as hatred was his only companion	in his aloneness.	5.2288514545018705
15421. to him they were one and the same.	5.909738380889461
15422. sameness	for the old man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided	these quarters from the city.	5.019285333977422
15423. sameness lined the streets with two-story	houses the color of ash.	4.722737697689459
15424. it slashed the sloping manure-scented	lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches.	5.683937991609345
15425. it swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges	of screen doors.	4.242655138423538
15426. even the stable-garage which housed nothing	now but the scent of rot had a lawn before it.	5.866365682613031
15427. and the coffee shop	on drexel street where the men spent their evenings and sundays	playing cards had a rose hedge beneath its window.	3.7656700850089746
15428. the hedge reeked	of coffee dregs thrown against it.	5.650577481330174
15429. only one house on the street	had no lawn before it.	5.18573772878066
15430. it squatted low and square upon the sidewalk	with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade.	5.562150632439454
15431. above it from a second-story showroom wooden angels surveyed	the neighborhood.	4.802971405592048
15432. did the old man remember them there?	7.527320760816935
15433. 	yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks-	like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill rising with	the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery.	3.4364632938339454
15434. only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses	into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards	owned no fences where one man's property blended with the next	to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy.	4.5607873775312715
15435. love and hatred and	fear were one here shaded only by fig trees and grape vines.	3.844192223842539
15436. and the	forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to	back porch.	5.578362411982167
15437. the old man silently fed upon these streets.	4.6943191927240315
15438. they	kept him alive waiting.	8.457718703298294
15439. waiting for what and for whom only he could	tell and would not.	4.222913634594242
15440. it was as though he had made a pact with the	devil himself but it was not yet time to pay the price.	7.088617176177419
15441. he was holding	out for something.	6.8185940733068335
15442. he was determined to hold out.	8.524995147246532
15443. the old	man's son threw himself down belly first upon a concrete step	taking in the coolness of it and dreaming of the day he would be rich.	3.7733304393431912
15444. at fifteen he didn't care that he had no mother that he couldn't	remember her face or her touch; neither did he care that aunt rose	provided for him.	5.462810936363697
15445. he was named pompeii as a tribute to his	heritage and he couldn't have cared less about that either.	4.179542496774234
15446. to him	life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended	only with sleep.	5.831621189080359
15447. when he would be a man he would be a rich	man.	8.336975992874603
15448. he would not be like the rich americans who lived in white-columned	houses on the other side of the park.	7.6963645580835385
15449. he would not ride the	eight-thirty local to the city each morning.	5.616230849938483
15450. he would not carry a brief	case.	10.101694740997612
15451. nor would he work at all.	6.154125703282993
15452. he would square his shoulders and	carry a cane before each step.	6.47143934498199
15453. he would sit inside the coffee shop	and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and	come running bowing with her running calling out in her bowing at	your service.	3.5456124929267046
15454. he would order her to bring coffee and would take	from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff- he would	not remove his gloves- and light and smoke.	4.724739704238923
15455. he could do that when	he would be a man.	6.930656431888001
15456. hey laura! he called to his sister	on the porch above the steps.	5.583228874976599
15457. she was only ten months older than	he.	5.998732155207709
15458. laura what would you say if i smoked a pipe?	5.9245075971793435
15459.    laura	did not answer him.	6.162967476035402
15460. she leaned unconcerned against the broken porch	fence brushing and drying her wet gilded hair in the sun.	5.3425637946163596
15461. one lithe	leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking	torn pales.	4.431469271063816
15462. her tanned foot whose arch swept high and white pointed	artfully toward tapering toes- toes like fingers whose tips glowed	white.	5.223451182691599
15463. all the while she sat there her sinewy arms swirled before her	chest.	4.816509548775283
15464. her face showed no sign of having heard pompeii.	6.830457319475756
15465. it	was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to	fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines	of its contours.	3.4982186428267132
15466. the eyes blue and always somewhat downcast possessed	a sullen quality.	5.523164502722812
15467. even though the boy could not see them he knew	they were clouded by distance.	4.889814377832396
15468. he was never sure they fully took	him in.	8.129755644066824
15469. pompeii called again laura! but the only answer	that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg	moving against it.	3.6194113245202275
15470. she's in a mood he thought there's	not a month she doesn't get herself in a mood.	5.221496244408327
15471. well	what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams	to dream about?	4.241794556471315
15472.  and as for his pipe if he wanted to smoke one	nobody would stop him.	6.671034610724511
15473. suddenly he was interrupted	in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin	and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat's claret tongue	feasting against the salt taste of him.	3.3612113499772107
15474. above the tongue an aged	yellow eye sallow and time-cast encrusted within a sphere of marbleized	pink skin stared unfalteringly at him.	5.151208170815218
15475. christ sake	goat git! but the goat would not.	4.74398283971432
15476. you're boiling	milk ain't you?	8.457718703298294
15477.  soothing it with his hand knowing the whiskered	jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly	to his touch.	3.6630092474203364
15478. his head undulated gradually covering	space to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth	of those teats.	5.181343466810619
15479. with his mouth opened wide he squirted the warm	white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light	earthy taste of it.	3.583800954448537
15480. the boy's fingers and mouth operated with	the skilled unity of a bagpipe player pressing and pulling delighting	in what he did.	4.5635753977982
15481. above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm	cloud.	5.025637018578458
15482. its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane.	6.76050597161477
15483. but the	boy could see only the goat's belly.	5.052146616597653
15484. the old man near the	corner let the shadow pass over him sensing something portentous in	it.	5.244294970542023
15485. he knew it was there knew also what it was about but he wouldn't	raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog's back.	4.048335577075445
15486. there would	be time enough perhaps the old man reassured himself to pay the	devil his due.	5.94734673343667
15487. time enough to give up his soul.	7.659930107733946
15488. in the meantime	six sandals stained an ocher the same color as pompeii's shaved	hair edged up close to him.	5.393831305455375
15489. the clapping they made on the concrete	interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew so that he quickly	released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches	for ticks.	3.492485913908738
15490. he knew at a glance that the biggest sandals	belonged to niobe the neatest ones to concetta and the laced ones	to romeo concetta's idiot brother.	5.026224194003569
15491. pompeii expected romeo's	small body to sink closer and closer to the ground.	4.590252552874382
15492. he expected concetta's	thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy and her shrill impetuous	voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that	was never sure of hearing anything.	4.6030396422752125
15493. people came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it.	5.4406829887941655
15494. the room filled with smoke and maggie's head throbbed with excitement	and fatigue but stuart had such a happy earnest look of proud	possession on his face that maggie couldn't bear to do anything to	quench it.	4.467265846576033
15495. little anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery.	4.86863345814453
15496. in two months she became a fat highly social baby with a fuzz	of flaxen hair all over her head.	5.064011549713102
15497. she stopped flying into rages and	started digesting her food; she developed a peaches and cream complexion	and a sunny disposition and she asked for nothing more of life	than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food	at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity	going on around her.	3.0815644273385185
15498. she was so heavy that maggie's arms shook	from lifting her and taking care of her.	6.031794497348891
15499. maggie couldn't seem	to	get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do:	there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety	old washer and lugged out and lugged back; there was the daily round	of household chores in which maggie insisted on participating.	3.180928159065569
15500. worry	had a great deal to do with it; stuart had been laid off at the	produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office	taking what salary his father could hand out to him.	5.303154504663597
15501. mr clifton	would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with	his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's	upkeep and besides that there were the things that had to be bought	for the baby	milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap just plain soap.	3.477030895319449
15502. maggie and stuart pored over figures every night trying to find how	they could squeeze out a few pennies more.	5.292948952135993
15503. in desperation maggie	consulted eugenia one afternoon: do you think you could	find me something i could do here at home to make some money so i could	still watch the baby and do the rest of the things?	3.6550592020745007
15504.    it	seems to me you have enough to do as it is eugenia said.	7.007254333803771
15505. she	had been watching maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to	the stove and back again.	3.685338251241182
15506. i have plenty of odd moments when	i could be doing something maggie said.	6.475681236468507
15507. it would make me	feel a lot better but the woman's exchange isn't taking baked goods	any more and i can't leave the baby with grandma because she	isn't strong enough and the baby's too young to be put in a nursery.	3.5415691556963433
15508. i should think so eugenia said.	8.610627529325885
15509. for one thing	you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the	skin out nineteen times a day.	3.9017305392397823
15510. she's so beautiful	and i do like to keep her looking nice.	5.739974350684024
15511. she picked	up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck.	4.516262660452241
15512. she'll	be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be ironed	eugenia said.	6.4181078443087785
15513. evadna mae evans said she didn't put a thing on	her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old.	3.6704742004014155
15514. evadna mae evans got all her baby clothes from best's liliputian	bazaar in new york and i'm sick and tired of hearing about	evadna mae evans.	5.239787611856327
15515. well now maggie you don't	have to snap at me eugenia said.	4.777281628687816
15516. i'm just thinking of a way	for you to be sensible.	6.161241685705251
15517. i do seem to snap	at everybody these days but i would like to think of a way to make	a little extra money.	5.276491724217686
15518. let's make	a list of your assets.	7.163184125958424
15519. maggie started laughing and she laughed	so hard she couldn't stop and she kept on laughing while she lugged	the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still	shining.	3.4502100862639447
15520. when she came back eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table	with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures.	5.489616441355147
15521. i have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working	mothers	eugenia said.	4.665699132930659
15522. we could put up cribs on the second floor	sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it's	nice and sunny but of course it would entail quite a bit of running	up and down stairs and chris said you were to be careful about that.	5.013248359095473
15523. what else?	10.509353167850248
15524.    you might set up a dress	shop in the	living room.	8.72883435224423
15525. every woman in the block has tried that.	5.240911410093794
15526. what about a tea room then?	8.356620097469762
15527.  you could set up tables	in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread	and grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes.	3.624861596183825
15528. and grandma isn't strong enough to take	on something like that and to tell you the truth neither am i.	5.779772347460066
15529. she said well those are the really interesting	things but if you don't like any of those i can turn over some	of my extra typing jobs to you if you think you can type well enough.	3.7030360846774224
15530. oh i'm sure i could do that maggie said.	7.64292356804885
15531. but	it really wouldn't be fair taking your jobs away from you.	4.57509566889673
15532. don't worry i can get plenty more eugenia said wondering	where in the world she could.	6.282289615135671
15533. maggie was looking much happier	already clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could	put up a typewriter right there and be brushing up on her typing	so eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it.	3.3893073949165315
15534. and then whenever i have	a minute i can be working at it and keep an eye on the baby and the	stove at the same time.	5.901802517081076
15535. and i can go back to my contests and be thinking	while i'm doing the washing.	4.397834493876336
15536. what are you going	to do with your feet so you don't waste anything?	6.304197151340494
15537.    maggie	laughed.	10.144513917544229
15538. she said oh eugenia i wish h   what?	7.777106874590263
15539. 	i wish i had three wishes maggie said.	4.6724501027054846
15540. all	of them for you.	9.125857505973622
15541. it grew bitterly cold toward the end of november	contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people.	4.683076263126112
15542. the temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during	the days.	5.141593231740456
15543. the cold settled like a tangible pall over the mile	high city locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and	altered its physical appearance; it had a look of grim stark realism	resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold instead of	the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy western city basking in eternal	sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and	resources.	2.9711706583050423
15544. the jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment	offices outside newspaper buildings in parks in relief lines	outside government agencies.	4.870821563645782
15545. there weren't facilities to take care	of them; there never had been a need felt for such facilities.	4.515795999827283
15546. that	kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the east	which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested	populations and their greedy centralization of industries protected	by discriminatory freight rates.	4.680578604967088
15547. the east was popularly supposed	to have got the country into war and into depression dragging the west	along; and now the east was creating government agencies for which	the west doubtless would have to pay.	3.5197846839017437
15548. the government offices	were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile	the cold penetrated everything.	5.096757622737089
15549. shivering people talked and	argued; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow	but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate	remedies and something had to be done.	4.395288515002463
15550. something had to be done;	it was the theme song of millions of american people their personal	problems no less urgent than those of the government.	6.536760943639895
15551. something	had to be done.	6.162967476035402
15552. the abernathys said it to each other a dozen times	a day.	5.803337997082046
15553. something had to be done about the furnace the fuel bills	the washing machine the doctor and dentist bills about making	money stretch for food for the mortgage for taxes for shoes for half	soles for overshoes	for clothes for the new leaks in the roof for gas	and light bills; about keeping warm about keeping well about meeting	the minor emergencies that came up once twice fifty times a day.	3.4080559448018826
15554. just dropping the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe	and stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major	disaster.	5.440852165654311
15555. the abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant	ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its	evil red depths and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained	cold.	3.719356012870803
15556. cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung	up under doors around loosened window frames from the sleeping	porches the attic from the widened cracks between shingles on the	roof.	4.9734144825690585
15557. presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity	and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen which had never been	removed when the new gas range was installed and the fireplaces and	an electric heater in grandma's room.	3.7218036081145054
15558. it was so cold and so wretched	that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them like people	stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance	so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only	important thing was to cling together and survive.	4.887726886986196
15559. the pipes	burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while	they swabbed the bathrooms.	3.4166919884221083
15560. they lived mainly in the kitchen; they	moved maggie's bed and the baby's basket there and the rest of	them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper	polar regions and plunged into icy beds.	4.572894447458697
15561. grandma said it was just	like the early mining camp days and it was the way people ought to live	only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she	used to.	4.135731675919578
15562. you said a mouthful eugenia said grimly.	8.220963398277965
15563. eugenia	hated being cold worse than anything and she was beginning to	find the joys of poverty wearing thin.	3.9232966042931583
15564. she said to maggie that it was	one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it and it was	beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever.	5.478719821692365
15565. plenty of people are poor all their lives.	4.879869921212668
15566. plenty of	people haven't our brains and talent.	6.743273855772659
15567. i know you when	you start talking about brains and talent maggie said.	4.716090102884835
15568. you're	working up to something and if you don't watch out you'll ruin	your whole life one of these days just to prove that the abernathy	family is superior to everything even a depression.	5.030747638663665
15569. the	only thing that worries me is how i'm going to prove it eugenia	said.	4.048164816144302
15570. they begged grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen	for her but grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange	beds and be seen with her teeth out and that she hoped to die in	privacy like a christian and if the lord willed it to be of pneumonia	than it would have to be that way.	5.089027969890541
15571. she didn't want to be the only	one with a stove in her room especially as her life span was nearly	run out anyway and she insisted that hope have the heater.	3.786606807144749
15572. hope wouldn't	hear of it and she took the heater back to grandma's room	and grandma took it back to hope's room and the two of them dragged	it back and forth until grandma tipped it over and almost set her	bedspread on fire.	4.912656795215014
15573. she said that proved she wasn't to be trusted	with a fire in her room and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody	knowing it.	3.7930684952709197
15574. eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the	heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth	and still wanted her own way but hope said if grandma wouldn't have	the heater nobody would have it so grandma had to give in.	4.321178597971907
15575. thrifty of her to use it up.	5.6579763784052135
15576. unusual in a case like this	but-   you can joke! didn't you read it?	5.603945128754488
15577.  she's	married that tenant!   i read it yes.	4.913686410369733
15578. this ought	to simplify tolley's life.	8.015296427524206
15579. laban had more to say.	5.619635421798327
15580. tolley	had gone to live in california.	9.128165010215518
15581. he'd mentioned it himself	at church	and everybody seemed to have the idea that tolley had left because jenny	had jilted him for roy robards.	4.248639451885037
15582. it was plain as the nose	on your face that they're laughing about it mamma.	5.7871779040122195
15583. zion stayed	to get my pin but it'll be a cold day in june when i go back.	3.685338251241182
15584. we will both go back laban! kizzie turned to go inside.	6.638388953447041
15585. let me stay and take the pictures you wanted mamma.	5.575476407777175
15586. the sun's	right-   pictures?	7.667372355461538
15587.  she swung around.	8.17994789305456
15588. what	pictures?	13.921774766768346
15589.    in brace's room! you told me to	bring my camera.	4.713566240345231
15590. i'm not going back-   indeed you are!	why should i want pictures of an empty room now?	5.347191777895021
15591.  tolley	had no idea of marrying that sneaky little jenny! this- trip of	his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants and i am going	to see that everybody at mt pleasant understands that simple fact.	3.495960590473286
15592. wait for me laban i'll be dressed in half a second!	frank followed her into the bedroom hooked her dress up the back.	4.758972536424235
15593. hurry frank! they're not going to laugh at the	fairbrothers and labans very long! tolley's going is my	fault.	3.986343565267411
15594. you know it and i'll tell everybody	exactly how it happened.	7.296670133283066
15595. she was so beautiful so valiant	so pitiable.	6.000085032661025
15596. make your confession to god kizzie	dear not to the congregation.	7.29378451987067
15597. i'll decide that when	i get there.	5.219666477665999
15598. i was so cruel to tolley so unfair.	7.726445587294289
15599. but i'll	be fair now! he is coming back isn't he frank?	4.452373707595423
15600. 	yes oh yes.	9.52328749892442
15601. what else was there to say?	6.089298979665242
15602.  returning to the log-house	he found some favorite lines from jonathan swift on his lips:	under the window in stormy weather   i marry this man	and woman together.	4.949791428557465
15603. let none but him who rules the thunder	put this man and woman asunder.	4.530758678334409
15604. absolution for his lie?	8.457718703298294
15605. 	he questioned god's taking time to telegraph the message but	he felt better about kizzie and he took the sealed envelope from its	pigeonhole wondering why he had preserved it.	3.468165702795812
15606. if he died before she	did she would never be unable to resist opening it.	6.187329320704999
15607. in any case he	would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons making them parties	to a deception peculiarly his own.	3.974340906844987
15608. it was simply his necessity	to confess which had made him write and keep this thing.	5.651138475930757
15609. you've	told god frank he said.	5.619635421798327
15610. why lacerate the- congregation?	10.570105961395418
15611. 	reaching for an old clay pot relic of pioneer days he tore	the envelope in pieces dropping them into it touching the little	pyre to flame watching it curl the red sealing wax melting and bubbling	in the feathery ash.	3.197258768416333
15612. surely now his beloved son could rest in peace.	6.2082570457271595
15613. 'and let me go for the night gathers me and in the	night shall no man gather fruit'.	3.7914910779874647
15614. a beautiful and haunting line	a subtle genius swinburne difficult not to envy a gifted man and	perhaps he did h.	4.890461327174852
15615. but there were great satisfactions even for	a small man.	5.772920220297707
15616. beyond his window were the greening trees new spring	eternal hope eternal life.	5.836351385060999
15617. there lay grand fair's quinzaine	his own young parents' graves but new life and promise for his sons	grandsons.	4.140653462139415
15618. he poured his thimble of wine for the toast he'd made	so often.	5.752586250134144
15619. but this last time he drank not	to brace but to tolley!	mr robards- jenny	was the only person she knew of in the mt pleasant neighborhood	who called him that- was kind but too easygoing.	3.4598621385616326
15620. it didn't bother	him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say howdy	miss jenny adding a careless roy but it did her.	5.2619622355214535
15621. he could put a stop to it she told him again and again.	4.525060665493043
15622. simply	call mr whipsnade oscar and dr dunne pg	and c'un major frank.	5.739974350684024
15623. mr robards laughed said he'd	feel a damn fool plain-out couldn't do that even to please her.	4.042355827182247
15624. and if i ever hear you say 'mist	laban' again i'll scream.	7.016295969617245
15625. and don't tell me you didn't	at church sunday.	5.0007819096388655
15626. i heard you!   he really hadn't	meant to he assured her but it was plain to her that the importance	of these small things was lost on mr robards.	5.036579995750367
15627. how strange it was	that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its	beautiful furnishings and fail her in- spiritual ways.	3.620712209644333
15628. another	weakness- far more irritating than his manner of speaking which	he made only token effort to change- was his devotion to that old horse	of tolley's.	4.758085556567423
15629. but mr robards' now	oh my yes indeed yes! he called her the mare much as mrs	whipsnade spoke of the queen god bless her.	3.8491282469318504
15630. h he with	fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there	in the barn was reverent only of the mare the racin'	mare the revolting gunny.	5.032285458634023
15631. for the first few months of their	marriage she had tried to be nice about gunny going out with him	to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall.	4.0935143047137865
15632. and what had happened?	11.25730144379871
15633.  gunny invariably tried to bite her.	5.219666477665999
15634. nerves	mr robards said just a nip anyway.	6.743273855772659
15635. stand back miss jen	she's oneasy of your scarf.	4.736386157698612
15636. never quit that you sor'l	devil! never concern for his wife's nerves or the danger	that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in	january.	4.711527874834075
15637. she musn't annoy gunny whose foal was due then	too!   listening for hours to his laments that the war and mist	fair's poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing	triumph and to his predictions of greatness for the procession	of foals to come jenny could look forward to years of conflict with	an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it.	3.235458127707877
15638. gunny symbolized	so much that was unpleasant- tolley the indifference with which	the fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her	and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband his lack	of understanding and sympathy in her present condition her disgusting	swollen stomach.	4.258476489908895
15639. human birth was no novelty to mr robards.	4.73427994683948
15640. tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick he suggested.	5.583228874976599
15641. jenny's aversion to having dr dunne a former admirer seemed	silly to him but he would humor her get anybody she wanted the best	never being too good for her.	3.365491072097363
15642. the chances were against his	being here to humor her when her time came she was sure.	4.860302457760714
15643. he would be	in the barn or riding for the veterinarian! night after night he	stayed with gunny in the dead of winter rubbing her with quarts of	expensive liniment fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte	russe tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come	to the house.	3.2805494163736566
15644. yet when the dear baby came he had tillie over here	in a jiffy and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when	it was all over as any husband could have been.	4.598697771093232
15645. jenny wished	now that she had had dr dunne feeling that somehow he wouldn't	have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets.	3.8589309767605684
15646. there was something	not nice about triplets though their father seemed pleased showing	no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted saying	you don't see triplets trippin' down the pike ever' day	miss jen hon.	4.7234384977239285
15647. rhyme 'em up cute- arcilla flotilla h	edmonia for her mother she said firmly jennifer for herself	and-   kezziah for miss kizzie he suggested.	3.536238854080973
15648. she	was mighty good to you past times an' this'll fetch her.	5.764724186827919
15649. now	she must be thinking of a boy-name something special.	4.670574634652682
15650. just wait till	she saw the mare's foal.	7.9862990628559976
15651. handsomest colt in all kentucky.	5.619635421798327
15652. strong	too up on his legs when he was an hour old.	7.33589141920775
15653. what about royal robards?	7.472149566047476
15654. 	why don't you name him jesus christ!	she burst into tears.	5.9245075971793435
15655. he'd had	no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been.	4.317068102383446
15656. of course she wasn't	herself right now but as her strength came back her spirits didn't	seem to rise with it.	5.403226510926414
15657. he had a good idea why not.	7.780402013289909
15658. those elegant at	home cards she sent out now she could wear her pretty clothes	again and had the house all trimmed up hadn't brought many callers	in two whole months.	4.964801029708602
15659. doc dunne and miss sis had come.	4.913686410369733
15660. so	had miss shawnee rakestraw full of criticisms about the changes here	giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his heavenly	rest last year saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town	in inclement weather was looking forward to quinzaine spa this summer.	4.290974180255165
15661. miss kizzie had been right snippy	ever since they were married though you'd have thought a namesake	would	have brought her round.	3.8163174292517237
15662. oh she'd come to see them once left silver	teething rings for all of the trips.	7.0055215430841224
15663. but when miss jen went over	right away to return the call miss kiz couldn't have been very	cordial for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there.	3.644928563218107
15664. more and more these days she'd been driving that pretty little	mare that looked like her over to tillie's and nick's- his own	old square frame box on posts chickens and cats and pups under the	house everybody friendly inside making a to-do over the babies dressed	like dollies.	4.57199957710465
15665. though he was glad she got on well with his young folks	she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land too.	4.121813248260702
15666. it made him pretty hot under the collar after the idea miss sis	had given him to be told by miss kiz that her holy spa was all reserved	for this summer and next if you please and that much as	she regretted it they would be unable to entertain mrs robards and	the children.	4.6099495870478915
15667. she hoped they were well.	6.386493532495508
15668. he didn't tell miss	jen but she must have got word from the cook or nurse who of course	knew those quinzaine nigs and she really took a fit.	4.723615475832644
15669. if he ever	did such a thing again she'd die of shame.	5.001205514136209
15670. have a	party an' leave 'em out hon he suggested.	7.334632579383801
15671. a swell party	send an invite to ever'body but them- those folks you met	at the galt house the ones i've got to know in this new jockey	club affair the whole dang neighborhood.	3.3317827031379217
15672. we'll have oystchers-	couple bar'l oystchers'll fetch in a crowd any time.	5.739974350684024
15673. i'll see	word gets round.	6.162967476035402
15674. don't you dare!   miss	jen was	funny that way funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and	perk up.	5.0479835470496015
15675. he was downright worried about her but there was one more	thing he could try h.	4.588063608164358
15676. zion was surprised when roy's buggy	stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking	home from the country school where she was teaching now that eph showers	had had a call to preach in some mountain town.	4.441357683370815
15677. roy smiled-	he did have a nice smile- took off his hat most politely	told her to hop in and he'd give her a lift to quinzaine.	3.478186328299638
15678. her hesitation	was only momentary and she hoped he didn't notice it as she	settled herself asked quickly how miss jenny and the babies were	getting on.	4.9081146434982985
15679. see for yourself miss zion.	6.645389632803208
15680. it won't take	a minute.	10.311703722752974
15681. he swung in through his own wide gateway.	4.862373123883983
15682. them's	the purtiest babes you ever did see but miss jen gets mighty lonesome.	5.448482501884564
15683. she'll relish the sight of a friendly face.	4.6724501027054846
15684. miss kiz won't	care your comin' will she?	7.683691439137331
15685.    why of course not zion	said uncomfortably.	6.238836969946059
15686. he must have forgiven me henrietta murmured to the room.	6.773187602876917
15687. the absolution of doaty's last will and testament was proof enough	of that; doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman.	3.437435944894013
15688. she found herself wishing an old wish that she had told doaty	she was running away that she had left something more behind her	than the loving sorry note and her best garnet pin.	5.0471042612262895
15689. perhaps doaty	had guessed already and kept her counsel.	5.427149619216057
15690. henrietta thought it's	extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us.	5.583228874976599
15691. there	had been more to know about hetty inevitably and most of it unfavorable.	5.272358099479889
15692. adelia was the good one or if not always good less frequently	tempted.	5.74624226452534
15693. their childhood would have been quite circumspect without	hetty's flair for drama especially through the long summers.	4.378679079251302
15694. in	winter in the city there had been the maneret school which taught	excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge; there had	been lessons in french from a small polish nobleman with a really	profound distaste for his pupils; there had been the dancing class-	miss craddock thin and tireless with her supervising wand and her	everlasting one-two-three one-two-three.	5.098612849362551
15695. there had been supper	parties and teas fetes and little balls mama small and pretty	and gay and papa enormously jocular enormously possessive the sun	around	which the blackwell planets revolved.	3.8279788834212645
15696. mama had died before	the corruption of the family circle the interruption of charles.	6.149749711748628
15697. it was safe to assume that papa sighing heavily had said many times	to his remaining daughter thank god your poor mother was spared	this and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for henrietta	to leave with her hand in charles' hand just because	her poor	mother was gone already and would never know.	3.4020038467140954
15698. mama was vulnerable;	one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her.	6.046885759498439
15699. but i would have gone anyway thought henrietta.	6.871574085805276
15700. she had always	been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no	choice.	6.860667294131164
15701. only at this moment- perhaps because it was before dawn and	she was lying in doaty's bed- she found herself examining how others	might regard her.	3.9513132299600167
15702. perhaps they would argue that morality consisted	just of that ability to see a choice.	6.301695290142976
15703. she turned on her side	finding the idea oppressive.	5.2860793776493225
15704. if adelia had felt about someone as	henrietta felt about charles would she have run away with him?	5.430739500210516
15705. 	impossible to imagine adelia feeling so about anyone.	4.6724501027054846
15706. no temptation no virtue?	10.046960268786682
15707.    a curious	thought to end a curious night.	5.486841660213515
15708. the birds were really awake now in a	colloquy of music and light was beginning to creep across the room	touching sill and door table and chair and all of doaty's flowers	in their artificial blossom and leaf.	4.573877285929156
15709. before anything else she	would go to doaty's grave with flowers from doaty's forgotten	garden.	4.426389452523709
15710. everything must wait upon this mission this sentimental duty	of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards.	5.685946547920692
15711. she closed her eyes remembering	the small french cemetery enclosed by stone walls.	4.371911722426681
15712. it had	always seemed to rain there and even the grass was gray.	6.607109297286597
15713. after	the sad impatient moment waiting for comfort which could not come	she slipped out of bed and went to the open window.	4.039122936841875
15714. the garden below	was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness.	5.228208815962298
15715. leaning	out	she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle one not quite come	to bloom one just beyond it.	3.703695656381289
15716. on a thrusting spray thick with thorns	and dewdrops and swelling pink buds like a summer valentine a bird	balanced and sang nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music	a little engine of song.	4.955264698355193
15717. it was so pretty and artless that	she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot	to play on the wet grass with all the growing things but doaty never	permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme	d'un certain age.	3.32573327760815
15718. feeling suddenly neat and subdued she dressed	quite soberly and went downstairs.	5.739974350684024
15719. rosa unbelievably was	not yet up and about reassurance that rosa was human.	4.0683852436856025
15720. feeling protective	toward this sleeping being henrietta found a yesterday bun and	milk in a white jug a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of	going barefoot.	4.67288338831304
15721. outside the garden the tame wilderness yielded	a patchwork bouquet of daisies sweet william scented stock and lady's	bedstraw which she tied with long grasses and took back to show	rosa who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing folly.	3.2442654901462724
15722. the poodle came gleefully to henrietta and begged for the flowers	supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws.	4.762804453309085
15723. henrietta held	her bouquet out of reach and said it was for doaty.	4.512577294617611
15724. rummaging in	the dew said rosa coldly.	7.163184125958424
15725. go change your shoes before you turn	around.	5.262887460641949
15726. she sounded so exactly like doaty that henrietta obeyed	her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay	home.	5.207800096369097
15727. folly danced eager for whatever lay beyond the door.	4.477601198394805
15728. to	a blackwell there was only one church.	7.985459007327242
15729. the cemetery slumbered just	behind it and the way lay through the village and close to the sea.	3.9981911470703584
15730. for the first time in thirty years henrietta walked down the narrow	street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying	her with the frankest curiosity.	5.762684889411
15731. she smiled and bowed recalling	the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child.	4.6478708416118035
15732. now some of the acknowledgments were cautious but all were interested.	7.593123808502726
15733. an old man sitting against the wall of a cottage and	waiting for the sun to find him gave her a more than reflective look	as she passed the sap still plainly rising in his branches.	3.4638320636719446
15734. on an impulse	she turned back and said good morning.	7.071055449027115
15735. he cupped his ear	and shook his head at her repetition announcing in a nettled way that	he had heard her the first time.	3.532125443252655
15736. he then offered his own estimate	of the weather which was unenthusiastic.	6.455514684636927
15737. summer's been slow to	come he said.	5.219666477665999
15738. it's my dryin' out time.	7.712079578137997
15739. he scowled at her	flowers.	6.542523493842157
15740. i'm taking them to the cemetery said henrietta	out of a vague feeling of hospitality.	5.502469023955675
15741. they'll be	takin' me next he said pleasantly but not so soon's they	plan.	4.20866622285394
15742. see half of 'em in their graves before i choose my own coffin.	5.954197733935312
15743. it's dryin' myself out that does it.	4.913686410369733
15744. he regarded her with	rising hope.	8.132854117812016
15745. you'd like to hear how i go about it.	4.477601198394805
15746. it's	nice of you henrietta said doubtfully.	7.163184125958424
15747. he straightened himself soldierly against the wall and	pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their	old boots.	3.8657299800237466
15748. his stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became	a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text.	5.447507326188953
15749. every	month f'r three days he said happily i take no water into	my system no water whatsoever.	3.744109221929566
15750. henrietta	murmured that she could quite see how it would and he nodded approval	of her womanly good sense.	5.292787497251501
15751. rests the tissues he said and	pacifies the system.	4.6724501027054846
15752. my dad did it and he lived to a great age.	6.9842128631735
15753. he looked up at her sharply.	5.47465632959774
15754. don't remember do you?	8.457718703298294
15755. 	she did suddenly through the link of memory with his father	old titus who must have been in his nineties when henrietta ran away.	3.9891635545849926
15756. next to the blackwells titus had owned the island most and she	and adelia had often stood in front of him silenced by his terrible	years- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like	a mariner more aged than possible.	5.194566719848298
15757. he had never spoken once to the	awed sisters but his son had been friendly a big fellow of fifty	or more a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea.	3.6642544476178216
15758. it must be	that son who sat before her now shriveled to half his size and half	his senses.	5.666106789682708
15759. she said gently of course i remember you.	6.3593897758181575
15760. not so well's i remember you he said.	8.028914391024678
15761. y're the	young blackwell woman.	6.162967476035402
15762. ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded	man.	5.9245075971793435
15763. i know all about you.	7.307526605218964
15764. you do seem to said	henrietta impressed.	8.89927081921279
15765. can't blame a man for leavin' his	wife he said quite cheerfully.	4.182602481535312
15766. left mine many a time only she	never knew it.	6.227426265003576
15767. man in a boat there's a lot of places he can put	in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit.	4.367175884601233
15768. any harm in that?	10.14082813704689
15769. 	probably said henrietta dryly.	6.162967476035402
15770. he gave	a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly.	6.130331029301074
15771. you'd be the one	to say he observed and she found herself liking his approval none	too well but she could not defend herself and say that her actions	were different since all actions had their own laws.	3.276875082688347
15772. only this	old man's connivance was even less to her taste than selma cotter's	open censure.	5.881614222857588
15773. well she had not come back to great island to	be understood praised or condemned.	4.296719746799222
15774. she had come to make her peace	with the past and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind	of shadow.	5.956699661452124
15775. she started to move away just as a woman came out	of the cottage a big-boned drab-haired figure with a clean apron	tied over her limp print dress.	3.5896697412289984
15776. she smiled vaguely at henrietta and	spoke to the old man.	7.074012122050333
15777. you've not had your breakfast yet gran'dad.	4.913686410369733
15778. y'r dam' porridge is no breakfast he said.	6.412214371980113
15779. milk and sops! he beat the air with his stick and it fell from	his claws and clattered on the stones.	3.737141652277779
15780. he's owly today	his grand-daughter said wearily and bent to pick it up.	5.583228874976599
15781. he's	got this idea about drying out h   it ain't an idea!	if it ain't an idea she said how comes it	you can drink beer but not water?	3.3515864650355898
15782.    he looked piously to heaven	and said beer don't affect the tissues none and the ingenious	hypocrisy of this defense pleased henrietta so that she forgave	him his	stint of malevolence.	4.637593270199637
15783. come	on do.	8.12896173865557
15784. the children are eating and miss blackwell's on her way	somewheres.	5.889762989440141
15785. who ain't?	10.919719464206153
15786. 	not me.	11.155741451300253
15787. i've got a day's work to do.	5.146930536223683
15788. you'll be visiting	miss doaty ma'am?	7.712079578137997
15789.    henrietta nodded.	8.12896173865557
15790. how much they	knew about her!   the woman	answered the nod with her own.	6.56945454776638
15791. god rest her soul she was a sweet	one.	5.97762446901789
15792. come on now.	9.789139570986894
15793. she put a strong hand under the old man's	arm and lifted him up patiently with the gentle cruelty and necessary	tyranny that the young show toward the very old.	3.4455333216550508
15794. he mumbled at her	but let himself be led off inside the house shuffling mightily to make	it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by	those who still had their wicked strength.	4.830254308228298
15795. there was a gabble	of voices from indoors young hungry sounds like cats after fish and	a burst of swearing from the old man.	4.015554568658599
15796. henrietta looked down at her	bouquet still lively with its color and scent and set her feet on their	journey's way again leaving the village street and crossing the	first field folly dancing ahead of her.	4.471452856750235
15797. at the edge of the	field the wild rolling land took over dotted with fat round bushes like	sheep.	4.359330015809483
15798. they were covered with tiny white blossoms their scant roots	clawing at the stony ground and wild birds darted in and about and	through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry.	4.790551599271721
15799. the air was full of sounds too but placid ones a terrestrial humming	as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky.	4.632415655685741
15800. she felt mindless	walking and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near	the cemetery and she caught herself wondering what she would say to	doaty.	4.86707326549766
15801. both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered	them but	the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named	dorothy tredding seemed suddenly impossible.	3.602756848929184
15802. she sat	down on the nearest fallen with age and gray with sea-damp her fingers	tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss.	4.974432537538358
15803. the day's sun was gathering its strength in gold and she wished	she had brought her parasol if only to shade doaty's flowers.	3.476957601827754
15804. a small	rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb the only angel	in the cemetery.	5.290676638931941
15805. she remembered suddenly a night of savage	moonlight and scudding clouds when she and adelia having dared each	other had stolen out of their great safe house and come here hand in	hand hoping and fearing ghosts.	3.4363567554637644
15806. the momoyama family had come from miyagi prefecture in the	northeast of the main japanese island of honshu where there are still	traces of the mysterious ainu strain.	4.952298606493271
15807. the ainus were a primitive	people already living on the island before the principal ancestors	of the japanese came from southern asia.	3.3253845082477778
15808. apparently they were of caucasian	blood.	9.409371619181048
15809. they had white skins and blue eyes; all their men	were bearded and many of their women were beautiful.	4.5172605095049905
15810. a pitiful few of	them are left now to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing	their ancient tribal chants which have the same haunting sadness as	the laments of the american indians.	4.991440756934841
15811. most of them have been assimilated	but sometimes a man in miyagi or akita prefectures is much more	hairy than the average japanese and occasionally a girl will be strikingly	lovely her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the	tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the south.	3.5524955210915308
15812. tommy	momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions.	9.863165169625333
15813. she was taller than	most japanese girls and had the exquisitely willowy form of the	japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall.	4.025364189326375
15814. her nose was higher of	bridge her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn	and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth	that were white and regular and strong.	4.841362302262055
15815. her mouth soft and full was	something for any man to dream about.	4.433524796184818
15816. she had black eyes long and	intriguingly tilted and the way she walked was melody.	6.2929222319031375
15817. she had	been in japan just one week.	5.4558319364004175
15818. it was an alien land and she hated it	intensely; she was already considering putting in rebellious requests	for duty at san diego bremerton the great lakes pensacola-	any place the navy had a hospital- with a threat to resign her commission	if the request were not granted.	4.505952317620233
15819. anywhere would be better than	the land of her ancestors.	4.643757610729249
15820. there was nothing wrong with her	job.	10.24646450873601
15821. tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward.	4.6724501027054846
15822. there were	no depressingly serious cases: the ward doctor sometimes teamed up with	the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor- sometimes the navy	sent people back to the states to preserve a marriage- but mental	health as a rule was very high.	5.405965326790137
15823. at present the doctor's main concern	was in seeing to it that japanese salvage firms were not permitted	to operate on the hulks of warships sunk too close inshore because	the work involved setting off nerve-shattering blasts at all hours.	3.4564203787887218
15824. tommy	was interested in psychiatry because there was much an understanding	nurse could do to help the patients.	5.411118559415327
15825. but she suffered in	her	off-duty hours.	6.9042399425482985
15826. such as now when she sat at a table in the coffee shop	at the officers' club having coffee and a hamburger to sustain	her until dinnertime.	4.909820927202928
15827. she had changed into a cocktail dress and the	whole evening should have been before her but already she was beginning	to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck.	3.949492461582535
15828. this was one of the navy's	crossroads- you find them all around the world.	7.4835683771175505
15829. ships from	the west coast rotated on six-month tours of duty with the seventh	fleet and yokosuka was the seventh fleet's principal port for	maintenance upkeep and shore liberty.	3.3515864650355898
15830. sooner or later all the gray	navy ships came in here; if tommy sat long enough she would be sure	to see all the young officers she had met in san diego and long	beach.	4.662183852661841
15831. and she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back	there.	4.720732848617154
15832. she felt rather than saw the approach of the good-looking	young man.	6.7942177773037935
15833. he came through from the fleet bar which was stag	with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he carried.	3.739188252596424
15834. when he saw tommy	sitting alone the tinkling sound stopped.	7.8530805626744415
15835. he was perhaps a trifle	tipsy having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted and consequently	out of practice; he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously	tailored in hong kong and he was of an age that marked him as	a lieutenant.	3.59687533026903
15836. probably off one of the carriers- an aviator.	9.002657428012444
15837. there	was a fifty-fifty chance perhaps that he would be unmarried and an	even more slender chance that his approach would be different.	4.22307681350479
15838. japan	did something to a man- and it wasn't just japan either because	the same thing applied anywhere overseas.	5.057556181613073
15839. it was as if foreign duty	implied and excused license; it intimated that the folks at home would	never know about it and therefore why not?	3.5889005410608275
15840.    then the young	man in the brown sports jacket spoke and it was no different.	7.263983758601529
15841. harro girl-san! he said turning on what was meant to be	charm.	4.333069785489003
15842. you catchee boy-furiendo?	13.00203517755798
15843.  maybe you likee date with me?	6.3025052450687955
15844. 	i beg your pardon! tommy said out of her cold	rage.	5.9245075971793435
15845. i don't believe i know you and i can't understand your	quaint brand of english- it was meant to be english wasn't	it?	3.9599606377906964
15846.    the nice-looking young officer fell back on his heels	open-mouthed and blushing.	5.365640199052516
15847. at least he had the decency to blush	she thought.	6.124142957926865
15848. oh- i'm sorry! you see i thought-	i mean i really had no idea-   oh yes- you had ideas!	tommy interrupted furiously.	4.861416487662795
15849. all wrong ones! then she	jerked her thumb toward the door in a very american gesture and dropped	into navy slang.	4.099994351209046
15850. take off fly-boy!   uh-	sorry! he muttered and took off obviously feeling like a fool.	5.800925654231955
15851. the trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for tommy.	4.925416443465917
15852. she felt like a fool too.	8.034355361246314
15853. it hadn't been this way in	college or in nurses' training; it wasn't this way in the hospital	at san diego.	4.009974480421867
15854. everybody had accepted her for what she was- a	very charming girl.	6.523714780979528
15855. nobody had addressed her in broken english at any	of those places nobody had suggested that she wasn't american.	3.8743656162316413
15856. there are spanish girls who look like tommy momoyama brunettes with	a moorish hint of the orient in their faces; there are beauties	from the balkan states who are similarly endowed and- back in the	blessed united states- they were regarded simply as pretty women.	4.552538426627191
15857. now having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not	asked for tommy was being humiliated at every turn.	3.94390584335498
15858. four little japanese waitresses were murdering	the english language at the counter- yuki kobayashi happened	to be one of them.	5.641139095287475
15859. everybody but tommy seemed to think it was charming	when they called bifutek-san! for a steak sandwich or	kohi futotsu! for one cup of coffee.	3.7440799287720785
15860. two other japanese girls	were sitting at the tables both quite pretty and well groomed.	6.180108767834228
15861. one	was with a whitehaired and doting lieutenant commander; the other	was with her american husband and their exceptionally appealing children.	3.5853166747464886
15862. seeing these did nothing for tommy's mood.	6.825630786851488
15863. she told herself	rebelliously and with pride i am an american!   and	so she was and would remain.	4.045905984484872
15864. but she was learning that so long as she	was in this country and wore civilian dress in the club there would	always be transient young men who would approach her with broken english.	5.421305557768336
15865. there had been occasions when some of the more experienced had	even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good japanese.	5.513585028851578
15866. tommy wouldn't know; after coming to america her parents had spoken	only english.	5.583228874976599
15867. one thing was becoming increasingly sure.	6.750691487993798
15868. she had been sent to the wrong place for duty.	8.44291986954372
15869. there was more to service	in the navy nurse corps than the hours in the ward.	4.4886444355211825
15870. one had	to have friends and a congenial life in after-duty hours h.	6.081505489475472
15871. now there was raucous male singing from the fleet bar.	4.901969229096001
15872. it was terribly	off key and poorly done and tommy could never admit to herself	that male companionship was a very natural and important thing but all	at once she felt lonesome and put-upon.	4.716123939563503
15873. she finished her hamburger	and drank her coffee and paid her check; she got out of the coffee	shop before the incident could be repeated.	3.9584667802572864
15874. eating while angry had given	her a slight indigestion.	6.412214371980113
15875. back in her living quarters at the hospital	she took bicarbonate of soda and sulked.	4.327625198468406
15876. then after a while	she went to her mirror.	7.1659548639278485
15877. she certainly looked	japanese and perhaps she could not really blame the young men.	4.386703608991411
15878. and	still they did not have to be so crude in their approach h.	8.301126379624456
15879. there was a letter to write to her mother and she tried to make its	tone cheerful.	5.087842395957192
15880. she promised that she would soon take a few day's leave	and visit the uncle she had never seen on the island of oyajima-	which was not very far from yokusuka.	5.062205690362163
15881. and tomorrow she would take	time to shop for the kimono her mother wanted to present to the young	wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown.	3.90090777014181
15882. tommy of course	had never heard of a kotowaza or japanese proverb which says tanin	yori miuchi and is literally translated as relatives are	better than strangers.	4.852677156597189
15883. actually this is only another way	of saying that blood is thicker than water.	4.540292463808288
15884. doc doolittle's	scheduled appearance at captain's mast was a very unusual thing	because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young	and immature and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report.	4.495727461467265
15885. but the beer hall riot in subic had been unusual too and walt perry	was convinced that doc had started it through some expert tactics	in rabble rousing.	3.5423654549788552
15886. just why anybody should wish to start a riot the	executive officer didn't know.	6.274192405606145
15887. in his opinion doc had not grown	up.	5.921111092928583
15888. the lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief.	5.595188288117979
15889. there	had never been a good reason for doc doolittle to grow up.	4.2038611678709765
15890. he had	come into the navy too young with the image of the fun-loving guns	appleby before him.	6.157875448570729
15891. the war found him much too early and its perils-	and especially its awful boredom- were best forgotten in horseplay	and elaborate practical jokes and even now doc had never found	any stabilizing sobering influence.	3.1954777910355596
15892. he remained young at heart with	an overdeveloped sense of humor.	6.303911037162704
15893. he wisecracked about the captain's	indoctrination of new men took great delight in slaughtering cockroaches	with ethyl chloride and gave no thought for tomorrow.	3.532125443252655
15894. he was doing	thirty years and the navy would take care of him.	6.986966017092254
15895. the job security	enjoyed by doc doolittle and nearly all members of the armed	forces is a wonderful thing.	4.326184767962166
15896. actually all a man in uniform has to	do is to get by.	7.253752794214045
15897. he may not rise to the heights but he can get by and	eventually be retired.	4.498000784304122
15898. doc had been under restriction to the	ship since the bustard left subic.	5.9170825857181555
15899. this deprived him of liberty	in hong kong but he told boats mccafferty that hong kong was	a book he had read before and the navy would always bring him there	again some day.	3.3328749182598028
15900. at yokosuka he was restricted to the confines of	the base because walt perry being thoughtful knew that doc might	have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the supply	base.	4.9114975455897
15901. this gave doc the whole range of the naval establishment and	suited him quite well.	4.369415501541178
15902. there were two things he wanted to do: inspect	one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the naval	base and visit an old shipmate.	5.71687974830143
15903. a telephone line had been	hooked up to connect the ship with the base exchange.	3.8552083837030713
15904. after supper	doc called whitey gresham who was now a lieutenant and had a family.	5.802848780715651
15905. well doc you old sonofabitch! whitey exclaimed	with true affection.	5.149577196870135
15906. come over and have a drink.	8.157109969019421
15907. we live down by	the base commissary.	6.364486877755695
15908. i'll be there but	i'll walk doc said.	6.743273855772659
15909. i've got to run an errand on the	way.	4.6724501027054846
15910. see you in about an hour.	8.325276189770184
15911. he threw a smart salute at	the gangway went up the dock and turned down the wide street in front	of the petty officers' club.	3.578306385017915
15912. how he wondered does one enjoy one's spare time?	6.983905482066856
15913.  he considered	some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from	dawn to dusk.	5.612143196953451
15914. then there was exercise boating and hiking which was	not only good for you but also made you more virile: the thought	of strenuous activity left him exhausted.	5.123376732606654
15915. perhaps golf with a fashionable	companion- but he'd lost his clubs hadn't played in years.	4.424643655399342
15916. there was swimming over at the riverside hotel but his skin was	so white he looked like the bottom of a frog.	5.934810131469361
15917. perhaps a packing trip	into the sierras let his beard grow- but that was too stark.	4.41966643306152
15918. i could	he thought take a long walk- but where?	6.954596198161073
15919.    the telephone	rang.	6.312547831092381
15920. you missed it buzz's voice said you should	have gone over to the pagan room with us.	6.162562176537899
15921. strippers but	scrumptious and toodle williams and her all-lesbian band.	4.477601198394805
15922. i went over to the willows and dropped	two notes.	7.448049184851186
15923. tough buzz said listen we're	having a stag dinner over at the pagan room on friday.	3.927749573093298
15924. imagine	a stag dinner with toodle williams.	7.163184125958424
15925. owen wanted to be pleasant because buzz worked the territory next	to his but he hadn't come to reno for stag dinners.	3.668957107404489
15926. thanks	owen said but friday is a long way off and anything can happen.	6.253812726241879
15927. buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims	rest.	4.317068102383446
15928. when owen was finally rid of him there was a timid rap at the	door.	6.504291338753692
15929. yes?	10.144513917544229
15930.    i'm	mrs gertrude parker a soft voice explained and i'd	like to talk to you for a few minutes please.	6.240110198592467
15931. ahah he	thought a lush divorcee at last.	4.913686410369733
15932. probably saw me in the lobby.	8.053407841425082
15933. he	was disappointed to find a nervous scrawny woman with a big hat standing	at the door.	4.422336937512661
15934. she frowned at his green pajamas with the yellow moons.	6.609227613835289
15935. how do you do?	8.293691296028912
15936.  she said semi-professionally.	13.257487900482477
15937. our	church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in alaska.	4.7152708329102255
15938. we call them lay-sisters and they go among the eskimos making friends	and bringing the light.	5.578996309488577
15939. they're up there in that freezing climate	and all of us have to try and help them.	4.071288628130401
15940. oh?	13.921774766768346
15941. 	you see she said looking past him into the room where	the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light you and i	can't understand the many hardships they have to undergo.	3.478744068558056
15942. why is that?	13.019268312417804
15943.    she apparently wasn't satisfied with	his reaction.	5.856547304788402
15944. smug owen thought smug and sappy.	7.163184125958424
15945. there was a slight	nervous twitch in the region of her left eye.	5.56270805979178
15946. it gave her a lewd winking	effect.	8.771662672223501
15947. have you ever tried to reason with an eskimo?	5.38608955272531
15948. 	she asked winking wildly.	8.457718703298294
15949. they are a very difficult group	of people.	6.081219075407487
15950. i don't know much about them owen admitted	but i suppose they have their own religion and they probably	resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not	to do.	4.935406629559903
15951. she smiled in a sickly-tolerant fashion.	5.856547304788402
15952. you know	that's very interesting.	11.1064335578917
15953. people don't know how much they give	away about themselves by remarks like that.	4.5317866800333855
15954. the more canvassing i do	the more i note how far most people are from their personal god.	5.134643902099714
15955. forebearing owen kept his peace.	5.619635421798327
15956. what would happen next?	11.084115660081828
15957. 	that she was out for a touch was certain but when did she get to the	pitch?	3.849507555006972
15958.  several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly	retreated trying to close the door a little and she slowly leaned toward	him and raised her voice.	5.028125807726122
15959. how did you get by the desk?	6.096325810139276
15960. 	he asked curiously.	9.52328749892442
15961. i'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're	wandering around the corridors knocking on strangers' doors and	talking down eskimos.	3.685338251241182
15962. oh i just come once a week.	7.573472848649923
15963. every day i visit a different hotel.	5.549195819793967
15964. i feel it's my duty.	9.806285279361543
15965. i do this	work all on my own because i understand the difficulties and i	want to help these lay-sisters.	4.178348217535819
15966. do you know these women go all through	alaska and they don't have the proper facilities?	6.227798222983791
15967.  they travel	in pairs as much as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day.	5.553033384353232
15968. do	you have any idea how far i travel every day?	6.260579868360429
15969.  i have the whole pacific	northwest.	8.195897966015838
15970. owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he	couldn't help himself.	5.884082965759568
15971. mrs gertrude parker drew back.	6.365396860175712
15972. that's hardly a christian approach she remonstrated.	6.743273855772659
15973. you're	in the secular world.	6.162967476035402
15974. i didn't say it was christian.	7.95751090267089
15975. i don't think you'll find many active christian salesmen.	4.97251910011989
15976. not that religion isn't big business; those bibles and prayer books	make a lot of money for publishing houses but they don't get top	personnel.	5.843649858614894
15977. our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics.	5.162534161349488
15978. god i take it plays no part in this she said waspishly.	6.464417135452546
15979. god doesn't have any appliance or cosmetics he said	heatedly before he caught himself.	4.303975574422738
15980. it sounded silly; why go on?	8.39397876591202
15981. 	more people were passing; he had to find some way to close this impossible	conversation.	4.304046649170031
15982. and whiskey she said smiling and	blinking at the highball glasses.	6.279602923243035
15983. don't forget whiskey; it's	such a big seller.	4.979612342185533
15984. you know he said getting a grip	on himself i think you're going to have to excuse me.	6.77394842488393
15985. i can imagine she said.	7.303730376531547
15986. probably	down at the bar.	8.457718703298294
15987. but what do you want to do about the lay-sisters?	7.455356265498005
15988. 	they must be freezing up there now.	6.743273855772659
15989. can't you help them?	6.162967476035402
15990. 	leave a card or something.	7.712079578137997
15991. i	have no card she said bitterly.	5.547012069810393
15992. you haven't been listening	to what i've been telling you.	7.266444013636366
15993. i only hope my talking to you has	helped you a little anyway because you need spiritual bucking-up.	3.968423544454309
15994. she looked crestfallen as if he had somehow disappointed the whole	human race.	7.147829404278584
15995. she stood indecisively for a moment then walked down	the hall; he heard her knocking on another door.	4.180453585032923
15996. it took him	about fifteen minutes to calm himself; then he realized he was hungry.	6.156053733126245
15997. he showered shaved dressed and went down to the dining room for	breakfast.	5.402004071823966
15998. on the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail.	7.344841905831622
15999. there	was a check from his company and the usual enthusiastic bulletins	on new lines they always issued.	4.216960436153392
16000. his lawyer had sent him a statement	on his overdue alimony and there was a letter from the collector	of internal revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last	year's exemptions.	5.500326224094754
16001. he ate breakfast in a sullen mood but	afterwards when he walked out onto virginia street he felt braced.	3.7125232616762074
16002. he looked off to the crest of the sierras still white-topped; the	glisten of the truckee river made a wide spangle.	5.106164721176895
16003. he felt suddenly	elated adventurous.	7.319732863633885
16004. with any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot.	6.372660507732526
16005. although it was only three o'clock he stopped in	at the golden calf.	5.393347670808906
16006. the tables were all spinning the dice rattling	the bar crowded.	5.377432569849584
16007. just to test himself he played roulette for quarters	on his old combination five and seventeen and within an hour he	had won surprisingly twenty dollars.	3.779400746105121
16008. the way was opening up; when	the management brought around champagne the breakfast settled its	whirling around in his stomach.	4.994092946368209
16009. the golden calf was dimly lit	with shaded neon.	4.117238665924073
16010. there were more women than men in the place but	he couldn't find a flowerpot.	7.094218374381175
16011. they all had the hard look of gamblers	who had stopped dreaming who automatically turned the cards hardly	caring what showed up.	3.720362269618053
16012. the mural around the wall depicted early settlers	in covered wagons who appeared much more animated than the gamblers.	4.653079438027171
16013. the women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from	the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance while the men were	stern but hopeful.	3.3816179253216885
16014. all of course except the donner party who were	bent on starving to death.	6.443992948072149
16015. i wonder if they did eat each	other at the end owen mused.	5.407886367704101
16016. he sat down next to a heavily-upholstered	blonde but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes.	5.401546227721915
16017. she	sighed a dirty word and left.	5.219666477665999
16018. owen was surprised to see mrs gertrude	parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged	by the entrance.	5.057556181613073
16019. she sat down and played two slots at once looking grim	as if bested by mechanical devices and owen felt sorry for the	lay-sisters depending on her support.	3.4827053136783443
16020. a dried-up cowboy sat down	next to him in the blonde's place.	6.754745524509823
16021. he was a little more authentic	than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables.	5.255419385492465
16022. what you	need is a steady martingale the cowboy announced after watching owen	play.	6.14770856867705
16023. you can't build on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen.	5.990448704034849
16024. what are you playing?	11.53137158152031
16025.  owen asked.	8.12896173865557
16026. i'm	just logging the cowboy explained.	7.712079578137997
16027. i keep all these plays in this	little black book and i watch over a twelve-hour period to find	out what numbers are repeating.	3.6109016184547382
16028. but roulette's not my game.	8.558806346535226
16029. i'm	always	trying to find a breaking table in blackjack.	5.386513477456902
16030. incidentally i'm	pretty famous in these parts: i'm called the wrangler.	6.1823554398568925
16031. don't you have to spend any time on your	ranch?	5.392880683508871
16032.    well of course i do.	11.000965489889062
16033. i'm with the	bar-h	pushing a horse called sparky.	4.913686410369733
16034. he's my own horse and what	i collect from him i use on blackjack.	5.448482501884564
16035. this sparky can rack and single-foot	and he's the fastest thing in washoe county.	4.052087672586284
16036. i figure if	i can get any kind of publicity campaign going i'll land him on	tv- you know one of those favorite horses for some western hero.	5.354926031810158
16037. i once trained a horse for hoot gibson but nothing like sparky.	4.436393050597753
16038. he's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully.	6.743273855772659
16039. five came	up while owen was listening to the wrangler and he neglected to	play a loss of ten dollars.	3.880013503385363
16040. this proved conclusively that the wrangler	was a jinx so he walked on down to hurrays an even more glorified	gambling den than the golden calf.	4.920043422202157
16041. when he looked in the back	mrs gertrude parker was marking keno cards.	4.8162923148856125
16042. his adventurous	spirit had waned; he studied the pistol exhibition that hurrays	featured as an added attraction.	5.503900045107523
16043. he ogled a long redhead with green	eyes but she was a shill with her money in front of her.	4.396392878146176
16044. he had no	great	prejudice against shills; it just seemed such a dry run.	6.370257264135987
16045. there was no cash around; everyone was flipping silver dollars.	5.448277031678145
16046. the	management discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave	the customers chips or checks or premium points.	4.985333447698777
16047. he read a special	announcement whereby hurrays would feature a special floorshow at three	am starring adele brenner and fourteen glamorous	schoolgirls.	3.6606271074526586
16048. he wondered if he might bag a tourist but	they looked frightened of him.	5.603893504423084
16049. he passed two brides both wearing orchids	and they made him feel a little sad.	3.9894859797279003
16050. owen found buzz watching	chuck-a-luck.	8.457718703298294
16051. buzz had on a hawaiian shirt and was carrying some	sun-tan oil and dark glasses.	3.8849121559715263
16052. he was shorter and fatter than owen	who felt good standing next to him.	6.035859266067051
16053. we're all going over to lake	tahoe and try our luck at cal-neva buzz explained still	instigating.	3.8101576301595865
16054. we ran into a guy at the pagan room who guarantees	we can beat the wheel.	5.881688989659712
16055. he started out as a stickman then became a pit	boss until the club found him crossroading.	3.9413769351563928
16056. he was knocking down checks	at faro.	8.524995147246532
16057. i'm allergic to tahoe owen explained.	5.219666477665999
16058. well okay buzz	said.	12.347074115237087
16059. we'll see you around later.	5.619635421798327
16060. owen went over to	the crap table and the dice were hot but he couldn't pyramid with	any consecutive success.	4.985333447698777
16061. how's your luck honey?	6.162967476035402
16062.  a	short platinum blonde in a bursting sun-suit addressed him.	6.144814417540349
16063. she looked	well-fed and prosperous but he didn't get the impression he was being	propositioned the way he'd been hoping.	3.827873915759488
16064. i haven't	had any luck since i was a baby.	7.712057631032926
16065. stake me she said	and let me at those dice.	4.477601198394805
16066. i'll make them dance the tango.	7.163184125958424
16067. we'll	get it in a hurry and get it out.	4.995040283050507
16068. let's have a drink	and discuss a merger.	6.743273855772659
16069. if you go broke she said smiling	up at him i'll leave you.	4.805189637630064
16070. sounds like real	love owen said.	7.820843401070242
16071. it sort of brings a lump to my throat.	5.058432840031124
16072. my name's gisele the blonde said after she ordered a	scotch.	6.500241895327524
16073. my mother wanted to call me sylphide	but it sounded too affected.	4.695089962491341
16074. is there any word you would like	to offer in your own defense?	7.377245675753486
16075.    spencer shook his head.	6.162967476035402
16076. alexander said answer me properly spencer.	7.252598781907077
16077. spencer	was quiet for a moment longer then he said there is nothing	i want to say captain.	4.164262283202603
16078. naval procedure he thought had its moments of grim humor.	6.107440436081067
16079. philip spencer had cold-bloodedly planned the murder of his captain	yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of proper address.	3.92318408519706
16080. during the morning hours it became clear that the arrest of	spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the somers.	6.126281016965356
16081. those named in the greek paper were manufacturing reasons to steal	aft under pretence of some call of duty so as to be near spencer watching	an opportunity to communicate with him.	3.762643578309326
16082. hostile glances were	flashed at both alexander and gansevoort.	6.412214371980113
16083. the two met in the captain's	cabin.	5.617925712142875
16084. what is the next step captain?	10.320414243819888
16085. 	more arrests i fear.	6.162967476035402
16086. in your opinion who is this e	andrews on the 'certain' list?	6.199435145800191
16087.    cromwell of course.	6.939425769494729
16088. he is the oldest and most experienced of the lot.	8.422738523553168
16089. he saw the dangers	not the glories of being identified as a mutineer.	4.7595194733196795
16090. somehow he	talked spencer into letting him use another name.	6.459377390431832
16091. there was	a tap at the door and oliver entered with the word that heiser wished	to see the captain.	4.397219811554428
16092. heiser	breathless and wild-eyed brought the chilling news that the handspikes	heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their	customary places.	5.042316430305091
16093. and also sir two articles which were considered	souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely.	3.899244195584614
16094. an	african knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by mckinley	and green.	5.734002502491268
16095. mckinley was overheard to say that he would like	to get the knife into spencer's possession and that-	where did you gather all this information heiser?	4.085397739702361
16096.  who reported	to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who-	he was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the	ladder with gansevoort and heiser behind him.	4.756346478024382
16097. a glance revealed	that the main topgallant mast had been carried away.	4.144256012964684
16098. the aimless milling	about of what had been a well-trained well-organized crew struck	alexander with horror.	5.692622247075838
16099. he bellowed orders and watched the alert response	of some of his men and watched too the way a dozen or more turned	their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for	further instruction.	3.445856284468279
16100. adrien deslonde hastened to alexander's	side.	7.712079578137997
16101. small violently jerked the weather-royal brace with full	intention to carry away the mast.	4.233705644970779
16102. i saw him myself and it was done after	consultation with cromwell.	8.002046315999603
16103. and it was	clear that adrien was not mistaken for both small and cromwell	took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast	till philip spencer had given the signal to obey.	3.7145463962164413
16104. then with disappointment	evident upon their faces they moved to the work.	6.637184002388012
16105. alexander	guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil thinking it the	ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed.	4.22654029437774
16106. their strategy	was sound enough and he reasoned had been defeated only by philip	spencer's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated.	5.061440281684852
16107. when the mast was raised alexander gave the order for small	and cromwell to be placed under arrest and now three figures in irons	sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the somers.	3.495708083011386
16108. spencer's potential followers were openly sullen and morose missing	muster without excuse expressing in ominous tones their displeasure	at the prisoners being kept in irons communicating with the three	by glance and signal.	4.481223380679198
16109. one of the missing handspikes came out of its	hiding place after midshipman tillotson had been insolently disobeyed	by seaman wilson.	4.259175816531797
16110. tillotson had reported the man to gansevoort	and an hour later with back turned had been attacked by wilson brandishing	the weapon.	4.9680304500175305
16111. wilson shackled and snarling was thrown with the	other prisoners and was soon joined by green mckee and mckinley.	3.632711015013689
16112. not a man on the brig loyal or villainous could be unaffected by	the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny.	5.735817234082495
16113. in the	tiny cabin alexander met with gansevoort heiser and wales to	speak and to listen.	4.031714729494489
16114. three days had passed since spencer's arrest	and each day had brought new dangers new fears.	5.6552908349080155
16115. gansevoort said	it requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we	can now rely.	3.744109221929566
16116. to have the greek paper is not the great help that at	first flush it seemed.	7.381191806898802
16117. from actions aboard it is easy to guess that	spencer's boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate.	4.329220526339161
16118. well heiser ventured why don't we hold an investigation	with questioning and-   that would be worse	than useless alexander broke in.	5.710902953784634
16119. there is not space to hold	or force to guard any increased number of prisoners.	4.793717660774066
16120. besides suppose	we hold a court of inquiry then what?	6.801360725969141
16121.  then we have informed a large	number of our crew that when they reach the united states they will	be punished but that in the meanwhile they may run loose and are	expected to perform their jobs in good order.	3.929025705860714
16122. mr heiser does this	sound like a truly workable plan to you?	6.144710247514505
16123.  do you not think these men	might choose the black flag here and now?	4.5833486138360575
16124.    wales said	of	course they would.	8.457718703298294
16125. they are about to do so at any moment as it	is.	5.901308373041849
16126. all that is needed is for one man to feel self-confident enough to	take the lead.	6.142554902066195
16127. as soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the	others or by a signal from spencer we are going to be rushed.	4.398496651847057
16128. we	are going to be rushed and murdered.	8.306061952085578
16129. that is extravagant	language mr wales.	7.391913199301079
16130. we are not going to be rushed and murdered	alexander said.	9.883597033366481
16131. we are going to bring the somers into new	york harbor safe and sound.	5.513072519927473
16132. of course i agree with	the captain gansevoort said thoughtfully but the conspiracy	is ferocious and desperate.	6.197920163963519
16133. the instinct of discipline has been lost.	4.280553672808819
16134. anything is possible when anarchy has the upper hand.	6.144814417540349
16135. he paused	then added everything on a ship is a weapon.	4.467047448170571
16136. implements of wood	and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where	a man stands.	5.138210239895059
16137. and we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many.	4.42808827291125
16138. we ourselves must stand sentinel.	9.027516166786425
16139. under arms day and night watch and watch about.	5.260532310823803
16140. those of us present	the perry brothers deslonde and the other midshipmen now have	the responsibility of the somers.	7.200713928421877
16141. a great deal of labor we have	as well for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed.	4.2539390302962286
16142. and when he was alone again in the cabin alexander lowered his	head into his arms and wept for he knew full well what must be done	what in the end would be done.	5.397129277697107
16143. with all his heart he had loved the navy	and now he must act in accordance with the navy's implacable laws.	4.5340365617197875
16144. and when he did when he gave to his ship that protection necessary	to preserve her honor he knew he would lose forever the navy to	which he had dedicated his soul.	5.036929589490559
16145. where had he failed?	7.694358264547413
16146.  how	had he failed?	9.52328749892442
16147.  he who had tried so hard who had yearned so passionately	to be a great officer.	4.265032732812862
16148. it came to him as he wept there aboard the	somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek	to storm the gates of heaven.	5.221207706426026
16149. it was given or it was not given.	6.407631781262803
16150. one	did one's best and if fortune smiled there was a reward.	6.604677109993971
16151. one did	one's best and if fortune frowned an eighteen-year-old boy with murder	in his heart sailed aboard one's ship.	3.8657284122515825
16152. and alexander sobbed	like a girl for the dreams he had had and he felt no shame.	5.351897853311759
16153. god knew	his tears were his to shed if he so desired for it had not been with	an egotist's rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career.	3.9543437294877437
16154. another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist.	6.152157538074065
16155. it	was for love that he had served the navy.	5.7796847907575355
16156. to have someday that love	returned was what he had lived for.	6.910201700130389
16157. now the hope was gone.	7.405669343967543
16158. yes he	would bring the somers safely into new york harbor but at a price.	5.846885737977466
16159. dear god at what a price.	5.285408026518084
16160. and after a while he dried	his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and	dignity.	5.2903285636688535
16161. stern-faced he inspected the prisoners satisfying himself	that they were clean well fed and comfortable within reason.	3.744109221929566
16162. the prisoners	averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger.	4.983240996215937
16163. only cromwell the giant boatswain was mild-mannered and respectful.	5.1298183412245
16164. he said captain may i speak please?	8.449761677617253
16165.  captain	i am innocent of any plot against you or the ship.	4.182602481535312
16166. are	you cromwell?	12.204832733497735
16167.    yes sir.	10.721985298649644
16168. before god i swear i am	innocent.	8.618064366453213
16169. i know nothing of any plot if there is such a thing.	5.0336509673471355
16170. you are the only man aboard who can be in doubt.	7.641374756753745
16171. i cannot speak for others sir but i am innocent.	5.430435688336445
16172. he leaned	closer to alexander squinting up at him from the deck.	6.391804880085015
16173. surely captain	you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything.	4.001506166704711
16174. no cromwell i did not find your name.	8.307563384403048
16175. you were careful	about that.	8.083515243458141
16176. now spencer seeming with effort to shake	himself from lethargy spoke.	6.563548970557644
16177. he said cromwell is telling you the	truth.	6.157169353373897
16178. alexander shifted his gaze to spencer.	7.252598781907077
16179. the calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness	of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend	cromwell.	3.4586854461618093
16180. alexander knew spencer too well to think him nai^ve or	thick-skulled.	5.977237358798663
16181. and in a sudden wave of painful clarity alexander recognized	a kinship with spencer.	5.071914280584668
16182. here was another human who understood	the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable.	6.568212196343986
16183. there was good fortune	and there was bad and philip spencer in handcuffs and ankle irons	knew it to be a truth.	4.7120915452522585
16184. he expected nothing for himself but that	which naturally follows those marked for misfortune.	5.748728578812353
16185. the red-haired	captain towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority	was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon philip spencer.	3.4603470838344004
16186. this tragic lad had forged his own shackles.	6.600382403185883
16187. but he could not	have done so could not have found the way had fortune favored him.	4.492923862397668
16188. and because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the red-haired	captain they would be each other's undoing.	5.5466440319297385
16189. spencer	if there is guilt if you do not deny your own how is it possible for	cromwell to be innocent?	3.7464412471543964
16190.  he was your constant companion.	9.357464703205716
16191. the hazel eyes met alexander's.	4.747750369463677
16192. i tell you he is innocent.	8.074761169396105
16193. and do you think there is a reason why i should accept	your word?	5.094323426133699
16194.    yes.	13.921774766768346
16195. i have nothing to gain by defending cromwell.	5.95670835531741
16196. nothing to lose either spencer.	8.979630056661012
16197. that's	true spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation.	4.477601198394805
16198. his eyes went back to contemplation of the sea.	6.92671635964213
16199. i	am innocent captain cromwell said again.	5.656959610017401
16200. before god captain	i am innocent.	9.47104162550159
16201. and though it was logical that a man	who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth still	it was difficult to understand why spencer spoke only for cromwell.	3.5020612206601
16202. the boatswain was as guilty as any.	5.8743971957932475
16203. no action of his could be interpreted	in his favor and four midshipmen prior to their knowing the	significance of the greek paper had seen it in cromwell's hands	while spencer whispered explanations.	3.5211478271677508
16204. i thought midshipman	rogers had told alexander that spencer was teaching him	geometry.	6.354465057492727
16205. it was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles	to the wardroom where a class of apprentices awaited him.	3.767178253952826
16206. this	was a training ship and the training would continue but there was an	element of frightful absurdity here which alexander recognized.	5.261510282031289
16207. some	of these apprentices were in physical strength already men and doubtless	a percentage of them were spencer's followers.	4.016385387349912
16208. rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to	study the torah.	5.331440467598945
16209. bits of trash lay in the roadway.	5.181376916946381
16210. the air smelled	warmish and foul.	7.352232318684315
16211. a young man appeared out of a side alley and	walked toward us with quick strides.	4.632795438447044
16212. he wore a long double-breasted	coat of a heavy material dark trousers and black boots with buckles.	5.538230771830435
16213. his black hat with its wide brim high crown and fur trim rode high.	3.997339527693703
16214. with his head erect he approached not glancing at us and passed	by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead.	5.220185776294384
16215. he had a pinkish-white	complexion a small straight nose a short black beard and	tightly curled paot.	4.6199478149083815
16216. i was suddenly conscious of my bare arms.	7.7291331826012915
16217. the	girls in the market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered their	legs with cloth stockings.	4.279017195332595
16218. i turned and watched him stride down the	center of the road.	6.474222581700361
16219. his hands were swinging at his sides and he passed	through the dingy market place with his back straight and pivoting	on his heel he entered an old stone building.	3.378411424561486
16220. rachel had seen	me watching the young man.	6.743273855772659
16221. when your mother was here	he must have been a young boy.	5.713370196163984
16222. like the ones you will see now.	8.41645238471676
16223. i swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside	rachel.	4.597862312200925
16224. she led me into a twisting side alley.	7.057872112361533
16225. the dirty discolored	buildings looked boarded up and their few windows stood high above	our heads.	3.570845587849075
16226. rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most	of the buildings.	5.9245075971793435
16227. we entered one where the front door stood ajar and	climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor.	3.782952247703496
16228. an old man with a	white beard and dressed in a long shabby coat baggy trousers and a	black skullcap greeted us.	5.734746399730779
16229. he nodded clasping	and unclasping his hands over his paunch and flicked glances at me.	3.9894859797279003
16230. i thought he would ask us to leave because rachel and i were bare-armed	but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor.	5.194376942749426
16231. his toes pointed out toward the walls.	5.148511793411897
16232. he stopped in front of a	door placed a finger on his lips and still peering down into his beard	pushed open the door to a classroom.	5.720279884810944
16233. he left	us.	8.80323508231408
16234. little boys crowded together on long wooden benches and	in the center of the room sat the teacher.	6.431969523173936
16235. his black beard dripped down	over the front of his coat.	4.86428162051399
16236. one white hand poised a stick above his	desk.	7.186359328943102
16237. he turned his surly half-closed eyes toward us stared for	a second then shouted in yiddish one two three! rapping	the stick against the desk.	3.605961747046719
16238. the little boys shrilled out a yiddish translation	or interpretation of the five books of moses which they	had previously chanted in hebrew.	5.063258620512382
16239. they chanted a fixed tune in time	to the report of the stick.	4.798274121638716
16240. each boy opened his small mouth wide and	rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and	great-grandfather	had studied and prayed in the ghettos of europe.	5.389404548630421
16241. they had large bright eyes the small upturned noses	of all babies everywhere and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets	of paot framing their little white faces.	3.7253262389456783
16242. they bent over	yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher.	6.411009244235889
16243. since they	did not glance curiously at us once i guessed that there was a penalty	for distraction.	4.738570196173732
16244. the guttural language from the ghetto stopped.	5.8743971957932475
16245. the teacher plunged the children into a new portion this time in hebrew	rapping the stick incessantly.	3.5413291623688354
16246. one boy who rocked back	and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and freckles.	5.587459129998056
16247. his tightly	curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders.	4.658011605191661
16248. in the center	of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap.	6.198569655273633
16249. his head barely	rose above the table.	5.491566577692657
16250. i stared at him for a long time.	8.227398639597208
16251. he did not return	my interest.	7.946500561346033
16252. my eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the	one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the	boys.	4.945008311735035
16253. some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the	words long ago.	5.120139063931624
16254. they singsonged the portion at the teacher who accompanied	them in an off-key baritone and spurred them on with the stick.	5.031164312904003
16255. the tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake.	4.173704839079438
16256. i could	not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair.	6.790091318773337
16257. his body pitched	back and forth on the bench.	4.993812279451709
16258. his front teeth were missing.	8.16490567933018
16259. i	shuddered and backed out of the room.	6.267938334830005
16260. rachel followed looked at me	and clucked with her tongue.	6.144814417540349
16261. we walked down the cool hall silently.	6.239870171127983
16262. from behind us came the rapping of the stick and the high-pitched voices	of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and	prayer.	4.923062771380638
16263. i said how long do they keep that up?	4.850305041014002
16264. 	all day she said.	8.457718703298294
16265. except for shabbat when they are praying	all day.	6.218086893881253
16266. i rubbed my hands together.	8.667966011188964
16267. they had turned	numb and prickly in the classroom.	5.680249775836617
16268. the old man in the baggy clothes	waited at the foot of the steps.	6.7930454780437035
16269. he glanced down into his beard and	muttered something in yiddish.	4.467047448170571
16270. rachel said he asks for money.	7.163184125958424
16271. i reached into the pocket of my skirt	fingered ten pruta and dropped the coin.	4.118642075596688
16272. then i picked it up	again and handed it to the old man.	8.166476585984723
16273. i didn't look at	him.	7.028761150033486
16274. does this bother you?	11.294482146470433
16275.  i	said.	10.144513917544229
16276. most of our sabras think it's	horrible.	10.350216105570379
16277. when we were fighting a few of our orthodox people were	lying down in the roads so we could not pass.	4.75331470012036
16278. they said that we must	not fight but wait for the messiah.	6.0639976778550295
16279. you	had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and	appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home.	3.6965126650888527
16280. you had to be stupid or crazy or immortal.	8.839217197592847
16281. i was	american.	9.686204316035266
16282. you had to know also that you were going to fail.	7.554234593278913
16283. all	of it might have been heroic but they had done it in the wrong place.	5.433132266763297
16284. rachel faced me.	9.52328749892442
16285. her bright eyes were twinkling.	6.54737746395194
16286. she said sometimes i think they are keeping religion for	us while we play around.	6.122216371572698
16287. your mother hated this way of life.	5.880379802112072
16288. she	wished to change much for the children here.	6.724621352521143
16289. i said quietly	respectfully what did she do here?	5.095208398041368
16290.  in this section?	12.799335454269174
16291. 	rachel	clicked her tongue behind her teeth.	5.219666477665999
16292. but when	she saw the children you have just visited she wanted to take them away	and put them out in the country in the kibbutzim.	6.152953881867963
16293. she was a strange woman your mother.	6.9795345620658775
16294. when she loved it was	with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those	things she loved.	5.499081926562054
16295. nothing was too impossible for her to do when she	wanted.	4.844000287526691
16296. she stayed here to work for aliah.	8.459110120246903
16297. for many immigrants for	many children the first thing they knew of israel and freedom was your	mother.	4.51331455073893
16298. sometimes it was dangerous for her.	9.31138371051052
16299. but she loved danger.	7.769151267129032
16300. she took it with her wherever she went;	she chose it.	6.7960000495148325
16301. and i think she sought out danger as much as she sought	out helping other people.	5.349641589839424
16302. she was most strange woman.	9.847346884978734
16303. ready to	follow her impulse.	6.162967476035402
16304. it was an impulse when she was here in me'a she'arim-	i was with her- that led her to stay in israel.	5.95649586990751
16305. your	mother wanted to bring children to israel so that they could leave	their ghettos.	4.7689162109415815
16306. here they did not need to be in ghettos.	12.226919628763872
16307. if she could	not take the children out of this section at least she could take other	children out of their countries and put them on the farms.	4.271870646266217
16308. she set	out to make sure that no jewish child anyplace in the world had to	live in a place such as this.	6.04455155383855
16309. i said quietly gaining nerve	ready to ask any question at all no matter how intimate ready to	be rebuffed then why did she leave israel?	3.7831155035295043
16310.  i'd like to know	that very much.	7.163184125958424
16311. rachel clasped her hands together and slowed	her pace.	4.6724501027054846
16312. the soles of her sandals reported sharply on the cobblestones.	5.315964723648707
16313. she pursed her lips then clamped them together so tightly that	i thought she was angry with me.	3.9293269809420077
16314. but she sighed and her face relaxed.	7.980361787009956
16315. trouble came into her life.	5.619635421798327
16316. she had good friends here people	who liked her.	7.810915822845461
16317. but she had to go out and hurt herself.	6.413803502907165
16318. there was a man here in town.	11.089777584645285
16319. he helped her meet people so she could	go out and do the work she wanted.	3.9072530517863884
16320. there was	a refugee who was able to come here because of her.	7.5815525825505
16321. he came with his	son.	6.95063397874449
16322. at first i thought they were relatives of your mother but it	was not so.	6.8331507868751515
16323. this refugee was a middle-aged man a big handsome man	with a strut to his walk as i have never before seen.	3.877988777597545
16324. he had the black	numerals on his arm so he had been branded in a concentration camp.	6.920249320485199
16325. yet he walked like a young man.	5.756405325175529
16326. often he was terribly despondent	and talked to no one.	6.870395732629805
16327. then he would walk off for a few days alone in	the direction of europe.	5.367892797271576
16328. all his family was dead except for his son.	7.080825262589318
16329. your mother would always retrieve him when he wandered off and she	would send him home to his son.	4.07001943375138
16330. he loved the son and was always glad	to be sent back to him.	5.916551948373256
16331. then his son did something- rachel threw	up her hands- i don't know what but something to an official	here- it was during the mandate- and the son was imprisoned.	3.5641468731272803
16332. a	few hours after the son was arrested your mother was informed.	5.739974350684024
16333. she	ran from a little group of us.	4.913686410369733
16334. we were sitting together talking.	9.987620347893555
16335. she	went to the father and found he had hanged himself.	4.376325627517466
16336. it was silent in the stone alley.	7.711906994129459
16337. then she continued with energy	i myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find	the father.	4.031931911091229
16338. no one saw her except the man reuveni.	7.869248266939944
16339. i know him.	9.73542913782813
16340. rachel gave me a direct bright-eyed	look.	7.922535238093051
16341. she said reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep	interest in this refugee.	4.854527941302612
16342. he said she would only hurt herself.	8.444716804331742
16343. he complained	to me once that i must talk to her.	4.467047448170571
16344. when i did she shrugged	her shoulders and said that reuveni wanted her to marry him.	6.375355694324185
16345. i asked	her if she would and she said she would not.	4.760672484528126
16346. he had known when	he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she	did not intend to marry him.	5.558313297682073
16347. anyway i did not see her until two	weeks after the refugee hanged himself.	4.44260374329903
16348. she came to me one day.	8.514392209600063
16349. she	was pale and skinny; she was terribly alone.	4.697647217969309
16350. and she said that after	this man had been dead for a week she had gone to reuveni and accepted	his proposal.	5.779509357465462
16351. he shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldn't	understand why she had upset herself.	3.770206449411329
16352. but now he was happy she	would let him straighten out her life and take care of her.	5.947371027798857
16353. he would	never let her harm herself again.	5.131969917669621
16354. for one whole week he never let her	stay alone.	7.344620032114169
16355. she let him lead her around.	5.856547304788402
16356. he took her to a doctor	for she was run down nervous did not care where she was.	5.691485938775134
16357. reuveni took	her with him wherever he went.	4.913686410369733
16358. he did not let her talk to people;	he did not let her choose her own food.	6.20867387827293
16359. she was limp and beaten from	her loss; she did not care.	5.024718727286361
16360. and i'll take you with me.	7.771377502193086
16361. the two of them against the world.	5.587694213979407
16362. that had been how she imagined it.	8.789808701236927
16363. for when he began to talk and	dream all at the same time making his plans as he went she had begun	dreaming too.	4.4139112141667844
16364. but now the dream was over.	9.648729895581782
16365. the big waking up had happened.	5.1348477643806545
16366. what did i imagine?	10.503831918218912
16367.  she thought.	9.848420478905924
16368. did i see	him about to swing low in a chariot?	6.4697894422808755
16369.  or maybe poling up the south	fork of the forked deer river braving the wastes dumped in it?	3.975856883880846
16370.  maybe	i saw him on a barge with a gang of ethiopians poling it.	5.8125825947154155
16371. and i'll take you with me.	5.662844612144823
16372. he had taken her all right.	9.262212980186456
16373. wednesday nights after youth fellowship.	5.619635421798327
16374. out of the church and into	his big car it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights	sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college his expansiveness	the quaint little pine board tourist courts cabins really with a	cute naked light bulb in the ceiling	like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were	a kid where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs watching	a room complete with moths pinging	the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls an insect	highway patrol with feelers waving.	4.364262553329566
16375. and the bed that sagged in	a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before	and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when	gratt went out for ice the sound coming through the walls like something	on the other side of the curtain so you knew they heard you	when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had	heard you listened.	3.285773189204794
16376. and gratt shafer would be in memphis today	for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like	everybody knew he would just like everybody knew all along.	4.873783107986501
16377. like	mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and toonker burkette	back in his office yanking out teeth like they all knew he would.	3.4574335574998396
16378. just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and	wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like	that would happen.	4.7631727970069315
16379. or you could hope the parachute wouldn't open	just so you could say you saw it not open not because you meant any	harm to starkey	poe in his suit of red underwear but mainly because	you were tired of being an old maid- a thing which cannot admit when	it thinks it might be pregnant but must stand the dizzy feeling all	alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to	say to somebody in a normal voice: i think i'm pregnant.	3.0873695811600537
16380. or you could wish your daddy would really do it-	kill gratt shafer like he said when you all the time all along	could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured	tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night.	5.035468422145797
16381. so you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to	the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights waiting for you	for your new spectator pumps waiting for you to squat by yourself out	there in your tight skirt crying and afraid and trying to get that damned	son-of-a-bitch tire off because that is being an old maid too	if you happen to drive a car it is changing the tire yourself in the	night and in the mud and the rain hating to get out in it but afraid	to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help.	3.387471593900584
16382. and every sound that	might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped	you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won't tell	a combination like ham and eggs rape her and kill her and that	is being an old maid too.	4.707880321273861
16383. it is not having his baby nestled warm	and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really	gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull.	4.195167084165175
16384. and most of all it	is not having the only man you could love whether he drives a bread	truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds	or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines for if you are	anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the	one.	4.92154165346478
16385. he can even be a mild-voiced little-town guy with big-town	ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even houdini couldn't figure	out how it is unlocked.	3.8242720213664367
16386. and he can be on the way to memphis your	gratt shafer can and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and	love him and want him even if it means you want him- really want	him- dead.	5.406362509226634
16387. because if you can't then nobody else can either	nobody else can have him.	4.524828995763033
16388. for you don't share him not even with god.	6.652741683833405
16389. if it is love you don't.	7.918799484873502
16390. and i'll take you with me.	7.771377502193086
16391. even if that's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give	the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will	always believe it even when it is finally the only thing in the world	you have left to believe and the whole world is telling you that one	was a lie.	3.5341443643106456
16392. even when he is on the way to memphis you will still	have the promise resting inside you like a gift and it is he inside	of you.	7.436440036873322
16393. and in a way the promise works out true for whether he wants	you or not you go with him in your heart.	4.522421341049312
16394. you feel him every mile	further away.	8.900940051485842
16395. you feel where he is and what he sees and at night you	feel when he is asleep or with the other woman the one that never could	love him the way you do the one who got him because she didn't	particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't.	3.931920863242999
16396. and you know	you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted	him so bad that you didn't get him and you can feel nearly sorry	enough to cry when you think of that other guy the chump who begged	you to marry him the one with the plastered hair and the car he couldn't	afford and the too-shiny shoes.	4.350239976469363
16397. you think: did he feel	that way about me?	5.603064169507924
16398.  it comes to you that probably he did feel that	way	to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have gratt shafer;	that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to	turn on or snap off when you got tired of him that other guy.	4.605824283599522
16399. it dawns	on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table	from you he was a man and that because gratt shafer was making	you miserable you were passing it down to him to gratt shafer's	substitute that other guy.	3.96628882723226
16400. and you wonder if that is why the little	man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he	straightened out and moved to st louis where he got to be a big	unhappy success.	5.312789026043515
16401. you wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of	you.	4.789739462758691
16402. you wonder about the christmas card with no name on it and it	comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody	else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself to give somebody else	the one they wanted- to give them you.	5.027140652611938
16403. damn the world	she thought.	6.162967476035402
16404. she looked out at the corn field the great green deep	acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewashed	fence bordering the grounds.	5.398568203117591
16405. the mayor envisioned factories there.	5.568511012049752
16406. homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway instead	of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your	heart while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand	and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments.	4.548706203568865
16407. the bands were impatient	but they were the only ones.	4.919549924126596
16408. the others the ones in the stands	were spellbound for hearing the mayor was for them like listening	to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in new york city.	5.073340017297918
16409. it was	like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano	virtuoso rehearsing.	4.668320437582259
16410. he was good and they knew that what he was doing	for them he would do all over the united states some day.	6.792460926557179
16411. so they	stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it not	listening exactly but rather feeling.	4.308110829686892
16412. if a man was good if he	was going to be governor you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever.	6.388219706431023
16413. you were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up	there you were someone else and the world was something else too.	4.24651158526731
16414. it	was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it.	5.603744999868198
16415. you	laughed and then your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a little	bit and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and	the goose bumps rippled along your arm.	3.2374944985512153
16416. he hit the theme about dying	to defend your country and you were ready to do it right then without	a second thought.	5.256285924411898
16417. while he talked you wouldn't trade being a west	tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world	no matter if it hadn't in six weeks rained enough to wet a rat's	ass.	3.7518279454973205
16418. she glanced at the man nodding beside her a man with	weather cracks furrowed into his lean cheeks with powdery pale eyes reflecting	all the droughts he had seen reflecting the sky and the drought	which must follow now in august- yes with eyes predicting the	drought and here it was only june only festival time again and thoughts	of gratt shafer would not leave her.	4.346975118854505
16419. i should have stayed at	the store she thought.	5.441073443092646
16420. back at the factory-to-you with	the other old maids back there she was the youngest clerk and she was	thirty-four which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working	conditions like the unventilated toilet with the door you had	to hold shut while you sat down.	4.591414181057281
16421. there was no lock because herman didn't	allow a lock.	5.752946426906755
16422. a lock on the toilet would encourage malingering	and primping.	6.079857070838671
16423. the toilet hadn't had a sincere scrubbing in years and	there were things written on the walls of the little boxed-in place	because you couldn't keep the public out- entirely.	3.32495745935211
16424. she could not	count the times herman had rapped on the door just a couple of bangs	that shook the whole damned closet and might someday break away the	pipe connections from the wall.	4.974551027286876
16425. the two little bangs meant that he	was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that	if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out by the opposite	door handle which she would be clutching whichever-the-hell clerk it	was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot.	3.3717599068666297
16426. and the hours were six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night	on saturdays and during sales and there were no chairs and you couldn't	smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter	or janitor.	5.5438718551389945
16427. among us we three handled quite a few small commissions from	spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick	lettering jobs.	3.9170368153168345
16428. each of us had his own specialty besides.	8.515238610669433
16429. george	did wonderful complicated pen-and-ink drawings like something out of a	medieval	miniature: hundreds of delicate details crammed into an eight-by-ten	sheet and looking as if they had been done under a jeweler's	glass.	3.8176454278971255
16430. he also drew precise crisp spots which he sold to various literary	and artistic journals the new yorker for instance or	esquire.	5.246962432332656
16431. i did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints:	naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the	doorway daring the cops to take him is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching	a revolver.	3.317090032942904
16432. the book could be the brothers karamazov but	it would still have the same jacket illustration.	5.584405295148033
16433. i remember once i	did a jacket for magpie press; the book was a fine historical novel	about edward 3 and i did a week of research to get the details	just right: the fifteenth-century armor furnishings clothes.	3.5422788039310014
16434. i	even ferreted out the materials from which shields were made- linden	wood covered with leather- so i'd get the light reflections accurate.	4.807873378411027
16435. mckenzie the art editor took one look at my finished sketch	and said nothing doing rufus.	3.8101576301595865
16436. in the first place it's static;	in the second place it doesn't look authentic; and in the third	place it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place-	you've got six colors there including gold.	5.724653724485214
16437. i said mr mckenzie	it is as authentic as careful research can make it.	4.220516216134808
16438. he	said that may be but it isn't authentic the way readers think.	6.447967982542838
16439. they know from their researches into television and the movies that	knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like little	lord fauntleroy and only the villains had beards.	3.952833545414469
16440. and girls couldn't	have dressed like that- it isn't transparent enough.	6.27952015821472
16441. in the end i did the same old picture the naked girl and the guy in	the doorway only i put a lord byron shirt on the guy gave him a	sword instead of a pistol and painted in furniture from the stills of	a costume movie.	3.3586899435241366
16442. mckenzie was as happy as a clam.	6.743273855772659
16443. as for donald he actually sold paintings.	6.209477021462997
16444. we all painted in our spare time and we had all started as	easel painters with scholarships but he was the only one of us who made	any regular money at it.	6.476353614727153
16445. not much; he sold perhaps three or four	a year and usually all to joyce monmouth or her friends.	3.9405934082691783
16446. he had style	a real inner vision of his very own.	6.888195262259749
16447. it was strange stuff- it	reminded me of the pictures of a child but a child who has never played	with other kids and has lived all its life with adults.	3.6030759199017472
16448. there was	the freshness of color the freedom of perception the lack of	self-consciousness	but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and	smack you in the eye.	5.284882399384149
16449. we used to kid him by saying he only painted	that way because he was so nearsighted.	4.50705892885769
16450. it may have been true for all	i know because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles	but it didn't prevent the paintings from being exciting.	5.550512616522201
16451. he also had	at times an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker; he would	look right through you while you were talking to him and if you said	for christ's sake donald you've got prussian blue all	over your shirt he would smile and nod and an hour later the paint	would be all over his pants as well.	3.3217893759538812
16452. mrs monmouth thought of	him as her discovery and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a	painting.	5.648179024651404
16453. it was all gravy and donald didn't need much to live on;	none of us did.	4.225301140862824
16454. we shared the expenses of the studio and we all	lived within walking distance of it in cheap lodgings of one kind or	another.	5.282441608096287
16455. attending the life class was my idea- or rather askington's	idea but i was ripe for it and the other two wouldn't	have gone if i hadn't talked them into it.	3.7838206537768913
16456. i wanted to paint again.	9.458580198959387
16457. i hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year.	4.653836632802373
16458. it wasn't	just the pressure of work although that was the excuse i often used	even to myself.	6.488343785490684
16459. it was the kind of work i was doing the quality of	the ambition it awoke in me that kept me from painting.	4.260149904739243
16460. i kept saying	if i could just build up a reputation for myself make some real	money get to be well known as an illustrator- like peter askington	for instance- then i could take some time off and paint.	4.750103265543913
16461. askington was a kind of goal i set myself; i had admired him	long before i talked to him.	4.030208847571429
16462. it looked to me as though he had everything	an artist could want joy in his work standing in the profession	a large and steady income.	5.457952213503389
16463. the night we first met at one of mrs	monmouth's giant parties he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket	with silver buttons and a soft pink viyella shirt; instead of a necktie	he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set	a lump of pale pure jade.	2.994847521485363
16464. this set his tone: richness of texture	and color and another kind of richness as well for his clothing and	decorations would have paid the brush-off's rent for a year.	4.727839042597255
16465. he was	fifteen years older than i- forty-four- but full of spring and	sparkle.	4.334355528989187
16466. he didn't look like what i thought of as an old man and	his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger.	5.143575264169017
16467. he was one	of the most prominent magazine illustrators in america; you saw one	of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national	magazines every month.	4.179014023715649
16468. life had included him in its modern american	artists series and had photographed him at his studio in	the east sixties; the corner of it you could see in the photograph	looked as though it ought to have velasquez in it painting the royalty	of spain.	4.690986484935413
16469. i had a long talk with him.	7.048128497340623
16470. we went into mrs	monmouth's library which had low bookshelves all along the walls	and above them a modigliani portrait a jackson pollock twelve feet	long and a gorgeous miro with a yellow background that looked like	an inscription from a martian tomb.	4.426860170120762
16471. the fireplace had tiles made	for mrs monmouth by picasso himself.	3.873635296338494
16472. like certain expensive restaurants	just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself.	6.139079561979864
16473. in the course of our talk askington mentioned that he	spent part of each week studying.	4.572253160081524
16474. no	i take classes with different people he said.	6.412214371980113
16475. i don't	think i've reached the point yet where i can say i know everything	i ought to know about the craft.	3.924838483248162
16476. besides it's important to the	way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere an	atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters as du^rer	went to italy to meet bellini and mantegna.	5.047957166924472
16477. he made	a circle with his thumb and fingers.	4.862373123883983
16478. painting isn't this big	you know.	7.712079578137997
16479. it doesn't embrace only the artist alone before his easel.	4.834770518737059
16480. it is as large as all of art interdependent varied multitudinous.	7.20544579238586
16481. he threw his arms wide his face shining.	5.122200760948306
16482. the artist is like	a fragment of a mosaic- no he is more than that a virtuoso performer	in some vast philharmonic.	5.834325402381386
16483. one of these days i'm going to organize	a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being	painted these days from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism	and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists	have in common with each other.	3.7060803119090417
16484. the eye is all inward or outward.	6.106738434457758
16485. ah what a title for the exhibition: the eye is all!	what do you study?	4.10673821763806
16486.  i asked.	13.29281579470557
16487. i was fascinated; just listening	to him made me feel intelligent.	5.066670852460435
16488. i'm studying anatomy	with burns he replied.	7.163184125958424
16489. he teaches at	the manhattan school of art.	5.131969917669621
16490. i had studied with burns	ten years before during the scholarship year the manhattan gave me	along with the five-hundred-dollar prize for my paintings of bums on	hudson street.	4.987544428905981
16491. burns and i had not loved each other.	5.109713678832788
16492. i'm also	studying enameling with hajime iijima he went on and twice	a week i go to a life class taught by pendleton.	5.340274850869917
16493. my god is he still alive?	5.943344637889937
16494.  he must	be a million years old.	7.5139871259533155
16495. i went to a retrospective of his work when	i was eighteen and i thought he was a contemporary of cezanne's.	4.567141114801009
16496. he's about sixty	now.	9.52328749892442
16497. still painting still a kind of modern impressionist beautiful	canvases of mountains and farms.	5.014024671772291
16498. he even makes the city look like	one of thoreau's hangouts.	6.130331029301074
16499. i've always admired him and when i	heard he was taking a few pupils i went to him and joined his class.	3.878343757963183
16500. yes it sounds great i said but suppose you	don't think of yourself as an impressionist painter?	5.583209299607796
16501.    you're	missing the point he said.	5.619635421798327
16502. he has the magical eye.	10.889774095100087
16503. and	he is a great man.	7.1075368808383175
16504. contact with him is stimulating.	7.712079578137997
16505. and that's	the trouble with so many artists today.	5.0007819096388655
16506. they	sit	alone in their rooms and try to paint and only succeed in isolating	themselves still farther from life.	5.1968046703193425
16507. that's one of the reasons art	is becoming a useless occupation.	5.720930186596874
16508. in the middle ages in the renaissance	right up to the early nineteenth century the painter was a giant	in the world.	6.223749517537813
16509. he was an artisan a man who studied his trade and	developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did.	4.259167599844755
16510. he filled a real need showing society what it looked like turning	it inside out portraying its wars and its leaders its ugliness and its	beauties reflecting its profound religious impulses.	4.711815873138073
16511. he was a propagandist-	they weren't afraid of the word then- satirist nature	lover philosopher scientist what you will a member of every party	and of no party.	4.365215907802772
16512. but look at us today! we hold safe little jobs	illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels	and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out	of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity.	4.673292071117693
16513. a bunch	of amateur dervishes! what we need is to get back to the group to	learning and apprenticeship to the cafe and the school.	4.261790274561849
16514. the upshot of the evening was that i got the	address of pendleton's studio- or rather of the studio in which	he gave his classes for he didn't work there himself- and joined	the life class which met every tuesday and thursday from ten to twelve	in the morning.	4.245713867924658
16515. it was an awkward hour but i didn't have to	punch any time clock and it only meant that sometimes i had to stay	a	couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job.	3.510965148697633
16516. after	a short time both george and donald joined the class with me so they	wouldn't feel lonely and we used to hang a sign on the door of the	brush-off reading out to work.	4.602695592754599
16517. it was mostly for the benefit of	the mailman because hardly anybody else ever visited us.	4.314671126303824
16518. in	a way askington was right.	8.296164919494997
16519. stimulating was the word for it.	5.473854246759054
16520. i don't know that it was always as rewarding as i had expected it	to be.	6.464771096363221
16521. partly it was because pendleton himself wasn't what i anticipated.	4.317068102383446
16522. i had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic	and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars.	5.884216348573083
16523. no that isn't quite fair.	6.549083679307419
16524. actually there was a lot	of force in him which is why i kept on in that class instead of quitting	after a week.	5.531321397473933
16525. such a little thing to start with- the car registration.	5.109448432700109
16526. ida where is the car license?	7.163184125958424
16527.  she asked.	9.848420478905924
16528. i can't	find it in the glove compartment.	8.994094682098062
16529. via must have it	i answered readily enough recalling her last visit.	4.182602481535312
16530. why should via have it?	10.13318311525425
16531.    had	she forgotten she had signed the car away that whatever they mutually	owned had been divided among the children?	3.632711015013689
16532.    i was silent.	13.117602908449625
16533. i	didn't want to stir things up.	5.219666477665999
16534. i drive my own car by courtesy	of via?	6.9995046480612055
16535.    i'm sure she'd turn it over to you	if you'd rather.	4.317068102383446
16536. she looked as if she were	accusing me of some fraud.	7.124927571120868
16537. she must have taken the registration	when she went to walter's.	5.566997966474239
16538. no	thank you.	11.155741451300253
16539. i want nothing of via's.	6.642593604833705
16540. why should this	suddenly assail her?	10.13318311525425
16541.  walter was giving me checks for my pay the	household bills.	4.355836702155925
16542. had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped	her mind?	6.889738786168923
16543.    what a fool i've been she said quietly.	5.7733596915429795
16544. i knew all this but i paid no attention.	7.271930485814832
16545. i don't even own the	house i'm standing in.	5.100396573550883
16546. i was so sure it was all temporary h that	we would all embrace and then the lawyer would tear up all those things	h   it narrows down down down and finally there is no	way out.	4.892712017577034
16547. if i am not to be mrs salter i am nothing.	6.552821934998755
16548. i suppose i should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark	but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge	in.	5.489314074034835
16549. i love you i hate you i feel like killing you and myself	and in the same sequence i love you i think you're the most wonderful	the most noble and so on and on meanwhile eating a good breakfast	and dinner and enjoying living.	3.4157333650977533
16550. so i went about my business.	9.659824382047635
16551. i made	a lemon sponge a light dessert roasted a chicken parboiled some	frozen vegetables so there would be something nice in the icebox for	the weekend.	3.8428958875971255
16552. don't bother ida she said.	7.712079578137997
16553. i have these	appointments in town for saturday and i'll probably spend sunday	with dolly or the thaxters.	4.221687592388223
16554. at last i thought she's	recovering her spirits.	8.528816869001943
16555. with this movie-to-be in london and new faces	about her there she would soon be a more tranquil a wiser person	all the better for her stay out here.	3.620755571495177
16556. i felt more cheerful as if i	had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself.	5.200644189931466
16557. and i went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch	of life.	4.504510982204489
16558. it was foggy that evening but the path to my house was	so well grooved that i could feel my way accustomed as i was to	the dense mists that rise from the sun-warmed palisades of the river	and sometimes last for days.	4.630308193978816
16559. in the morning the fog was still thick	so that to go to the village i crept along with my headlights full on.	4.360531306913252
16560. i did notice a twinkle of light from the big house through the	woods but as i had left a light on in my own house because of the	fog i assumed mrs salter had done the same before she left for	town.	4.490175812438984
16561. i did my shopping had my dentist appointment and from there i	went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed	plans for the annual christmas bazaar so that dusk was beginning to	gather when i drove home in the late afternoon.	3.504937197181235
16562. but the next	day- sunday.	10.40922958104664
16563. why when i drove down to church didn't it speak	to me seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear?	3.979656526870254
16564.  prisoners	brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot	remember and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe	that the mind can remove absent itself unsee.	4.507841974446781
16565. when i came back	from church at noon mrs thaxter was turning into the salter driveway.	4.49938152833499
16566. even at a car's length i could sense that something was wrong	and so i followed her up to the turnaround in front of the house.	5.952998057751409
16567. dolly engisch was waiting there on the steps and she came	running toward us.	4.107080777977768
16568. she's nowhere nowhere! she screamed	and both women ran up to the house and i followed.	6.793556769574368
16569. the	search began in all the rooms running upstairs down opening closets	talking exclaiming in rushes and gasps.	4.128889469911634
16570. everything was as	i had left it the night before last- her portfolio and bag for town	her lingerie and dress and shoes laid out h only her mink coat was	missing.	4.845419399718101
16571. i who until	that day before had been mrs salter's friend her equal was the	servant now.	4.026988402764935
16572. it was dolly and mrs thaxter who were calling via	everybody.	6.583431498527698
16573. and when they spoke they spoke to each other and not	to me.	6.138615438120125
16574. and after i brought them sandwiches and coffee i had to go back	to my place in the kitchen and wait.	6.517227900908683
16575. sitting in the kitchen	i recalled every word mrs salter said that could have been a sign	to me.	4.582074062120023
16576. if i am not to be mrs salter then i am nothing.	8.505127848613384
16577. why didn't that alarm me then?	6.238836969946059
16578.  and when she returned from taking	her guests back to new york she had said all they talked about	was harvie h harvie this harvie that h when they know the	truth will they drop away from me will i become a nothing?	4.762648065478584
16579.  and	then i remembered a few years before after their return from a short	trip to rome i had heard her boast over and over again on the	boat people liked me for myself.	3.6781835905575067
16580. i had made a habit of calling	her at night from my cottage just to check.	6.408819498205206
16581. the last night i	had called but the line was always busy and it reassured me.	3.9882616347896365
16582. i assumed	it was one of those hour-long conversations with dolly or constance	she comfortable in bed.	6.886069432910268
16583. but it seemed not from what they were saying.	5.971704928332614
16584. then was it a final desperate plea from her to whom?	6.2044028944784575
16585.  h hanging	on and on past any man's patience h some final stab of conclusion?	4.216069892129541
16586. 	she was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff.	6.756017390845977
16587. i tried to believe that what must have happened was that restless	disturbed by this telephone call or whatever she walked out in the	night as she had a habit of doing.	3.8888789256164844
16588. sometimes she took the path that	winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff.	5.846093923466518
16589. it's	so romantic up there she used to say with the broad river gleaming	in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of	the night so poetic.	3.5730283916271413
16590. with all that warm rain and the fog it might have	been as simple as a loosened rock a misstep.	5.692768434460718
16591. but i didn't	really think it was as simple as that nor did anyone else.	4.664290446267576
16592. when a	fisherman brought her up in his arms still small as if she were a	child asleep i began to shudder with a terrible excitement almost triumphant	that i still cannot account for.	4.938723040989111
16593. was it a hysterical release	from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks?	4.4750961333096075
16594.  that at last the	vigilance the will gives way?	7.658753296128149
16595.  or what was it that before via	sonny walter and all i began almost to dance with shuddering and	cry out i knew she'd do it! i knew!   everyone stared	at me and drew back.	3.427135992154271
16596. their eyes turned cold and accusing even	via's.	7.431828012474736
16597. and they have never changed.	8.19344623932825
16598. at the same time that	i thought	i understood her at long last and pitied her underneath this knowing	had there burned unquenched by my pity a fire of hate an enduring	envy that burst out in that ghastly outcry?	4.837409698774589
16599.  was that what had given	way in me?	5.60492979016986
16600.  even now i am appalled at how little anyone knows	of what they really are.	5.881450137399343
16601. it is absurd of course to say that that one	exclamation estranged me from the family i considered my very own but	there it hangs a cooling void that broke our close connection with	each other.	3.6798334247314606
16602. at the time i was filled with self-pity at this separation	but in the years since i have come to understand that the sight	of me was painful to them after that outcry.	5.803610387925429
16603. in my person they would	always remember that last long time of me alone with her so if they	told themselves that i could have prevented it i can understand that	by now and love them still because everyone must justify have a scapegoat	for what is not to be borne.	3.4908742328601923
16604. it is not their avoidance	that rankles; it is when i meet someone who was a close friend of	the	family and therefore of mine and they nod to me so coolly and walk	away	that it hurts.	4.8806044559762745
16605. i could tell them but no one ever asked why i had	cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body.	3.9759383914993016
16606. no i forget	mrs mathias who had been away visiting a married daughter when	it happened.	6.483016043508282
16607. she haunted me; she persisted in explaining how and why	she had advised mrs salter to return to the country.	4.271531063407211
16608. we	all feel guilty i turned away from her coldly.	6.365864916097439
16609. she overplayed her hand.	7.116861319551038
16610. what do you mean?	12.609141063623753
16611. 	she frowned.	8.12896173865557
16612. why put such a high value on being top	dog?	7.346112205608928
16613.  i added.	9.686204316035266
16614. it was coarse almost insulting this harsh appraisal	and she has never come to see me since.	5.861351502160333
16615. but suppose she	had not taken mrs mathias' advice and lived on like thousands	of women in towns dispossessed of love hanging on to makeshifts and	altogether and finally arid.	3.429904376289421
16616. if she chose and in that final decision	discarded what above all all of us value life itself must she	not have risen to her fullest height and transcending her murky self	felt at last the passion of a great moral decision?	5.044734927169051
16617.  if they say i	could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks	of self-examination her search into herself and its conclusions.	4.127621360762902
16618. yes i had cried out that i knew she'd do it but without	my fully realizing it at the time it was a cry of triumph for her praise	at her deliverance from pettiness and greed- and guilt.	5.3518974301773055
16619. she was	finally at rest in truth of her own proud free choice.	4.371911722426681
16620. at rest with	my darling ellen the first mrs salter.	7.0360787724007645
16621. the funeral service was in the house the methodist minister	how clean and glistening his eyeglasses and his neat body standing	beside that coffin with that doll inside a stranger speaking to	strangers the old sacred words and the rain drumming incessantly in	accompaniment seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to	mud so the burial had to be postponed.	3.2887554464397475
16622. then via called to	say they had decided to cremate her- as they had ellen the thought	leaped to my mind- and did i want to meet her at the funeral home	the next morning.	5.0196683708620355
16623. the coffin stood on trestles in a corner of	the long low dimly lit funeral parlor on its dark shining surface the	sheaf of white roses i had ordered.	3.286929054251914
16624. i knelt just for decency i	thought at the time but found myself whispering our father which	art in heaven h and it was only after that that something unlocked	in me and i felt a grief.	5.472347707306234
16625. via was in the parking lot when	i went outside.	5.3339265398540645
16626. together we waited in her car until the hearse moved	out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of new jersey.	4.951852241381073
16627. by the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music	was already swelling out into the chapel-like auditorium with its discreet	symbols of religious faiths.	4.298027890172196
16628. again i felt impelled to kneel	and reached back and pulled via down.	6.278330015862287
16629. something would come into her	heart h if nothing else the sounds of bach would give her some healing.	3.889487113867566
16630. i had a rather small place of my own.	8.079616756623274
16631. a nice bachelor apartment in	a place called the lancaster arms.	4.274283303457673
16632. uhhu she said	hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid.	5.988531460989104
16633. and then	i had another place farther downtown i used as a studio.	4.733051610602592
16634. i'm not a man who has many close intimate friends	carla he said wanting her to know all about him.	5.5416907246499285
16635. oh	i'd drink with newspaper people.	5.619635421798327
16636. i think i was what you might call	a convivial man and yet it was when i was alone in my studio doing	my work that i really felt alive.	5.599455179512259
16637. but i think a man needs at least	one intimate friend to communicate with.	4.971615756797691
16638. pausing he waited for	her to turn to ask a question.	6.147133359752317
16639. she showed no interest at all in the	life he had led back home and it hurt him a little.	3.9568473467643415
16640. well what	about you carla?	10.615323932386298
16641.    me?	10.144513917544229
16642.  she asked turning slowly.	10.542164219456446
16643. what about me?	8.648285665039051
16644.    did you make friends easily?	8.849111051933006
16645. 	umm uhhu.	8.12896173865557
16646. somehow i imagine that as you grew	up you were alone a lot.	5.814360634998995
16647. how about it?	9.853428744548971
16648.    i guess so	she said taking a kleenex from her purse.	6.38667026629645
16649. when she had wiped some	of the lipstick from her mouth she stared solemnly at her image in the	mirror.	4.072475397351423
16650. are your people still alive?	10.141003641722882
16651.  he asked trying	to touch a part of her life alberto hadn't discussed; so he	could	have something of her for himself.	4.315505793839817
16652. you talk so well carla	he went on.	8.220963398277965
16653. you seem to have read so much you have a natural gift	for words he added trying to flatter her vanity.	4.615603299436943
16654. you must have	been good at history at school.	8.168610674375744
16655. where did you go to school?	6.2337413162962925
16656. 	what is this?	9.52328749892442
16657.  she asked turning suddenly.	7.681860498173956
16658. don't	you know all about me by this time?	6.412214371980113
16659.  my name's carla caneli.	7.248949544040654
16660. i sleep with you.	9.645886477709713
16661. you know something more about me every	day don't you?	5.605876212736563
16662.  would you be happier if i made up some stories	about my life told you some lies?	5.888261543184644
16663.  why are you trying to worry	me?	6.267050476337843
16664.    i'm not trying to worry you.	7.376089603817626
16665. the cleansing tissues she had been using had	been falling on the floor and he got up and picked up one then another	hoping she would notice what he was doing.	3.563812178678722
16666. at home he had been	a clean orderly man and now he had to hide his annoyance.	6.346638337016228
16667. was she just	naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance?	4.7892254114927
16668.  he	wondered.	13.921774766768346
16669. would he have to clean up after her every day clean the	kitchen the bathroom and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen	floor then hang up her dresses pick up her stockings make the bed	while she lay around?	3.428050707971295
16670.  he straightened up ready to vent his exasperation	then grew afraid.	6.130331029301074
16671. if he dwelt on the indignities he suffered	he would lose all respect for her and without the respect he might lose	his view of her too.	3.7729072504786454
16672. what's the matter?	9.52328749892442
16673.  she asked	suddenly.	9.848420478905924
16674. nothing at all he said quietly.	9.89788382004154
16675. are those the only shoes you have sam?	5.562915607653275
16676. 	what's the matter with them?	7.880959027551708
16677.    the	heavy thick soles.	6.939425769494729
16678. they're an expensive	english shoe for walking around a lot.	6.144814417540349
16679. sam	no one around here wears such heavy soles.	4.6724501027054846
16680. can't you get another	pair?	8.457718703298294
16681.    maybe i could he said surprised that she	could turn from herself and notice anything about him.	4.026008601315269
16682. i'll get	an elegant pair of thin-soled italian shoes tomorrow carla.	5.9245075971793435
16683. and i don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit	she said making a face.	4.839938003521238
16684. what's the matter with it?	7.880959027551708
16685. 	he had put on the gray jacket and the dark-gray slacks and the	fawn-colored shirt he had worn that first night in rome when he had	encountered her on the street.	3.342636566287416
16686. you look like a tweedy	englishman.	10.410376484360091
16687. can't you wear something else and look a little	more as though you belonged?	3.9701983041559052
16688.    i don't mind at all	he said delighted with her attention.	6.38667026629645
16689. changing his clothes he put	on his dark-blue flannel suit and laid away the gray jacket with the	feeling that he might be putting it aside for good.	3.4654039097165463
16690. but it was a hopeful	sign he told himself.	10.786123192537124
16691. she no longer wanted anything about him to	remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in	parioli.	3.8659024113055342
16692. that day they loafed around just getting the feel	of the city.	6.606606162665297
16693. they looked at the ruins of the old roman wall on the lower	via veneto then they went to the farnese gardens.	4.396455036783678
16694. she had some	amusing scandal about the farneses in the old days.	7.489180337923857
16695. then they took	a taxi to trastevere.	6.502956055908496
16696. there's a church you should see she	said.	7.238492384599481
16697. and when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at	santa maria he had to keep a straight face not letting on he had been	there with alberto.	4.171315740031747
16698. he let her tell him all about the church.	6.375016808455901
16699. all evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself.	4.983369207598036
16700. when they got home at midnight she was tired out.	7.181026556916555
16701. and in the morning	when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing.	4.772065414627077
16702. he	had never heard so many bells and as he lay there listening he thought	of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the	obelisk and the church at the top of the spanish steps.	5.195017247689537
16703. it was a good	thing that she clung to her religion he thought.	4.904229193376692
16704. she might like to	take him to st peter's.	7.057872112361533
16705. carla wake up he said	shaking her.	5.219666477665999
16706. aren't you going out to mass?	7.455820258965513
16707. 	you could take me to st peter's.	5.1730154847766965
16708. come on you'll be late.	7.879014094201687
16709. i think	i'll sleep in this morning she said drowsily and as she snuggled	against him he wondered if she ever went to church.	3.6109016184547382
16710. why did he	want her to go to church?	9.429231297027666
16711.  he wondered h probably because it was	a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security.	3.9997494094993096
16712. it would	be good for her.	9.330200655130271
16713. it was too bad he had no feeling himself for church.	5.255343483411137
16714. not his poor mother's fault.	9.4078399278393
16715. she would have been better off	if she had stuck to her bible.	5.259808756709317
16716. as for himself he just didn't have	the temperament for it.	7.119918380805801
16717. from the time he had been at college he had	achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that	there were certain things he could never know.	3.8982519082016998
16718. then he thought of those	old testament figures on the ceiling of the sistine chapel.	6.700501922298201
16719. just	figures out of a tribal folklore.	6.488411313974054
16720. could he honestly believe it would	be good for carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination	now?	5.3875698550159665
16721.  being a woman though she would take only what she needed	from church.	4.571028073388114
16722. it was too bad he wasn't a catholic himself.	7.141487755444666
16723. or a	protestant or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists or a strict orthodox	communist.	5.052692110430769
16724. what was the matter with him that they all wearied	him?	7.5049474676722765
16725.  it was the times he was sure.	6.415010206393233
16726. all the ideologies changing from	day to day right under his eyes so how could a man look to any one	of them for an enlargement of his freedom?	4.987091825668567
16727.  it was all too wearying.	6.989481506090753
16728. but where?	13.042504254880084
16729.  just the same he thought pondering	over it it would be a good thing for a girl like carla if she	got up and went to church.	4.694217658537118
16730. a half hour later he got her up to	go out for breakfast so the ferraros hearing them hurrying down the	stairs would think they were going to a late mass.	4.854705043537205
16731. it seemed to him	that if the ferraros felt sure of them could place them it would	help him to feel more sure of himself with carla.	3.685508415196358
16732. since we're	having coffee with them this afternoon he said i think	i'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean	for us.	4.913379525050855
16733. and he waited for her to say oh no i can do it	sam.	4.868733503445771
16734. there's so little to do.	7.712079578137997
16735. i'm not good at that kind of thing.	4.787809435293479
16736. this afternoon	let's take an air with them.	6.959431700260864
16737. let's be fine superior people of	great dignity he said as if he were joking.	4.517005699123387
16738. if you	find it necessary sam go ahead she said turning on the stair.	5.949338770967432
16739. i am what i am.	7.069582205922005
16740. her words remained with	him worrying him for hours.	7.190804170470829
16741. he didn't know how she would behave with	other people.	4.759395030967646
16742. when they walked into the ferraro apartment	the old lady bowing and smiling said softly.	6.538971043794502
16743. ciao and	put	out her hand.	6.162967476035402
16744. her little brown face wrinkled up her brown eyes gleamed	and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things.	5.148106750546353
16745. agnese	smiling too said 'ello and then more slowly i	am happy.	4.317068102383446
16746. and they sat down and began their little coffee party.	6.935736339946228
16747. the ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee.	4.1174608023645085
16748. acting only as	interpreter carla her hands folded on her lap was utterly impersonal.	5.670014676965839
16749. she would turn to them then turn to him then turn again.	4.502534968224222
16750. watching	her he felt like a spectator at a tennis game with the ball being	bounced back and forth.	5.104256506614838
16751. signora ferraro bobbing her head encouragingly	asked sam about canada having a special interest.	3.9701983041559052
16752. the old woman had a nephew from north italy a poor boy from	a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment and who	had migrated to canada to work on the railway.	4.894581572737645
16753. for a year the boy	had lived in the bush in a boxcar.	6.192134253555725
16754. did many of sam's countrymen live	in boxcars in the bush?	6.474534035524737
16755.  had sam ever lived in a boxcar?	5.719307886173685
16756.  she	wanted to know.	9.52328749892442
16757. regretfully sam explained that he had no experience	with boxcars.	6.238957111601309
16758. just the same the old woman said she would write to her	nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted	country.	5.076086746261878
16759. and sam thanked her and hoped he might meet her nephew	back home and asked her if she had any further news of the pope.	3.666400565825516
16760. a very great pope this one the old woman explained her black	eyes sparkling.	6.088856597418598
16761. it was	said that he had had a vision.	7.306553167274994
16762. just as thousands that day in portugal	had seen the sun dancing in the sky he had seen the same thing later	in his own garden and she turned to agnese for confirmation.	5.056476595991028
16763. agnese	had been sitting quietly listening with the serenity of the unaware.	4.182602481535312
16764. now a little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in	her eyes.	6.116264186788571
16765. the holy father would die soon she said to carla so she	could translate for sam although he had a brilliant doctor a man	who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great	rulers of the world.	3.346684850463356
16766. yes the pope could die and quickly be made a	saint.	6.9060388863774085
16767. no he was indeed a saint now.	6.190841481284727
16768. nodding approvingly and swelling	with importance the old lady whispered confidentially.	5.9245075971793435
16769. there was	a certain discontent among the cardinals.	6.2067239966673995
16770. the pope in the splendor	of his great intellect had neglected them a little.	4.983240996215937
16771. there would be changes	made and signor raymond should understand that when the pope	died it was like the end of a regime in rome.	5.041887082401776
16772. jobs would be lost and	new faces would become prominent.	6.144814417540349
16773. did signor raymond understand?	7.19885334902355
16774. 	indeed he did sam said solemnly trying to get carla's	eye.	5.9245075971793435
16775. surely she could see that these women were her italians too	he thought.	4.40241462316095
16776. devout orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in	brooklyn or malta or ireland.	5.2288514545018705
16777. but carla; eyes were on agnese	whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness.	3.8068118225638226
16778. and carla watching in wonder turned to sam.	6.862798944296332
16779. it means	so much to her.	6.702258878046396
16780. it's like a flame i guess she said in a dreamy	tone.	6.310605892263737
16781. but one night dookiyoon moved in the direction of the women's	lodge where shades of night had gone to purify herself.	4.283457707045757
16782. with	the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill	caressing the flageolet with his lips making it whisper.	4.833359295396946
16783. he saw her	emerge suddenly coming in her unhesitant fashion her back stiff her	head erect facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter	as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass	by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach.	3.1779459309748863
16784. in her dark	scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination afraid of nothing	not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding.	4.982870462497592
16785. seeing her come he caught his breath feeling his heart	bounce in him and turned away afraid now.	3.7088466436124463
16786. even he wanting her	afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit feared the evil presences	in her metabolism more.	5.2023884862514285
16787. his breath caught and trembling he	closed his eyes and stumbled off.	4.475585277002899
16788. going he saw as often before some	queer hideous yellow face over his head shining and weird like the	old images	which had invested him at other times like those that appear	sometimes near the eyeballs when they are perhaps pressed by the thumbs.	4.608150110210041
16789. he cried out to her his back turned.	4.862373123883983
16790. then he fled not	waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry.	6.080759504908049
16791. but	she heard him go.	6.162967476035402
16792. yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly	her neck tall as she looked in his direction and continued on her way	toward the end of the camp.	5.409699765502006
16793. elsewhere others heard and stopped	and waited the women peering from their lodges then gathering in	small curious clusters.	3.685338251241182
16794. early spring came from her bed from beside	her half-drunk husband walitzee and stood at the entrance way to	her lodge hearing the mild commotion the sound of hushed voices.	5.105644470710885
16795. standing	there she saw shades of night come through the trees and stop	beside the lodge silent almost imperious her body taut simply standing	without speaking or moving while the wife of walitzee waited perhaps	denying the dread that moved in her.	3.26417972239638
16796. when at last she could suffer	the insult no longer nor face the girl's scorn she said in a	voice overloud:   i shall call your father! go back where	you can bring no harm or i will go and get the old man from his bed	so he can see your shame!   but the girl said only tell	him i am here that i have come.	4.223060467353953
16797. and it was not pile of clouds	she meant.	8.08913105253283
16798. but now with real anger at last something proud	and indignant early spring stood like a she wolf before her den	and cried i will not shriek at you! i will tell you to go not	begging.	4.776142011113168
16799. telling you! and unsheathing the knife she used for	curing hides she stepped away from the lodge holding the knife at her	side.	3.8226833241511504
16800. you bring only wickedness she said and it was not	to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her	lodge with the cunning hunger of a wild animal.	5.167703376166853
16801. speaking in a low voice	of loathing she went up to the girl who stood with the same upright	scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife.	4.373158861116553
16802. go	take helsq'iyokom your evil spirit to the young boys the	woman said.	6.25351183792155
16803. they do not have to face battle.	9.74818946027487
16804. i will not let your	evil in.	9.220073980347705
16805. i will simply kill you first.	6.366360036956364
16806. now go!   the other	women had come close now their voices murmuring together until they	stood buzzing in an angry knot their threats mingling rising nagging	at each other each trying to make her indignation and anger felt.	4.737831004895638
16807. they picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl.	5.28999283385775
16808. the sticks fell	like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny	points of pain along her thighs.	4.72419470159836
16809. they were all shouting at her as	if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought.	4.3861246015405895
16810. but she did not	move taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme	youth until suddenly pile of clouds came howling among them swinging	a great bullhide whip.	4.790666492761182
16811. go back to your lodges! he	shouted.	5.96440199160872
16812. a pack of dogs makes less noise! he made the long	whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming some	tripping over themselves in their flight.	5.0068545914619325
16813. and early spring seized	the whip and said:   if you must flog someone let it be her	your daughter.	3.9991616241709464
16814. drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay	away from my husband! but the old man turned on her jerking the	whip from her hand.	4.599533526873035
16815. get into your hovel! he spat.	5.774005407559667
16816. go	back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body	among the young women.	5.138210239895059
16817. keep him back if you must tell me what to	do.	4.787949972984694
16818. i will be the one to confront my daughter not the wife of him who	leads her to sin!   she retreated before the naked shame	in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her	lodge where walitzee stirred mumbling sitting up in a half stupor	to say:   what worrisome thing happens?	4.838355650488119
16819.  i thought i	dreamed of wolves fighting.	6.079898371858448
16820. but she went to him and pressed herself	against his nakedness smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had	stolen from tuhulhulzote.	5.909809127752626
16821. she said there is nothing	that concerns you here.	5.97236774018741
16822. lie back and go to sleep.	7.591788496907929
16823. do not let the wicked spirits enter your brain.	5.974568027378381
16824. he sank back	sighing and was soon asleep again.	6.672854314451728
16825. outside the old man	beyond all the curses of the spirits his daughter bore went to her and	twisted the gnarled talons of his fingers in her hair and turned her	and pushed her rudely ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent	out a thousand arms.	3.216625128380518
16826. and shoving her against a spruce her back to	him he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp	air shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound	of it snarled and cracked settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders	while she stood as unchanged as dark and motionless as ever her	eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close	to her face.	4.1267214539038
16827. she said to him her father how was i begotten	in pain or joy?	4.70053897786771
16828.  is it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made	grow on me?	7.233446343980424
16829.  they all know your foolish name!   she stared	at the pale tracings on the tree hearing her breath refracted from	it her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark.	3.492280148007274
16830. she felt the lash bite and heard her father say in crazed monosyllables	words which had no meaning like unnnt! h sssshoo! the	sounds of an animal in rage and despair.	4.794687426659425
16831. suddenly the lash	stopped fighting the air and she heard pile of clouds say in his high	quavering voice:   did you follow me to see my shame?	3.6471789021091605
16832. 	move from the line or i will settle the whip on you h.	5.448482501884564
16833. move! do	you hear the anger of the whip's whine?	4.477601198394805
16834.    turning the	girl saw dookiyoon standing between his narrow shoulders unbent his	arms hanging long and resigned.	5.502137469573621
16835. he said let me take her blows	for there are demons in me too.	4.771466433004527
16836. then without knowing why	she found herself running from them fleeing wildly through the trees	dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky	ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid	listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry.	4.633964726136213
16837. for a while the young men waited outside the lodge of tu	hul hul zote glorying in his harsh language as he talked with himself.	4.061922309220631
16838. he shouted like a hoarse old mastiff his hair stiff and bristling.	5.752586250134144
16839. he ranted and prophesied the doom of his enemies walking in circles	in and out of his living place drinking stolen whisky in great	gasping draughts until finally incoherent and sick he fell into his	own oblivion.	3.5780185929087236
16840. he amused the young men who had been silent long enough.	7.7570266757402075
16841. but they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution	through his antics.	4.724169479327304
16842. now they moved rubbing their flesh alive again	disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them.	5.800002624626504
16843. they	came out and held their games and races.	4.6724501027054846
16844. it was they who held the	future in their hands.	6.883858155724413
16845. they went into the sun together and paraded grandly	in their war clothes painting their faces with the sacred attis	dug far off in the cave of skeletons.	3.7263236926964884
16846. they danced the paxam	wildly at night the war dance and dipped their arrowheads in the venom	of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers firing their	few guns in unison at some indeterminate signal.	4.5100676739162315
16847. walitzee	was among them and sarpsis and they wore red blankets which flew like	broad wings in the air of their passing.	3.9912558537744385
16848. and a very young one swan	necklace tried to emulate them and followed timidly.	6.38534577365207
16849. yellow wolf	was there nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead	in whom also the disordered chemistries of youth worked.	3.5343479183833835
16850. he would spring	bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction because	something had boiled over in his fermenting juices.	5.410168072605921
16851. all the	young men alokut among them challenged them in matched racing.	4.58909686201994
16852. they	raced and maneuvered for war swinging their horses in single file	and then abreast like cavalry.	5.2288514545018705
16853. at times they would ride frenziedly through	the camp letting the women see their courage how handsome they	were in their regalia.	3.9500303676121127
16854. then again they would stand in circles making	other preparations.	6.895683129599377
16855. they combed their hair and streaked it at the part	and greased the bangs so that the hair above their foreheads stood	rigid like the tails of sage hens making love.	3.7463249988542704
16856. walitzee whitened	his leggings with clay knowing the girl watched from her place in	the trees.	5.331440467598945
16857. he saw himself in a superior reflection and he was as a	speeding arrow from the taut bow hurtling with a mad grace his maleness	shining and scented with meadow rue.	3.59140401531853
16858. he was always aware of the women's	eyes which followed him admiring him.	7.128284237881946
16859. and the suspicious envenomed	eyes of pile of clouds.	5.586021152433064
16860. and those of early spring haunted	and now	full of hurt and envy.	6.960666442585433
16861. he felt so much like laughing; even	like shouting and crying out from the hilltops from which he could descend	as an eagle in a mad caper from the cliffs.	3.4507580252520915
16862. he and sarpsis	planned a great parade with the young men.	6.590753475706068
16863. they would give one final	testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance.	4.830207400469338
16864. they would ride with streaming amulets their colors ripening in the	sun shouting the last bellicosity of a nation in the throes of death.	5.465109016049054
16865. and so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was	the young men's blood shifting then into the full heat and outcry	which ran with their hearts.	3.950720125632472
16866. they mounted their horses and rode off	into the hills.	6.999941368099327
16867. the young chief stared at the wall of his	lodge listening.	4.344952398176123
16868. the sound rose on the other side of the hills vanished	and rose again and he could imagine the mad disheveled hoofs of	the appaloosas horses the white men once had called the dogs of hell.	5.20460463250489
16869. he saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across	the ridge.	4.007134404529306
16870. standing then with the others peering into the sun	he saw the bright multicolored legion their hair flying like dark banners	only the thunder the roll of drums the mad cacophony of the	hoofs accompanying them.	4.530306909422839
16871. they leaned into the wind and seemed like one	thousand-legged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose	straight in their saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted ejaculated	their grotesque cry of war.	3.3245215380141513
16872. she was moving through a screen of hemlocks in among the white	birch and maples.	6.389256034515159
16873. the sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her	ears.	3.873609698987832
16874. she stood	once more listening.	9.76679032060516
16875. she had never been here at this	hour.	6.638834096721244
16876. she felt as if some dark totally unfamiliar shape would clutch	at her arm; but she found the path she always used the stubs of branches	she had broken those she had pushed aside; and she walked easily	now and more slowly until she could see the dark glisten of water	beneath her.	4.424920226797343
16877. if i ever committed suicide she thought i	would dive straight down from here- and no one would find me for days.	3.8619234826872924
16878. she smiled and expertly let herself downward holding this known	root or that her sneakers sliding in the leaves.	5.253164313632461
16879. she jumped	out onto the flat expanse of rock and seating herself shook her short-cut	brown hair and tilted her chin far upward.	3.6685058945383573
16880. the reedy music of the	frogs had faded but presently it began again growing in volume until	it was vibrant.	4.653079438027171
16881. julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and clasped	her hands tightly around the bent knees.	3.7834761238632266
16882. she had accomplished a miracle.	10.032982806686238
16883. the hour couldn't change it h.	4.484690356992241
16884. only-	only- her thoughts were a little strange.	7.058477546806914
16885. perhaps it was because it was so late and because she had	no business to be here now.	4.380468273694701
16886. she was thinking of paul a few	weeks ago in the easter holidays with her at one of those awful friday	evening dancing class parties her mother had made her attend.	5.307662900576282
16887. hello julie how are you?	5.619635421798327
16888.  h and then off he went so casually	to someone else with breasts better developed more obvious in a	lower-cut dress someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability	to find words that would hold him.	4.590939643165174
16889. i wish he was with me now she	thought and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once	only pretense and acute embarrassment.	3.630301573769579
16890. oh god! i wish i were	older or younger julia bentley thought.	6.2501113351752045
16891. i wish so much someone loved	me.	6.0473721675076275
16892. george rawlings remembered seeing the door	open sometime during the night- millie in a white robe standing	like a ghost at the threshold.	5.053362471267282
16893. she had vanished; he must have slept	again.	6.093849406833417
16894. he was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him.	6.224836481016446
16895. it seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch; but of course	the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this monday	morning.	4.455866818000727
16896. this room was like a prison.	7.818349325336452
16897. he would not be indebted	to sam! below him as if at the end of some remote tunnel he heard	the humming of a vacuum cleaner.	4.5810629147011985
16898. his fingers fumbled across the bandages.	7.5395536094031375
16899. they had left both of his eyes uncovered h.	5.5781877052447
16900. well he told himself	let's put the show on the road.	7.027258639279378
16901. he was walking across	to the bathroom.	6.211990451438287
16902. he drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with	both hands.	6.333222487780818
16903. a fearful pain had come from his head as if the water	were coursing up through the blood vessels and expanding them h.	3.970006777803243
16904. he	recognized	his jacket and trousers.	8.457718703298294
16905. the fabric was dark; the stains weren't	too apparent; and there were his shoes thank god but his shirt	was one terrible mess.	3.4811835866512224
16906. he shivered and then tore away the	blood-soaked parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf.	5.094863399621238
16907. sam would be amazed to find him gone.	5.198398182940188
16908. millie would have to understand.	9.838490090989524
16909. she must have put his clothes in the closet.	5.178641307628293
16910. he found a lump rising	in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness.	5.457113288175716
16911. he was on	the verge of tears.	6.211990451438287
16912. alex poldowski- in a fashion he owed a debt	to that effete gentleman.	5.640858110419445
16913. at least alex had told him he wasn't dying.	5.501272660422503
16914. perhaps george rawlings would be better off dead.	8.23093860488475
16915. what	time was it?	6.939425769494729
16916.  he peered at his wristwatch.	8.132854117812016
16917. strange it was still running.	6.404189453887438
16918. too early for a vacuum cleaner but probably	sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs.	5.448696829761942
16919. he	was kneeling to tie his shoelaces.	5.280478339612851
16920. his fingers felt absurdly thick	and clumsy.	7.5395536094031375
16921. he rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of	the closet door.	4.088624721032975
16922. this was some freak two	strands of adhesive tape across his nose like ugly roots from the mass	of gauze suddenly moist over his cheekbones.	5.086261809681545
16923. the surface however	was perfectly white.	4.747165061111997
16924. he was drinking another glass of water.	7.8992741135655615
16925. it was after seven o'clock.	6.9294598079161505
16926. he was supposed to be in court this afternoon	at city hall.	8.835977624682284
16927. who would take over?	7.675573639372583
16928.  he'd have to think	but the main thing the imperative necessity was to leave before sam	bentley was up and about and before millie detained him with sympathy.	4.599533526873035
16929. he was actually walking down the	stairs.	6.720510866155086
16930. a plane up in the sky above the clouds and this freakish	wreck of a man desperately trying to get away.	5.628653213684635
16931. father is	that you?	6.939425769494729
16932.  the voice issued from the cavern of the hall below.	5.847509716011089
16933. is that you father?	7.884981118191358
16934.  h who's there?	11.752790813373322
16935. 	for a moment he felt like a thief discovered.	4.477601198394805
16936. then julia	appeared under the arch leading to the dining room.	7.738041691933877
16937. she stood gazing	at him.	7.116861319551038
16938. uncle george!   he was trying to smile	at her.	6.945346011452437
16939. gosh! you shouldn't be up should you?	4.913686410369733
16940. 	i- i was just leaving here julie h.	6.412214371980113
16941. just	about to call a taxi.	5.902025103560178
16942. she was wearing some sort of gray	blazer.	9.121469386387464
16943. she seemed overly tall her brow knitted in concern.	4.892221409626493
16944. well	at least you won't have to do that she was saying.	7.671287260161086
16945. i'm	about to leave myself.	6.162967476035402
16946. you're	leaving?	13.921774766768346
16947.    i'm going back to school she answered.	4.913686410369733
16948. i'm just finishing breakfast h.	7.712079578137997
16949. but	have you told mother you were going?	4.913686410369733
16950.  she asked him.	12.24987093495357
16951. i just don't want anyone disturbed julie.	6.0046664010044415
16952. it's quite a big one he added.	6.743273855772659
16953. her face seemed to	float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight.	4.584184976644379
16954. well won't you	come in then have a cup of coffee- or something?	6.829799904603251
16955.  h or maybe	a drink?	7.408405112551224
16956.  she asked in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated considerate	and yet perhaps partly scornful.	6.645615435854676
16957. he tried to see her face	more clearly.	5.773408965363059
16958. no- nothing at all he said after a moment's	hesitation.	7.066714481349551
16959. i'll just wait for you here.	5.219666477665999
16960. he leaned	his head against the wood paneling behind him but the vivid red	images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids.	4.959234385435765
16961. julia moved past.	6.939425769494729
16962. i have to say good-by upstairs.	10.460276794316698
16963. as a great favor julie he said please	don't mention you've seen me.	4.640671198439431
16964. not to anyone?	13.276525954346402
16965. 	no- please h.	6.939425769494729
16966. i'll call your mother as soon as	i get home.	6.144814417540349
16967. it'll be so much easier.	5.619635421798327
16968. all right h	she was staring at him.	7.644912651241943
16969. please	you just go ahead.	6.162967476035402
16970. he could feel a	pulse pounding against the bandages.	7.586143316236553
16971. he imagined sam's voice: george	what the hell goes on?	4.645344995261077
16972.  i wouldn't have the strength	to answer he thought.	6.9995046480612055
16973. maybe i couldn't have called a taxi.	5.869410504761511
16974. he could hear the footsteps overhead.	8.764390642211252
16975. he saw the suitcase which	julia was holding.	6.063102648565436
16976. i'll take that julie-	for you.	7.712079578137997
16977. i can manage.	9.72151337667092
16978. she went ahead of him.	8.761021559502252
16979. outside the lincoln was parked.	6.4865061438783975
16980. he could	hardly believe he was getting in.	7.285045007229284
16981. pietro was gazing at him in an insolent	disdainful fashion; but that didn't matter.	3.9701983041559052
16982. we'll	drop mr rawlings off in ardmore julia said and for the merest	second george was reminded of her father's tone with servants.	5.243989042621007
16983. to the manner born- odd to have such a thought at a time like this;	yet her inflection seemed forced or rehearsed.	4.219491824170942
16984. he could not stop	to analyze.	10.77661356836242
16985. he had never felt particularly close to her.	6.149944852225799
16986. carrie seemed	more affectionate but obviously julia had respected his request.	5.9245075971793435
16987. i wish i didn't have to go back to school	she said and then i wish you lived in new york.	3.976745681312935
16988. that's	in the opposite direction.	8.457718703298294
16989. i wish i did he responded.	6.0473721675076275
16990. i wish i wasn't wearing this ridiculous costume and that	we could go to a theater together or a nice restaurant forget we	knew h he stopped speaking.	5.013421277582949
16991. forget we ever knew what?	5.619635421798327
16992. 	oh just sort of everything in general.	6.743273855772659
16993. she	said nothing until pietro had slackened their pace.	4.6724501027054846
16994. i know you	feel badly but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say.	6.281074116432612
16995. i'm supposed	to joke about things aren't i?	4.913686410369733
16996.  h but sometimes life	can	be rather a disappointing business.	7.245998133703309
16997. his voice seemed thick	and purposeless.	5.949600585200961
16998. he could see the stone building	where he lived.	8.797351921021974
16999. just a few more steps h.	7.136482866279415
17000. abruptly he reached	into his pocket.	7.712079578137997
17001. yes there was the key.	8.23327926016658
17002. are you positive	you'll be all right by yourself?	7.743975275510416
17003.  she asked him.	8.926231624174129
17004. for a	moment he smiled.	9.628751964760633
17005. you've done me the greatest	possible service.	5.219666477665999
17006. by myself i'll be fine.	8.90601570894112
17007. take care	of yourself then.	7.4707011578607565
17008. you also h.	13.601008412979319
17009. it was an automatic phrase; as he crossed through	the courtyard he regretted it.	4.633325323763127
17010. he should have discovered a more	tender farewell.	7.344804226885587
17011. someone shouted at him well! will you look	at george rawlings! what happened to you?	4.160186855011626
17012.    i bumped	into a door handle george said.	7.419762506052198
17013. george	walked steadily ahead into his entry.	5.219666477665999
17014. his bandages seemed on fire.	8.16490567933018
17015. he had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it.	4.641876812187911
17016. in the kitchenette	the raw whiskey made him gasp.	7.058866214174952
17017. just one or two swallows he	told himself enough to lessen some of the pain.	5.5636399438671935
17018. no millie i'm home h.	8.98760341334402
17019. no really right as rain	h.	6.549083679307419
17020. tell sam not to worry about the car.	7.654288664554021
17021. i'll get it hauled away	h.	5.619635421798327
17022. no please- no visit today- i'll be asleep h.	6.831689567118745
17023. for god's	sake don't worry.	7.016275579192534
17024. that upsets me more than anything h.	7.787532299577984
17025. yes	sure	i'll see the doctor- this evening if you insist h.	4.317068102383446
17026. there was one more call to make.	8.48347240335259
17027. joan did i wake you?	6.02461267607589
17028. 	he asked.	11.155741451300253
17029. yes i thought you'd probably be up h.	5.366173820971269
17030. look	sweetheart	some fool was h.	8.457718703298294
17031. happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated	last night.	5.175233852047642
17032. unfortunately it turned out to be me but i wouldn't	quite put it that way to the boss h.	7.16504613212118
17033. oh hell no i'm not in a	hospital.	5.518635519134088
17034. i won't be in town for a couple of days though and there's	that case i was supposed to handle this afternoon.	6.0099788234191625
17035. too bad a jury	isn't involved.	6.98539108666122
17036. i might struggle in for a jury.	7.803911261835123
17037. but i thought maybe tony elliott could pinch-hit for me.	5.1636335501115465
17038. he'll	understand- you might give him sort of a tactful nudge.	5.9245075971793435
17039. he's	got all the facts.	6.162967476035402
17040. i wouldn't want to ask for a postponement- it's	really just a routine thing h.	5.791474901382629
17041. what?	10.144513917544229
17042.  h no darling i'd	rather	you didn't come out.	7.7091275560625965
17043. a smile pulled at the lower strip of	adhesive tape.	4.43026810195405
17044. i'll see you wednesday.	8.457718703298294
17045. i'll bribe you with a nice- he was about to say double	martini but thought better of it.	3.9822781631571105
17046. i'll take you out to dinner.	7.163184125958424
17047. okay?	10.144513917544229
17048.  h	he had put down the receiver.	7.163184125958424
17049. a strange relationship	between joan fulbright and himself.	4.852263872861348
17050. who knew about it?	10.550898744788524
17051. 	she lived alone in the older part of the city in one of those renovated	houses whose brick facade some early settler had constructed.	5.055495173281953
17052. she	had two tiny rooms on the second floor.	7.622859508695107
17053. she was a clever girl a most	efficient secretary.	6.290528861986476
17054. she let him come and go as he pleased or as	it pleased her.	5.99656137357177
17055. in the office you might have thought them only casual	friends; yet	if he said: make an excuse yourself come out here today	she would have been on the next train- and similarly if she had	been in need he would have gone to her.	3.710044170897658
17056. they make us conformists look good.	8.158139953228307
17057. that's a peculiar	way to think.	5.734309428527627
17058. it wasn't just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled	her own feathers of course; she knew that.	5.562150632439454
17059. it was jim's little	sister myra the unreliable irresponsible forever flyaway	myra.	4.7972125379755886
17060. she's a year older than i am lucy told herself.	5.9245075971793435
17061. come come jim said jollying lucy a little.	4.74905804432209
17062. susan ready?	12.374203610038418
17063.    lucy listened.	9.548394429163393
17064. upstairs busy feet showering like raindrops pattered around her	room.	6.144814417540349
17065. susan would be visiting her grandmother for only a few days but	even at seven she was a prudent soul; she always packed for a lifetime	just in case.	4.113961015437237
17066. every doll in the house must be going	with her.	8.012362358739592
17067. she'd better step on it.	5.619635421798327
17068. it's a long way	to websterville.	8.411372774924624
17069. jim's fine young face was an expressive one	too; as he looked at her it registered anxiety.	3.744109221929566
17070. myra wanted me to thank you for taking cathy.	6.879270661569956
17071. it'll be	only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in paris-	but even so she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful.	3.9544792493436445
17072. lucy did not believe him; myra appreciated nothing.	7.23253711172403
17073. jim had	put the thanks in his sister's mouth.	5.045371311787228
17074. darling- she	said and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend.	5.331440467598945
17075. she should have told me herself.	5.856547304788402
17076. and will it be only a	couple of weeks?	7.151476574371707
17077.  remember what happened the last time?	5.767666806372097
17078. 	leaving cathy with them myra had gone out to the coast for a supposedly	brief visit; but she had stayed all winter and cathy had stayed	all winter too- with them.	4.786354999878369
17079. lucy suspected that myra would never	have come home if gregg myra's husband hadn't gone out to	fetch her.	3.8587570181819126
17080. that was an awfully long two weeks.	8.60330339261072
17081. for	an otherwise silent moment jim's keys jingled nervously in his	pocket.	4.317068102383446
17082. but she promised- this will be different he said	at last.	7.4923567747961215
17083. you've got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine	government job over there- she'll get a home for herself and cathy	in no time.	3.489638363063594
17084. you'll see myra's settling down.	7.712079578137997
17085. on the defensive	he added i wish you'd think what it must be like for her	to be without greg to be a new widow a young widow.	4.2992846912809375
17086. it	depends on the widow.	8.457718703298294
17087. lucy had an idea that myra loved it.	5.063983802355171
17088. and	not for one moment did she believe that myra had settled down.	5.620115935004308
17089. it	seemed to lucy that all their married life she and jim had been doing	nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her	way of life.	3.3277242066172517
17090. remembering that succession of disasters she now considered	cathy an ominous child-cloud on her horizon.	5.365113311284917
17091. it was	not that she disliked cathy.	6.294319944051856
17092. the youngster drew her troubled her depths;	whenever lucy saw her she tried without noise or fuss to give	her the warmth she had never had from myra.	4.3991626374458885
17093. but cathy was myra's	responsibility not hers.	5.7327140783480806
17094. i wouldn't even be surprised	she said unhappily if myra tried to leave her with us forever.	5.534244643663305
17095. myra loved big cities; thousands of miles away- in paris	of all places- she might forget she had ever been a mother.	3.562986165219297
17096. lucy	knew her too well to find it impossible.	6.412214371980113
17097. that's a horrible	thing to accuse her of! jim was so indignant it was obvious that	no matter what he said he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-cathy.	3.6840171145556595
17098. he went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up fiercely	susan! susan! get moving!   a startled piping	sound returned.	6.363303594684387
17099. don't yell at us lucy said.	5.219666477665999
17100. was	it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front	of the house looking at the moon-washed river?	6.050628237753283
17101.  their arms around	each other they had been talking of the present and the future;	their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm as steeped in	light as the air around them.	3.74535062803031
17102. then from within the still sleeping	house the telephone had rung; myra with her news was on the other	end of the line.	5.516799340095201
17103. jim turned back from the stairway and looked	at her.	5.017993475441785
17104. his dark brows which had been lowered in anger smoothed.	6.908203720216691
17105. there isn't a chance of myra's letting	anything like that happen.	5.528786082235917
17106. but they	weren't just friends lucy thought; they were husband and wife	and myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage.	5.055085043213138
17107. the only	thing that had ever come between them was that worthless selfish sister	of his.	3.570845587849075
17108. lucy was sick of it.	8.766137561223777
17109. well at last she said	because susan was clattering down the stairs.	4.720125873951003
17110. susan	looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse; her arms were straining with	a burden of dolls.	5.331440467598945
17111. do you	need that big bundle?	7.1850342678031
17112.  jim said.	13.007545772795085
17113. his voice had sharp edges as	though he knew very well lucy and he were not friends at the moment.	3.666265512281535
17114. all that junk?	12.532418222073167
17115.    susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes	that gushed an instant grief; to her each of her dolls was a real	person with a living heart.	3.450497960641798
17116. now now lucy said approaching	susan with a handkerchief mopping skillfully.	6.563548970557644
17117. your father	didn't mean it susan.	6.568815526344989
17118. she gave jim a quick shape-up look of	warning.	7.544179847083111
17119. he'll take every one of them.	6.146983012397281
17120. jim groaned	but he lifted susan's suitcase and said in a gentler tone sure-	the entire thousand.	5.9151273733380885
17121. and when you get back from grandma's cathy	will be here to play with you.	4.365900757664067
17122. nice?	13.921774766768346
17123.    no susan	said grappling with her outsized armload of dolls with a scrooge-like	effect.	4.434174646570211
17124. and at this point lucy thought there should be	a lecture on little cousins' sharing dolls- but she could sympathize	with susan; there ought to be a limit to sharing too.	5.8894342243747815
17125. that was one more reason she didn't look forward to cathy's visit	short or long; the last one had been a lilliputian war.	4.506124459427811
17126. she suspected	that cathy had been competing with susan for attention that she	had never had.	5.6835767868554585
17127. well jim said out of the silence let's	get going dolls and all.	5.388161327014436
17128. when the car with susan's	hands waving wildly from the rear window disappeared down the	driveway lucy stood looking after its pale dust.	5.213127886866269
17129. the day was brilliant	around her- flower-scented crisp with breeze- yet her inner turmoil	darkened it.	3.81137419712738
17130. she had let jim go with a chilly good-by a chillier	kiss.	6.721482793309034
17131. she was sorry and angry at herself because never in their	life together had she done that.	4.179800720366185
17132. she turned and began to walk toward	the house.	7.9729791374095464
17133. at the feeding station the raffish group of cowbirds	again bobbed and gobbled over the ground but now gorgeous among	them was a beautiful red cardinal radiant in its feathered vestments.	3.512665216950905
17134. the handsome bird was solitary; its mate must be at home silently	guarding their nest.	4.900432726990401
17135. she had better stay there lucy thought; the	sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels.	4.124716848160591
17136. well lucy?	15.103298062679784
17137.  she said to herself abandoning the cardinals	and the cowbirds.	5.333113628338628
17138. she had a day of things to do; among them she	had to prepare the guest room.	6.526923079310465
17139. how long would it be occupied?	6.6357352544371855
17140.  she	wondered with a baffled feeling of helplessness.	6.743273855772659
17141. as long as the unscrupulous	myra chose?	8.055575618828072
17142.  for a moment her mind returned again to the	strange flying world of birds and she said to herself.	5.9411359558498456
17143. it isn't	only birds that dump their children in other people's nests h.	4.492216360467276
17144. in the sunshine of late afternoon lucy stood looking at the ready	guest room.	6.032311265806793
17145. there were new yellow curtains bright as a child's	life ought to be a new bedspread lively with hopping rabbits and hanging	from the ceiling was an airy mother goose mobile spinning slowly	in the breeze.	3.9382483557572017
17146. a row of little hangers waited for a child's clothes	in the neatly empty closet; since myra had always put most of	greg's money on her own back lucy suspected that no more than a	few of that long row would be needed.	4.622218203195593
17147. the closet was faintly fragrant	with lavender and as lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into	her mind like a lavender ghost: greg's house on the day he	was buried and the child pale silent baffled watching the funeral	guests with panicky eyes.	3.0098232125972166
17148. many times since his death that memory had	worried and troubled her.	6.381701215286567
17149. out in the hall the upstairs phone	shrilled and the small ghost vanished.	5.22393171338134
17150. when she picked up the receiver	her mother's cheerful voice was there.	7.6960514341478845
17151. websterville	junction calling she said.	6.162967476035402
17152. i just thought i'd let you know.	8.240474986168884
17153. myra dropped cathy this morning and jim picked cathy up and left	susan a few hours ago.	4.019130602866699
17154. i'd have phoned sooner but i've been	busy.	6.743273855772659
17155. i can imagine! susan was an active character;	for mother to be able to call susan must be napping now surrounded	by her multitude of dolls.	4.068782160343182
17156. lucy drew out the chair and sat down;	she relaxed a little and some of the tension went out of her.	6.238870417838649
17157. you	could think yourself as grown up as methuselah yet the maternal voice	still kept its comforting magic.	3.744109221929566
17158. but myra was the merriest widow i ever saw.	6.60434795749222
17159. on	her way to the airport on her way to paris- you bet lucy said	to herself.	4.378361889564328
17160. i've been fixing up the guest room for cathy.	6.266277551462564
17161. there was a momentary pause and then her mother said how long	is she supposed to stay?	4.530570701607812
17162.    just for a couple of weeks	till myra finds a place for them.	7.731475262995723
17163. well- this time	there was a long silence while the telephone hummed faintly with	a voiceless life.	4.043974526423704
17164. puzzled lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper;	her mother was forthright; she was not usually given to mysterious	silences.	5.1947471344429825
17165. was she thinking along the same lines lucy was- that	it was quite possible cathy might be left with her for good?	3.7130639779365193
17166.  you	mean once myra gets to paris?	7.163184125958424
17167.  once the soft pretty moth	found the bright light she had always wanted?	4.745002804333456
17168.    suddenly seekingly	lucy asked mother do you know something i don't know?	6.261073297544813
17169. 	again there was that curious pause and then her mother	said i guess i do.	3.8849121559715263
17170. just before myra left- she was saying good-by	to cathy and she didn't realize i was near.	5.840339212883285
17171. she hesitated	as though hunting over words and ways of putting them.	4.676531986942927
17172. cathy was	in tears of course and i heard myra say 'now be good and at	christmastime i'll send you a wonderful present from paris'.	4.714137561967006
17173. shocked speechless lucy sat there.	5.619635421798327
17174. then she jumped to her	feet the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake.	5.899836506385952
17175. christmastime!	then it was no bogey she had dreamed up; it was	only too true.	4.091032138277367
17176. myra had no intention whatever of sending for cathy in	two weeks.	5.86744938206948
17177. for a moment anger darkened the hallway about her	and when she found her voice anger thickened it.	4.428738403699822
17178. that does it!	she said.	10.306098020755595
17179. i'll keep cathy for two weeks.	5.219666477665999
17180. then if myra	does nothing about fetching her i'll pack her right back to her mother-	if i have to take her myself! her hand tightened on the	receiver.	5.529780957911425
17181. and that's what i'm going to tell jim.	5.0007819096388655
17182. for	lucy the day's nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end.	6.167407278693608
17183. as she hung up she saw through the hall's open window the purple-black	flying of the cowbirds' wings and heard their grotesque singing.	3.8165111388350597
17184. cowbird myra! she's not going to get away with it.	7.169529426347855
17185. cathy is tired lucy thought watching them come slowly up the	path.	4.182602481535312
17186. the child's thin legs were plodding.	6.154713990487742
17187. she trudged along slowly	both hands clutching a tired teddy bear.	4.687080376675738
17188. she was at the moment just	a small walking package being delivered to her aunt's and uncle's	house.	6.937209667602949
17189. unlike susan she was traveling light; the worn teddy	bear a tiny suitcase that jim carried and the clothes she wore were	all she had.	3.5935490406327975
17190. lucy glancing at the miniature case knew there would	not be enough in it for the shortest of stays; they would have	to buy things for her.	5.134028691171716
17191. unimpressed the dog plopped on the sand.	4.913686410369733
17192. quint couldn't blame	maggie for disbelieving.	7.712079578137997
17193. for eleven days they'd done the same	thing leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast before esperanza	beach got jammed with tourists and beach balls and show-offy lifeguards.	3.500283297482827
17194. the swirling sand made quint's limp more pronounced.	5.650577481330174
17195. they walked	slowly past the sherbet-colored cottages- eleven lemon nine mint	seven orange- around the curve to a deserted stand with an eats	sign jiggling in the wind.	3.4745875982297107
17196. now they were in friendly territory.	11.058109891864303
17197. nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping	jaggedly to the water's edge.	4.300969901448467
17198. his rock was to the right of a	v-shaped inlet a big brown lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers.	6.175169573974236
17199. his rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here.	4.220828983869576
17200. here he was enclosed and safe.	8.87360374133939
17201. along didn't he have a red swiss hunting knife on his belt- ten	here was a perfect place to lie	down and make believe.	3.663409212897959
17202. he was canute controlling the waves.	8.524995147246532
17203. he was	a knight of the round table sir quintus the brave slaying	evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses.	3.5696403308589835
17204. he	was the first astronaut on the moon chosen because of his small size	and intrepid nature.	5.778750471345333
17205. he was six feet one like his father with big	hands and a hairy chest a man the weak and persecuted would turn to.	3.685299413093321
17206. every night when he wanted a drink of water didn't he practice	being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light?	5.1486563171866235
17207.  a dark	bathroom can be pretty scary and he'd creep back to bed proud of	himself thinking: tomorrow for sure i'll go down to the rock	and keep my promise to dad.	3.4647561105507982
17208. he hadn't intended to make the	promise.	7.5139871259533155
17209. it happened two weeks ago the night before his father left	on a business trip to south america.	4.423729083131366
17210. every piece of the nightmare was	clear in place; and when he woke up his father was saying stop	screaming quint.	5.497767486643355
17211. he	could remember the feel of his father's big hands the thump of his	father's heart sending out signals- regular like radar.	3.759767973304626
17212. let's	talk about the beach.	8.457718703298294
17213. while i'm gone you get brown and	fat as a pig hear?	4.5882165605478455
17214.  look i can put two fingers between the cords	in the back of your neck.	6.386768141769707
17215. dr fortman says swimming would help your	leg.	5.666916850055303
17216. he says you're limping more than you need to.	7.7426585658923734
17217. how	does he know?	6.939425769494729
17218.  big dumb nut.	9.52328749892442
17219. in	the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the	promise spilled out.	4.091613497921674
17220. when you get back i'll	probly be swimming better than victoria.	7.215351543242658
17221. victoria was fourteen months younger than quint a head taller	and could lick any boy or girl on the beach.	3.6116224530611394
17222. she called him stuck-up- that's why nobody plays with	you mister stuck-up.	6.197871288603115
17223. or what was worse she prayed for him out	loud at bedtime: please lord gord please give my brother the	strength to go swimming like he promised.	3.5679491114370405
17224. quint said now to the clouds.	7.582101443435585
17225. strength began to zip	up and down his chest.	4.6724501027054846
17226. he felt strong as a giant.	8.21997315563278
17227. he unlaced his high	brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg.	3.9894859797279003
17228. he wadded his	sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks.	5.602069740141308
17229. goolick goooolick creaked a sea gull.	5.219666477665999
17230. aw shut	up he said.	8.457718703298294
17231. he stood on the rock a skinny dignified boy	surrounded by the ocean.	4.596387327968072
17232. the wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades	and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing	each other he could see his head down there bleeding wedged between	the rocks and the waves.	4.306663977702253
17233. i'm scared	of the nightmare.	6.162967476035402
17234. shivering he put on his clothes.	7.5578041228019135
17235. and shivering	with shame he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat	into the water.	4.449135757622418
17236. watch it big shot a hoarse voice yelled	back.	6.795869023138136
17237. she was holding on to his rock with one hand.	5.052248573770243
17238. she wore a bathing suit like his mother's no straps	on the shouders.	6.339792435153082
17239. why didn't you duck?	7.70222107681634
17240.  he snapped.	12.081077223713681
17241. is.	10.144513917544229
17242. she was sore as a boil.	8.92730245649156

17246.    i'm mark gordon peters	the fifth.	7.712079578137997
17247. then why don't	you stop squinting?	6.645016358310672
17248.    i said quint.	11.047745478273832
17249. quintus in latin means-   i can speak both	kinds of latin smart aleck.	4.0683852436856025
17250. her cough sounded like cloth ripping.	8.219197736138074
17251. you shouldn't smoke so much he said unconsciously	imitating victoria's holier-than-thou voice.	4.836724270252184
17252. she was horrified.	13.043030680724906
17253. not having said hell before he stumbled a bit before gathering	momentum.	4.711460279008516
17254. sometimes eleven fourteen a day.	9.11081105383013
17255. if i	was your mama i'd wop your tail off.	5.023313515610302
17256. my mother never	wops me.	10.50444776112
17257. i've got this leg brace.	5.619635421798327
17258. she seemed so unimpressed	that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see	his brace.	5.362696577508865
17259. dingy-looking was what she said.	5.619635421798327
17260. why don't	you paint it red and white like a barber pole?	6.678272204147102
17261.    because	maybe i won't have to wear it always.	5.059435176896747
17262. dr fortman says if	i exercise my leg more maybe i can use a cane when i'm big.	5.449857734769117
17263. she spouted a mouthful of water into the air.	4.892221409626493
17264. someone's walking past you want to stop him zoooop	snag him around the neck with the crook in your cane.	5.65078340807602

17285. her name was sabella and the strip of seaweed around her neck	was an emerald necklace the king gave her as a token of his undying	love.	3.5410260524182195

17298. she made better	pictures than any book he'd read but he didn't say so.	5.830243309177054
17299. artfully	as the days went by he found occasion to tell her that his father had	won the navy cross in the korean war; that his baby sister could	spit up through her nose when she felt like it; that he personally	had an iq of 141 and was currently reading the mushr to ozon	volume of the encyclopedia.	3.019909275587627

17309.    he hadn't.	8.80323508231408
17310. but it	was such a nice thought that he nodded his head.	6.162488553530976
17311. either that or	a veterinarian.	7.426210348890434
17312. better make up your mind son sabella	said.	7.619512563519903
17313. you can't serve cod and salmon.	6.490824436842797
17314. she said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward.	6.990197279408519
17315. his	encylopedia agreed with sabella.	6.162967476035402
17316. next morning he tied a bunch of	sea daisies with string and threw them across the v-shaped inlet to	the rock where she was swimming around.	4.987935209127905
17317. boy could she catch! like	willie mays in the outfield.	4.477601198394805
17318. nobody gave me flowers before.	9.026970118224352
17319. her face turned pink with pleasure and a	smothered cough.	4.977215225893091
17320. you can always tell a real gentleman- they got	a certain je ne say quok.	6.0868849901655615
17321. sometimes they didn't talk	at all.	6.903199779196682
17322. he daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around.	5.925879823256658
17323. once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered don't	feel like it he was tempted to tell her about being scared.	3.800570853264868
17324. but victoria began yodeling just then and he went home carrying	sabella in the back of his head not thinking about her just knowing	she was there smiling smelling of peppermints.	5.1919066095736515
17325. as for his promise-	oh he had plenty of time buckets of time.	5.120874005667268
17326. they were eating breakfast.	10.724583529474003
17327. we beseech thee lord	gord to bless this food- that was victoria saying grace while	the baby sprayed raisin toast on her plastic bib.	3.636338709494426
17328. same old breakfast	till the phone rang making his mother's voice shake with excitement.	5.448482501884564
17329. your daddy's in san francisco she told	them.	6.293202654259976
17330. he says he'll be here on the one-o'clock plane.	8.027884190382267
17331. fifteen	days early- isn't that wonderful?	5.619635421798327
17332.    yeah keen.	11.155741451300253
17333. a cave seemed to be opening in quint's stomach.	5.2992528961004375
17334. children	we'll have to get organized.	8.591457210075488
17335. the baby can have an early nap.	4.2805176720881475
17336. victoria	i want you to h   quint closed the screen door	quietly so maggie wouldn't	be scared.	5.499362729237842
17337. hurry up we're late he	said noticing with a chill how gray the sky was this morning the fog	like a rope along the horizon the choppy waves sending off sheets of	blue and kool-aid green.	3.230360902436945
17338. the cave in his stomach hurt.	6.154713990487742
17339. he	had to go into the water.	5.436331026986172
17340. he'd tell sabella about the nightmare.	7.163184125958424
17341. it	had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung.	6.678797305723428
17342. what caused	it he didn't know.	9.152339195294
17343. the metal collar gagging his neck?	4.484773325250435
17344.  sweating	so much?	11.155741451300253
17345.  the unbearable weight on his chest?	4.484814815711922
17346.  all of it together	meant drowning.	12.177234278744562
17347. the first time the nurse took him out of the lung she	said if he got frightened she'd put him back for a second.	4.339704101602624
17348. when bobbie evans smashed up his car the jaguar his wife linda	had given him for his last birthday and himself quite thoroughly	with it driving back from an afternoon's golf at oakmont it seemed	to mark the end of a long miswritten chapter in the social life of	the community.	4.748983199287377
17349. linda looked remote yet lovely in black and everyone	held his or her breath.	4.044752793458228
17350. not that linda was heartless not that	she would do anything prematurely or in bad taste any more than john	cooper would.	5.839064828859222
17351. hadn't linda been a perfect wife to bobbie who	was the least bit of a disappointment all these years?	3.632711015013689
17352.    wasn't	john cooper even more attractive at forty-seven than he had been	twenty-five years earlier?	5.448482501884564
17353.  and wasn't john's wife edythe	even more appalling if possible?	4.767272111599635
17354.  didn't john cooper after all	this time deserve something better of life?	5.739974350684024
17355.  wasn't it adult and	realistic to look at it that way?	5.286242518164919
17356.  and romantic?	12.77864853970905
17357.    everybody	knew that john cooper had married edythe on the rebound.	4.317068102383446
17358. it was	the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life and it was a tribute	to john's strength of character and very real business ability that	it hadn't ruined his.	5.434981718304586
17359. of course there was nothing you could	do but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen	mousie chandler said to linda stuart.	4.049463770433516
17360. poor john! linda	accepted the reproach which was something she did rarely in all	her life and most rarely in that summer of 1936 when she was by all odds	the prettiest and brightest young woman west of the allegheny mountains	and john was surely one of the handsomer and brighter young	men around pittsburgh.	4.712504886035913
17361. for it had been john and linda ever	since she had come out two seasons before at the golf club to the goggle-eyed	admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow	debs.	3.772680319332283
17362. john had claimed her from the stag line a young man a year out	of dartmouth with skiing crinkles still around his eyes.	5.373496783542377
17363. you	saw them always together those years.	5.219666477665999
17364. you talked about john-and-linda	as an entity.	8.907651622822808
17365. john-and-linda were at longue vue last night;	john-and-linda drove to conneaut in three and a half hours.	4.291968145804825
17366. then there	was a spat over something as there had been lovers' spats before;	only this one didn't heal.	5.806346252739519
17367. you still said john-and-linda	but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such	as the depression or dillinger.	4.040445150313698
17368. it got worse instead of better.	8.5387140347251
17369. first	it came out after mr cooper's will was settled- he had died	the year before- that john and his mother weren't rich any more.	3.4350960928305088
17370. and then there was linda's engagement to bobbie evans.	8.354866404003316
17371. there was no connection between the two events because bobbie wasn't	rich either though he was more aggressive than john.	4.603919906931184
17372. he was	a bright and handsome young man from new york who worked for the same	steel company as john did.	5.451317732129755
17373. some people said linda had just	announced the engagement to jolt john into some action but when john	came home from a business trip to cleveland with edythe with edythe	his bride it could no longer be john-and-linda even to sentimental	wishful thinkers.	3.540849369275724
17374. it wasn't even john and edythe.	8.39397876591202
17375. it was simply	poor john.	7.412078007831449
17376. there was nothing specifically wrong with edythe	but there was absolutely nothing right about her either.	6.112192434557145
17377. mousie	chandler had been to school with her someplace near baltimore and	tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at horne's.	3.6328814703717645
17378. well you shouldn't underestimate edythe	mousie said.	8.591126747194702
17379. i know she gives the impression of being shallow and	frivolous and scatterbrained.	5.032587256852465
17380. she is frivolous and scatterbrained but	she really isn't shallowh.	7.454571290411955
17381. bobbie and linda looked	magnificent at their wedding.	4.913686410369733
17382. john was at the church with edythe.	11.175455014697215
17383. she	giggled during the ceremony and mousie chandler who was one of	linda's bridesmaids said john glared black as death at her.	3.6288594899593702
17384. as	if he were choking she said.	7.163184125958424
17385. poor john!   edythe	settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example.	4.549181951634781
17386. her hair	never seemed to be in place and her skirts were never quite the correct	length.	7.303266035250117
17387. she didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the	pool at longue vue but her bathing suits were far from smart.	3.7708130271360365
17388. and	you didn't see her much at longue vue or anywhere for john had drifted	away from the gang.	5.057556181613073
17389. mousie said it was because he was too proud	to stand pity.	4.981591381333076
17390. others thought he couldn't stand seeing linda mrs	bobbie evans still so beautiful so much in command of everything.	5.484810535819058
17391. there were less-dramatic reasons too.	7.393277470749698
17392. john's mother	died not long after his marriage and there was even less cooper money	left.	5.92854359014254
17393. john sold the big old place in sewickley and bought a smaller	house in fox chapel.	4.1093361448829775
17394. he was not reduced to poverty but his job	at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing	the day.	5.789514702582163
17395. john was good at his job.	6.025836322458627
17396. it probably wasn't hard	for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing but edythe	to come home to.	5.74896934684613
17397. though that may be unfair since ben cooper john's	first son came along early in 1938 the cutest baby you ever saw	and a blessing that he looked all cooper from fontanel to pink toes	nary a trace of edythe.	3.4467120926912904
17398. but the continuing charm of the other	children- sally in 1940 and jack in 1944- and all john's success	at his work only made edythe's dizziness and general uselessness	more glaring.	4.865607178994261
17399. she never could fit into a crowd which had known which	still knew and admired linda.	4.1254259248724425
17400. when there was bridge at edythe's	house the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food	probably was wet graham crackers.	5.381550709979549
17401. she managed a missionary drive	for the church once and got the books so confused that old mr	webber the eldest elder who'd never donated more than five dollars	to anything had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal	in what edythe called the bosoms of the church.	3.2792362701143403
17402. john did find	the missing checks and money afterward and the drive was actually	oversubscribed	which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries.	5.313226550023898
17403. being an intelligent man john must have guessed what everyone thought	about edythe but he never let on by so much as a brave smile.	3.8702990325503084
17404. poor	john was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering	and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one.	5.29661011368079
17405. he was an attentive	and generous husband overgenerous a lot of people felt because they	knew that money must be a problem to him.	4.785381521656572
17406. but he got ahead in business:	on leave from his job to an important washington assignment	during the war; after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel	company.	5.4471718841742796
17407. the coopers saw bobbie and linda socially but	no more than was necessary.	3.700289227276755
17408. bobbie had been successful too though he	didn't match john's pace and after all he didn't need to with	all the stuart money.	4.807873378411027
17409. he and linda settled down to being social	leaders and linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year.	4.138237999586579
17410. and then came the hairpin turn the smashed jaguar and linda	mourning alone and lovely.	6.128583609340756
17411. everyone held his or her breath.	6.083821471983933
17412. don't think linda couldn't have got john back any time	if she'd tried mousie gordon who had been mousie chandler	said between bites of a chicken sandwich at a luncheon table at le	mont.	4.827425742944233
17413. now you know she could've but she isn't that kind of	girl.	4.60221915115539
17414. but now- well it would be a blessing i think.	8.51051157551499
17415. linda evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed	bobbie's death could move her to feeling.	3.744109221929566
17416. what she felt was a bone-deep	loss with a sense of waste to it not so much sorrow for handsome	ambitious bobbie but for the lost years that had been brought into	high relief by his death.	5.521822714256913
17417. she knew what people were thinking;	it was what she had been thinking herself.	4.523177075116991
17418. it was up to her to save	poor john dear john to undo the wrong she had done but she trembled	at the decision as at the brink of a cold stream.	4.801524281207336
17419. there	was no one who would blame her or john; she could be sure of that.	4.565178536315708
17420. it might be rough on edythe at first but linda and john between	them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her to send her	back to cleveland or anywhere.	5.048121290414657
17421. and linda felt capable of capturing	the affection of the children anxious even since she and bobbie	had had none of their own.	3.8373353583020853
17422. it would be good for them to have a mother	they need not be ashamed of.	8.61564968562768
17423. linda would have to wait she knew.	6.533277163336839
17424. but what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty	years gone by?	6.552877026159273
17425.  years of watching while poor john struggled without	the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get	ahead.	4.381023433777417
17426. of course he had done wonders h.	8.464017764265497
17427. alloy steels and	regular steels had different sales departments at smith + macisaacs	where john and bobbie both worked.	3.685338251241182
17428. bobbie had been head of the	alloy division while john was just another good salesman in the regular	branch.	5.313011445832257
17429. so when old mr lovejoy the company president talked	about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the	head of the regular steels had gone with carnegie-illinois it looked	like the perfect chance for bobbie.	3.4465735304831684
17430. for linda knew how to help her	husband not just the stuart-family contacts but also the little dinners	for reuben lovejoy.	5.50969337779446
17431. she was almost sick when bobbie	came home with the news that poor john had won the job.	4.292497144348617
17432. what did	you do?	11.868433137946862
17433.  she asked bobbie.	8.926231624174129
17434. you must have done something something	wrong.	9.525184563452026
17435. lord knows i had everything set for you.	4.6724501027054846
17436. bobbie	said something about damned pittsburghers sticking together and	linda got angry at him.	5.583228874976599
17437. they had their first real fight and bobbie	went off to get drunk.	4.7101977556024535
17438. linda dragooned her uncle donald murkland	into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened.	6.441860833113033
17439. he	was a director of s + m and must have been in on the decision.	5.121293396771301
17440. but jolly old uncle donald would tell her no more than that bobbie	had certainly been considered for the job but there were factors in	a large company which outsiders and even some insiders couldn't understand.	5.166815518143695
17441. he didn't tell her of the long board meeting where	bobbie and john were weighed one against the other.	4.094688601856268
17442. i'm	behind john cooper mr lovejoy said finally.	6.743273855772659
17443. i think we're	agreed that he and evans are equal in ability so we have to look	at the thing in terms of incentive.	4.440367430109558
17444. now i believe poor	john'll work just a little harder.	7.127879658564054
17445. with that wife of his i think	he feels every chance he gets is his big chance.	4.264275825070448
17446. bobbie with linda	behind him will have plenty of other opportunities.	6.155234687690991
17447. and also the	money can't mean as much to bobbie.	5.190621040685773
17448. bobbie will take the	job as his just reward and work hard at it; poor john will take	it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting	up nights worrying about us.	4.432830191042747
17449. most of the directors nodded.	8.484882073094564
17450. uncle donald murkland found himself nodding agreement too.	6.945346011452437
17451. after the surprise was over linda was almost as pleased as anyone	with john's good luck though she agreed with bobbie's decision	some months later to move to funk furnaces.	3.6054107505768176
17452. the job at funk wasn't	particularly better but it got him away from being subordinate to	john and assured him steady advancement since funk was owned to a	large degree by various branches of linda's family.	4.363373892872831
17453. poor john's	rise continued to be meteoric.	5.910973643586545
17454. when he was made a vice president	only a year after the new sales job a leading business magazine ran	his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business	leaders of the future.	5.199866232865657
17455. she called then to say she had a baby-sitter for that night.	4.5197433712653705
17456. shirley	appreciated the chance to make some money.	7.751266970894307
17457. such a nice little thing-	lives right in the building.	5.8814798234765915
17458. that's swell i	said sweetly.	8.457718703298294
17459. i could get along without that three dollars.	5.905305519876634
17460. in some	ways it was worth being out the money- just knowing i was no longer	obligated to nadine!   it was past midnight and we were in	bed when the phone rang.	4.599971998027468
17461. i stumbled through the hall wondering who would	be calling at this hour.	4.344767340770036
17462. i answered to find nadine at the other	end.	7.073410651506126
17463. you scared me half to death i said shakily.	5.29490985613046
17464. what's	wrong?	13.921774766768346
17465.    janice nobody answers at the apartment!	her voice came shrill.	4.477601198394805
17466. i'm absolutely frantic! that stupid girl	might have gone off and left francie!   oh she wouldn't	do that i said.	4.985333447698777
17467. she's probably fallen asleep and doesn't	hear the phone.	4.6724501027054846
17468. but if you're worried you can go home and check-	i can't leave the party! we're at ken thom's	apartment and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat!	old mr thom is already down on wally and we simply can't	afford to get ken mad at us-   i was all set for what	came next.	4.394975143068696
17469. janice could you possibly go over and make sure everything's	all right?	4.331040816009624
17470.  i'll call you there in ten minutes-	i can't make it in ten minutes- wondering as i said it	why i should make it at all.	4.67288338831304
17471. why should i go over at midnight to	check on francie when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party?	3.953509023726795
17472. 	fifteen minutes then! please janice.	7.712079578137997
17473. i'll	be glad to pay you-   so sure that money could do anything!	all right i said.	3.8101576301595865
17474. not for the dollar or so	nadine would give me.	7.631246241495257
17475. but because there was the chance that something	had gone wrong at the apartment and if i didn't go over who would?	4.349168101100218
17476. 	chris was sound asleep and i didn't see any	sense in waking him.	5.583228874976599
17477. i dressed in the kitchen then left a note on the	table telling him what had happened.	4.206209453709868
17478. i drove off through the cool	darkness to nadine's apartment and rang the bell and in a few seconds	a young girl opened the door.	5.621222733954007
17479. her face was flushed from sleep.	5.989162101970683
17480. it's	all right i said as she started to look scared.	5.9245075971793435
17481. mrs	roberts had called and couldn't wake you.	4.913686410369733
17482. i just came over to	make sure everything was all right.	7.034601637526476
17483. i'm- hard to wake	up she faltered.	5.219666477665999
17484. she didn't look over thirteen.	8.764473609234177
17485. and nadine	insisted that her sitters be reliable! i have to get up early	for church tomorrow she went on.	4.365712259053505
17486. i didn't know it was going	to be this late!   the phone started ringing.	5.796167530887522
17487. that's	mrs roberts again i said.	5.619635421798327
17488. i crossed	the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone.	6.647677266310064
17489. i told	nadine everything was fine and that i'd be getting on home.	4.344767340770036
17490. janice would you mind staying?	7.712079578137997
17491.  there was a ragged edge	to her voice now as if she'd been crying.	4.968544043945895
17492. wally's drunk-	i'll get him out of here as soon as i possibly can but i don't	want shirley to see him like this.	5.565218664824761
17493. you know how gossip of that sort	spreads through an apartment building-   not a word of thanks	for what i'd already done.	4.338571317159394
17494. the receiver clicked in my ear.	6.154713990487742
17495. she	didn't even give me a chance to refuse.	5.716214052545901
17496. well there wasn't any	law that said i had to stay! but then i looked at shirley and thought	that i might as well- the child needed her sleep and heaven	knew what kind of a mess it would be with wally coming home drunk.	5.095856229301205
17497. so i told her mrs roberts would pay her in the morning and she	scooted off to her own apartment.	4.605678376594184
17498. after i looked in at francie	i went into the living room and waited.	7.049376331641616
17499. i must have dozed off	because i came to with a start at the sound of voices.	4.797730452092035
17500. nadine's shrill	with anger- wally's loud and thick- as i went to the door	i heard the clock strike two.	5.561687459888315
17501. i opened the door and wally stumbled	in- fast- as if nadine had pushed him.	4.118642075596688
17502. i had always thought	she was so beautiful.	8.407185630032325
17503. but now she looked ugly.	7.116691727554446
17504. her skin was stretched	so tight that her cheekbones stuck out and if looks could kill	wally would have been dead.	5.712259578295962
17505. pack your clothes she hissed.	5.619635421798327
17506. pack- and get out!   you're crazy wally said	thickly.	6.412214371980113
17507. he lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on	it and was instantly asleep.	3.9072530517863884
17508. nadine strode over to him and her pointed	nails raked across his face.	6.157987596957587
17509. i grabbed her arm and she turned on	me and for a scared second i thought that maybe wally was right and	she was crazy.	3.7237957447690797
17510. you stay out of this she spat at me.	9.065115424013147
17511. he's ruined us- do you hear me- he's ruined us! he insulted	ken thom! her eyes were wild.	3.685338251241182
17512. he told ken to his face	that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman! and the other	people there were listening! we're ruined and he's going to	get out if i have to throw him down the stairs-	you'd	better simmer down i said nervously.	4.939685955923826
17513. in the state she was in she could actually kill him! now	you just take it easy and i'll make you some tea-   tea	nadine screeched.	4.011664020825887
17514. how can you be so damn stupid?	9.440622207541292
17515. 	wally's lost his job! ken will never forgive him- never! and	we	don't have any money- we don't have a dime! all we own is francie's	bedroom set and the televison-record player and we even owe	on them.	3.238947641786637
17516. and we'll be poor and have to live in a grubby little house	like yours- and all because of that-   i clamped my hand	over her mouth to stop the stream of filth.	5.097955443288045
17517. stop that! you'll	wake up the whole building.	5.390208621573351
17518. wally can't go any place at this hour-	well then i'll get out- but she looked	uncertain.	5.2288514545018705
17519. she was coming to her senses enough to realize that you don't	go traipsing off anywhere at two in the morning.	4.289832316686924
17520. you	go to bed i said curtly.	7.163184125958424
17521. in the morning you and wally can talk	things out-   she collapsed against me as if everything	inside her snapped.	4.145235715507694
17522. i got her into bed and sat with her until she had	sobbed herself out.	5.650659207443124
17523. it was three o'clock before i figured it was	all right to go.	4.461449937800821
17524. i left her a limp bundle of self-pity shivering	with terror because her bubble had burst around her.	5.317271939457362
17525. wally was snoring	on the davenport.	5.619635421798327
17526. i had done all i could.	9.13239607088625
17527. i had done all i was going	to do.	5.720625602965624
17528. whether or not wally lost his job was no concern of mine.	6.968813893010042
17529. i drove home found chris still asleep.	5.406629921006237
17530. i snuggled up close to him-	loving him- thankful for a man like him.	6.630063084505155
17531. i kept on being thankful.	6.316170410054584
17532. in the afternoon nadine and	wally came over with francie.	7.334410368257031
17533. wally sat in our big chair his hands	between his knees looking ready to cry.	3.8849121559715263
17534. i'd had all this trouble	with the old man that's why i drank so much.	5.331440467598945
17535. i- got fired	yesterday for not attending to business-   old mr thom	himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job wally	confessed and couldn't get one because there were cars on the pits	waiting to be repaired.	3.210707240495584
17536. seems that the kid wally had hired had a repair	business of his own going on the side.	5.694946144723368
17537. mr thom had gotten wally	on the phone and fired him.	4.644019473433046
17538. i thought i'd smooth things over	through ken wally said miserably.	6.606572976866851
17539. but ken got coy and wouldn't	make any promises.	5.052146616597653
17540. and i was plastered and i blew my stack-	and told him right to his face he'd never slept with	a woman! i tried to quiet nadine because the children were there.	5.045508367694265
17541. but she was beyond caring what she said.	5.4277308737438625
17542. things may	smooth over yet chris said his nice lean face grave with honest	concern.	5.6847290773741594
17543. but i couldn't help thinking that nadine and wally were	getting just what they deserved.	4.467534868862152
17544. now maybe they'd realize that life	can be tough.	7.226182303538624
17545. when a bubble breaks there's nothing.	6.660881139671033
17546. little by little during the week chris and i discovered the crazy	unbelievable way nadine and wally had lived.	5.018941970906974
17547. they had not only	spent every cent- they were in debt up to their necks owing on everything	they owned.	4.357525714637997
17548. on top of everything else they were two months	behind on their apartment rent and the day wally received written	notice that he was fired they were evicted.	5.798192814485995
17549. worst of all	wally had no training for any kind of work.	4.660375196601089
17550. he had fallen into a soft	job and now the job was gone and he was stranded.	6.837189225722037
17551. i wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide	them over.	4.8129535804069645
17552. i said i wished we were too.	7.795851174682992
17553. it was easy enough	to say it because of course we couldn't spare a cent.	4.308250112074551
17554. but chris	brightened up like a candle.	7.8672625272876715
17555. i'm glad you feel that way honey.	4.978696971960348
17556. there is one big way we can help them.	8.610098324442925
17557. we can let them move in	with us-   something i had simply never thought of.	4.465303671555456
17558. something	so incredible-   i just stared at him.	6.743273855772659
17559. it was incredible-	he gave me an embarrassed pleading look.	5.016127328380636
17560. i know we'd be	pretty crowded.	10.035277504763457
17561. but it would only be for a couple of weeks- until they	get straightened out.	5.714901142895784
17562. straightened out- they'd had	years of making all that money! i won't do it i said flatly.	5.138210239895059
17563. nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this!	well now she can sleep in the street for all i care!	that isn't like you janice chris said uncomfortably.	3.639764290350437
17564. then i felt uncomfortable too.	10.032444160525984
17565. i didn't want to be like that mean	and bitter.	5.858009463855146
17566. but darn it all why should we help a couple of spoiled	snobs who had looked down their noses at us?	5.547394708439948
17567.    but in	the end we did.	6.333652428243287
17568. it just seemed as if there was nothing else to do.	6.832919749851652
17569. the finance company took all their furniture- and they didn't	have a cent to their name.	3.5177069743400518
17570. to my way of	thinking he was scared sick.	7.541140343206312
17571. his luck had failed him and it was easier	to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world.	4.264818521940508
17572. chris made trip after trip in our old car moving the clothes and dishes	and the stock of groceries nadine had bought on special.	4.745104448051126
17573. at least	we'll eat i thought grimly as i put all the food away.	4.403456081327616
17574. while i worked nadine sat and cried.	7.91014671518764
17575. when she wasn't crying she	was in our bedroom fighting with wally.	4.960272431619719
17576. virus infection nothing	she'd	scream at him.	7.712079578137997
17577. you're too lazy to go out and look for	another job.	4.888980009268317
17578. you're just a no-good bum!   it was a mess	all right.	7.020357139702837
17579. but it couldn't go on forever- a couple of weeks	chris had said.	5.53381541361083
17580. i figured i could stand practically anything for a	couple of weeks.	6.200230991613145
17581. but the two weeks dragged into three and they	were still with us.	4.5118130959097
17582. nadine's constant nagging had finally gotten	wally out of bed.	6.144814417540349
17583. he set out every morning looking for work and come	home around noon full of alibis and excuses.	4.005211874924895
17584. wendell thom had black-balled	him.	8.583161852484194
17585. nobody would even take his application.	6.014177007626459
17586. you	can get something nadine would snap.	7.90307559485147
17587. you can get a job working	in a grocery store if nothing else.	5.312192714139578
17588. the high school	kids have got everything sewed up he said a whine in his voice.	5.250093458470105
17589. those damn punks- taking work away from men who need it.	4.71123924324384
17590. by fall they'll be back in school i'd say	trying to sound encouraging.	6.332602366182877
17591. but this was only the middle of july h.	6.3246982996117
17592. and i couldn't take six more weeks of this.	7.252810095162937
17593. i mentioned	it to chris one stifling hot night when i had slipped outside for	a breath of fresh air.	3.876974976437038
17594. i don't really believe in intuition.	7.95751090267089
17595. but i swear to	you from the moment i opened my eyes i knew it was going to be a	bad day.	4.975817560928929
17596. part of it was the weather so foggy it would take me twice	as long to get to the hospital.	7.677897495362928
17597. part of it was being so tired- i'd	not only had my usual full day yesterday but a dinner meeting as well	that kept me up late.	3.988654635216913
17598. but the rest of it the main part wasn't	based on logic at all.	7.0620269007319445
17599. it was just going to be one of those days.	7.473325852503062
17600. for the thousandth time i wished i'd chosen some nice nine-to-five	five-days-a-week profession.	6.451733982954481
17601. and for the thousandth time i	answered myself.	6.9179002056587535
17602. i hadn't chosen medicine- it had chosen me.	6.9995046480612055
17603. actually i shouldn't complain i told myself in the shaving	mirror.	4.83734907012632
17604. i had a lot to be thankful for.	8.520942185018903
17605. a profession that brought	me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at.	3.782553131683091
17606. maybe i	didn't see as much of gladdy as i'd like but how much worse it	would have been if i'd had to board her out somewhere after alice	went- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home.	4.600194091371803
17607. at least	we were together and we had mrs hodges bless her to look after	us- no mother could be fonder of gladdy than mrs hodges was.	3.7268130404277353
17608. i	was lucky in lots of ways no doubt about it.	6.3106164953107315
17609. especially in the	way gladdy had turned out.	5.334486016314622
17610. growing up without a mother from the time	she was three- it wasn't a good thing for a child even knowing	the kind of mother alice had been.	4.809870598278781
17611. but i mustn't start on alice.	6.712416549506458
17612. she is a closed book a picture i keep on my bureau but never look	at.	6.312192897356889
17613. if she'd kept on as she'd been going the story i'd told	gladdy would probably have been true by now anyhow h   as usual	gladdy's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table.	3.4972694833561255
17614. her	first class wasn't until ten but she always got up to have breakfast	with me.	5.331440467598945
17615. it made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided all	on her own to go to college right here in town made me feel good too.	4.057037364613275
17616. oh i knew that i couldn't give myself all the credit for her	decision.	6.627354918060809
17617. i had a feeling that young pete michelson the most promising	intern at fairview had something to do with it too.	4.648689121875365
17618. she'd	been out with pete the night before and her gay chatter about	their date lightened my mood a little.	5.279898076363117
17619. but once i was alone again	driving	to the hospital the heaviness returned.	4.579096215582452
17620. if she and pete were	really getting serious i'd have to do some hard thinking.	6.882158035139454
17621. should	i tell him the truth about alice?	4.942600426351753
17622.  did he have a right to know the	secret i'd kept from gladdy all these years?	6.195820271574954
17623.    the boys were	already waiting in the corridor outside my office when i got to fairview.	3.692655494837669
17624. two interns and dick ishii the other resident.	7.262113886298175
17625. i'm chief	of medicine here and this morning would start like all others with	me taking the boys on the rounds.	3.6972721029168887
17626. pete was down on seven dick	told me and he'd meet us there.	5.871149430756433
17627. there wasn't anything of	special interest that morning no one sicker than they should have been.	4.333710516120823
17628. pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on seven-	he'd had a case of post-operative shock but it was all taken care	of now.	5.738334899104191
17629. seven is a women's floor and as it happened not very busy	right then.	4.588445521263982
17630. when we'd finished our regular rounds pete pointed	me toward the small ward at the end of the floor.	6.221662412977332
17631. got a new	one in last night he said.	4.6724501027054846
17632. i haven't seen her yet but i	hear she's a lulu!   i wasn't surprised.	5.796167530887522
17633. the ward was	a small one four beds kept reserved for female alcoholics.	3.700289227276755
17634. we didn't	get many at fairview and they were never pretty sights.	6.685963951460837
17635. it was	thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular	charity ward.	4.483588193912329
17636. the moment i walked in the whole miserable feeling	of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed.	5.161425435559664
17637. they'd cleaned	her up some of course and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk.	4.023885801258176
17638. but there was something about her- and i felt my lips forming	a name.	6.867849973575757
17639. alice h but this woman's name was rose bancroft!	i looked at the chart for reassurance.	3.927749573093298
17640. yes rose bancroft	diagnosis: acute alcoholism.	9.27537736129135
17641. she looked about sixty though i recalled	that the chart gave her age as forty-four.	4.141506724653786
17642. an ugly scar disfigured	the somewhat familiar puffy face already marred by the tell-tale	network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry.	5.01479632903231
17643. her coarse hair	was two-colored- bleached blonde and its real dirty gray.	4.584184976644379
17644. oh could it be?	9.921711973122616
17645.  no no h it was an unfortunate resemblance	that was all it was and i turned to dick forcing myself to put my	disquiet out of my mind.	3.9246549240555813
17646. in a low voice dick filled us in	h	she'd been picked up downtown passed out	in the doorway.	5.664556823268435
17647. although quiet when they brought her in she'd suddenly	turned violent and had to be knocked out.	4.7702412052591425
17648. it was the old story.	10.676743302246841
17649. we'd keep her a day or two and the aa people would talk to her.	3.875642649920761
17650. but if she wasn't interested she'd just go back to the same life	she'd left.	8.034895370176882
17651. turning toward the patient again i- i can't	describe what happened to me then except to say that i felt sick.	4.253932529400365
17652. i tell you it took every ounce of control i had to be able to	speak.	7.520923667884744
17653. now miss- or is it mrs bancroft?	5.910403584403162
17654. 	i never	liked going straight into an examination with patients- it relaxes	them i've always thought to chat first.	5.057556181613073
17655. this was one time i'd	have gladly broken my own rule but habit was too strong.	4.242515560107177
17656. hey! her voice was flat and dull.	6.743273855772659
17657. but those penetrating eyes-	i had to turn my head away.	5.380605801245797
17658. it was then that i saw what the drawn-back	covers revealed.	7.078420399412724
17659. there were bloodspots on the sheet.	6.681265522977851
17660. your period?	14.098302569291183
17661.    she	shook	her head.	8.12896173865557
17662. i been spotting a little now and then she said quietly	no emotion in her voice.	5.975652338384487
17663. have you spoken to a doctor	about it?	5.932323736891076
17664.    once again there was a negative shake.	10.221071537699322
17665. i told	miss groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining	table.	4.118642075596688
17666. better do a papanicolaou i told pete.	7.369463567136647
17667. it was only a	few moments before miss groggins had her in the proper position for	a vaginal but i couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination.	3.8686365667618783
17668. pete stood by with a slide and took the smear sent it down to the lab	with a request for the test.	5.80714012690702
17669. that done i told miss groggins to	take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind.	3.9928412655503873
17670. i was busy the rest of the day.	9.589692831409737
17671. late in the afternoon i was up on	seven again.	5.666887730703678
17672. one of my private patients was being admitted and i went	in to see her settled.	6.474155614401076
17673. on my way to the elevator i ran into pete.	6.25289646222516
17674. i've got the results on the bancroft smear test he said.	5.739974350684024
17675. there's something there all right.	5.619635421798327
17676. do you want to talk to her doctor?	10.893296204298396
17677.    well- i didn't-	i didn't ever want to see that woman again.	4.773119978238959
17678. but that was	ridiculous of course.	10.00595935848249
17679. we'll do a d and c and	get her permission for a hysterectomy.	4.0683852436856025
17680. maybe it's nothing maybe	it's intraepithelial or in situ- can't take any chances.	6.113545766112348
17681. if you can keep her here that long pete said wryly.	5.449675814152703
17682. groggins	tells me she's started badgering already wants to get out.	5.9245075971793435
17683. wants to get to her booze i guess.	5.4070732003183
17684. well better see what i can do.	7.95496147702437
17685. we'd been standing	right outside miss bancroft's door and as i went to turn the	knob to enter i was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar.	3.421925851915693
17686. but she seemed to be dozing and in any case we'd been talking in	low tones.	7.503785171590631
17687. her eyes opened as soon as she heard me though	and once again i felt an inward shiver.	4.387314512208045
17688. i sure can't complain	about the service in this place she said.	6.156832949080374
17689. i just got through seeing	one of you guys.	5.615253055697938
17690. what do you want?	12.609141063623753
17691.  there was something	almost insulting in her tone but i disregarded it.	4.952386234405142
17692. i've	just been talking to dr michelson i said.	6.412214371980113
17693. we'd like	you to have a dilatation and curettage.	5.613954262814753
17694. that's quite minor nothing	to worry about.	7.163184125958424
17695. but we would like your permission to do- that is	to go further if it proves necessary.	4.451092572749006
17696. suppose you let me explain.	8.891419061120041
17697. actually i rather	doubt that we'll have to do this.	5.659281004441187
17698. even if we do you'll be out	of here in a week probably.	7.823310313132015
17699. i was sure that was the difficulty-	she just didn't want to stay here where she couldn't get	to the liquor.	4.244016560109434
17700. i looked at her in amazement.	8.667726467923726
17701. i'd had patients who'd refused surgery before of course but	never one who didn't show in one way or another the reason why.	3.707944742107732
17702. mostly it was fear but this woman's voice didn't tremble and	her hands were still on the coverlet.	5.057556181613073
17703. will you tell me why?	7.000488928244055
17704. 	i asked.	11.155741451300253
17705. she smiled a smile without humor.	5.856547304788402
17706. you shouldn't	tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door	she said.	7.178351493164764
17707. i've got cancer haven't i?	5.619635421798327
17708.  she went on disregarding	my protests.	8.761021559502252
17709. i'm not going to be one of your guinea pigs.	6.475610225655379
17710. let your pupils learn on someone else doctor.	7.612467100813403
17711. just let me die in	peace.	7.0572533684087775
17712. i stared at her almost speechless.	7.95751090267089
17713. her little	speech was totally out of character with the sort of person i thought	she was.	4.385378572941117
17714. even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone.	6.721635096985066
17715. this	was someone who'd come down in the world i thought.	5.855906929405385
17716. a long	long way down.	8.312912506238819
17717. again there was something familiar about her something	h   you haven't got cancer i said as strongly	as i could.	3.9602239425016648
17718. i don't know what you heard that would make you	think so but i assure you i don't even know myself so how can	you be so sure?	5.003337607547288
17719.  and even if-   don't give me a lot	of talk joe.	5.173942855003951
17720. she could have found out	my first name of course- that wouldn't be difficult.	6.162729627345381
17721. but there	was that something some echo in the way she spoke h   she was	watching me intently a funny little half-smile on her lips.	3.9095654148948435
17722. surprised	baby?	13.921774766768346
17723.  guess i've changed haven't i?	5.619635421798327
17724.  but you haven't	changed much joe.	9.474886627178751
17725. i knew then knew with a heart-stopping	shock.	5.995794483928725
17726. alice- i stammered through dry lips.	7.163184125958424
17727. alice	for goodness sake-   alice she echoed mockingly.	4.913686410369733
17728. what's	the matter joe you scared of me?	6.743273855772659
17729.  think i'm going	to make you introduce a drunk as your wife?	4.4028701722070505
17730.  well don't worry.	12.347074115237087
17731. just	let me outta here-   but why did you come back?	4.468158710192707
17732. 	i'd found my voice.	8.457718703298294
17733. where have you been all these years?	5.774359526531986
17734. 	she shrugged.	11.155741451300253
17735. as for coming back here-	well i'll tell you the truth i didn't even know where i was when	i came to.	4.107635747850723
17736. the last thing i remember is a bar in san diego-	the way she spoke her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout	made me shudder.	4.778529894894761
17737. and this was gladdy's mother!   i	never asked you for any favors joe she went on but i'm	asking one now.	4.253105613882707
17738. let me outta here! you doctors are all alike-	all you want is to cut up people and what's the good?	5.390723360447842
17739.  no i want	out joe!   i looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before	me.	4.474557543002671
17740. let her out let her out- that would be the solution wouldn't	it?	7.758796789206916
17741.  what she'd said was true- in all these years she'd	never asked for anything from me.	4.1320577981747535
17742. if i let her go she'd disappear	once more.	7.856119580277006
17743. and gladdy would be safe!	i was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea.	5.006349150238456
17744. her dark cool caresses were sweeter than any woman's;	the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one-	the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me	but the air i breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic.	4.441404935231459
17745. yielding-mediterranean-woman-flesh-of-water	she soothed me and drew me deeper into her.	4.477601198394805
17746. i no longer knew how deep i was somewhere under 230 feet	getting drunker happier and more contented by the second.	5.079166692604824
17747. the reasons	for this dive seemed foolish now.	4.376592785638666
17748. only the dive itself had any meaning.	8.58205804022654
17749. the metal-tasting nitrogen made me wonder if i should remove	the mouthpiece	and suck in the sweet water.	3.5566827667207916
17750. perhaps if i took off the	aqua-lung i could swim better love my woman better.	5.891094360125192
17751. i chuckled aloud	and the mouthpiece fell out.	5.406629921006237
17752. while a hazy part of my mind	concentrated on swimming down a clear part sorted over recent events	among them my only positive act in a long time.	5.279402596101825
17753. it was when i packed	up what duds i had and went to paris.	4.560941847257974
17754. it was no vacation just me	getting out after a bellyfull.	6.817026397164171
17755. i knew it wouldn't be the same.	6.650827575488602
17756. wild	kicks never are but i hoped to dig up a better frame of mind.	5.507973357316378
17757. once before i had been to paris long before i married valery.	4.87718298933566
17758. that first time was good and it stuck with me.	6.869844662938435
17759. i was twenty-one back	then in the army and fog put our plane down at orly instead of	rhine-main.	4.479511096722561
17760. it was a saturday evening in april with a mist-like rain	and i was a little high on the good taste of life.	5.965378155023348
17761. i had a pocketful	of money which was unusual when i was in the army and the plane	would be grounded all night.	5.0033880239018975
17762. in less than an hour i had gotten a	hotel showered shaved and was out on the champs elysees in a fresh	uniform.	5.660118245808251
17763. i felt like a hun in rome.	5.404220572333583
17764. all the women were	beautiful	and the men were equal to them; everything was glamorous to	my dazzled eyes.	6.111212922262101
17765. there were some sweet machines other than women:	an old bugatti a lean farina coachwork on an american chassis a swallow	a type 540-k mercedes and lots more.	3.659314705238404
17766. there was the arc	de triomphe and the tour d'eiffel- i was no yokel but i was	young and this was paris!   i had champagne at maxim's	then went into a cafe called the jour et nuit to ask the way to montmartre.	5.127669080786302
17767. i met claire which was better.	5.797053166511289
17768. she was	eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could and washing	it down with red wine.	5.30090553459794
17769. i didn't know a human could feed	so fast and still be beautiful.	4.48337493306014
17770. she was blonde and young and nice	and round in a tight white dress.	6.201820166178394
17771. maybe her ravenous eating wasn't	grotesque because she was so positive about it.	4.454816368521579
17772. when she had	drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill she came directly	to my table and said:   handsome soldier i have assuaged	one hunger with food.	5.233222591777605
17773. i feel another of terrible urgency.	6.479514598427861
17774. is your evening	free?	13.8127899037517
17775.    madame i said with noblesse oblige because	of the handsome- yeah.	4.317068102383446
17776. and so off we went	to her apartment.	8.322144231681426
17777. she was a nymphomaniac of course the poor girl.	6.71945187539135
17778. toward	the break of day i waxed philosophical and drew analogies about	her way of eating bread and cheese.	5.057556181613073
17779. now it was nine years later	and it wasn't spring but winter when i returned.	4.37784109883915
17780. i got	there on a saturday evening.	7.95751090267089
17781. i made the mistake of going to the jour	et nuit.	5.165368187840309
17782. the place was busy but i didn't feel like a hun.	5.375573854500843
17783. i	sat waiting for life to come along and sweep me up.	4.182602481535312
17784. i had part of a	bottle of french beer called panther pils then switched	to tuborg.	6.101915815858932
17785. after a few hours life hadn't showed and i was crocked.	6.449786873260182
17786. i went to my hotel and slept.	7.810534644212733
17787. the next morning a little cognac	made me feel better- but what can you do in paris on sunday morning?	3.589008977199527
17788. 	so i drank more cognac.	7.712079578137997
17789. all that day and monday i	drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space.	4.331209927788384
17790. i read the tropic	of capricorn and the tropic of cancer.	6.385550640529422
17791. that's what was on my mind.	5.484724354538479
17792. i was turning over the idea of a good	debauchery when i dozed off.	7.333200872689466
17793. i felt better tuesday evening	when i woke up.	5.09831305937249
17794. my head was clear my thinking sober and i was reconciled	to this paris idea as a flop on top of all my others.	5.485439540211861
17795. a good	binge has that kind of therapeutic value.	4.618964815664445
17796. sometime earlier	the weather had turned cold and it was snowing.	6.985911835769009
17797. i went out into it.	6.311017448231959
17798. i walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until i found a park	and i sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came	from the sky.	4.893213958404073
17799. there was dignity and beauty in the little white flakes	falling through the blue night.	4.472199142239573
17800. i had on only a topcoat but i wasn't	cold.	7.406536557988163
17801. pretty soon a woman came along	carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick.	4.002254672040791
17802. she saw me and sat	down beside me three feet away.	6.432292157928805
17803. suddenly i understood why she had	the umbrella.	5.531838416784767
17804. it gave her poise and posture.	8.393020847808398
17805. without it she would have	been drab and limp.	5.263991251486981
17806. it gave her the right	to sit down beside me back straight one hand out on the handle.	6.022769370951869
17807. i	couldn't imagine her without it.	5.619635421798327
17808. i knew all about her.	9.836023047470407
17809. she was another	human being and happened to be a hustler.	6.216134546355079
17810. i didn't much care if	she were there or not.	6.662548872677544
17811. after a while she said with sort of an	unuttered laugh you have snow in your hair and ears.	4.223859817977165
17812. hardly glancing at her i smiled a bleak	one which said thanks baby but i'd rather be alone.	5.3006200800412415
17813. she	was silent for a while then said why are you so unhappy?	4.567939398484869
17814. 	i'm not unhappy i lied staring at the snow.	6.144814417540349
17815. she was	trying to make a hole in my armor and i didn't want it.	4.7229323225510855
17816. is it a woman?	12.080178294135722
17817.  she asked gently.	8.926231624174129
17818. she must have seen the ring	on my left hand.	7.357349598927719
17819. well- women and unhappiness go together	i observed profoundly adding you can wager your derriere on	that.	3.8101576301595865
17820. ah monsieur it is not my business to wager it	h   this took me so funny i had to look at her.	5.986728473982379
17821. i felt my	frozen sad face crumble and i grinned a silly one i couldn't have	helped.	4.025949360474192
17822. i even snorted a chuckle.	8.667966011188964
17823. she smiled at me but it	was an awfully sad smile.	4.687080376675738
17824. she was even more miserable than me.	8.236982142455652
17825. her eyes	were smiling too but so sadly and there was tiredness and infinite	wisdom in them.	4.411577383448431
17826. now isn't it better to smile?	8.267746867203767
17827.  she asked.	9.848420478905924
17828. because i liked this sad person so much i said will	you have a drink with me?	5.823360146973978
17829.    i could see the ancient cynicism	reinforce itself in her eyes and i wondered how many men she had picked	up with this same gambit.	4.041326126464911
17830. anyway i pulled a bottle of	remy martin out of my topcoat drew the cork and passed it to her.	5.067657904175087
17831. i could see she was shocked.	7.23772498133163
17832. i'm sorry i haven't	got a glass i said.	6.412214371980113
17833. non non she said taking the	bottle not for that be sorry.	4.182602481535312
17834. she tilted up and drank	and then i drank.	7.057872112361533
17835. it's really rotten to drink good cognac like	that but i hadn't cared before.	4.0148609833502205
17836. i wasn't going to lug around a	glass.	7.419762506052198
17837. there wasn't much light in the blue dark but i could	see her well.	4.8773624019017605
17838. no child this tart she must have been thirty-five or	even forty.	7.303618869346608
17839. somehow she was attractive.	6.683792270355542
17840. not	good looking but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive.	6.340111574279778
17841. i liked her and all at once i was glad she was there.	4.582781218799731
17842. we	finished the bottle- i hadn't had a lot out of it earlier- not	speaking much to each other and we stayed sober.	5.773524434715731
17843. i suppose	we were cold but we didn't feel it.	4.85486375821358
17844. we seemed to be drowsing sadly	soberly in the cold cold air while the snow fell.	7.065638674839973
17845. then she said	allons and we got up and went to my hotel without another word.	4.40242743247458
17846. i sensed no stranger in her.	7.95751090267089
17847. we undressed and made love with	the comfortable acceptance i had once known with valery.	4.160616537259164
17848. i decided	thirty-five was the best estimate of her age.	7.239044161731051
17849. she had a funny little	scar on her stomach on the left side.	5.332079506191192
17850. i think we were very	tired for we awoke at the same moment deeply rested surprised to	see the late morning sun on the windows which were wet where the rime	had melted.	5.4051875130046225
17851. i felt wonderful the absolute opposite of last night's	melancholy.	4.853033070445193
17852. i was hungry as a wolf and	my body felt lean and vital.	6.4488057416895685
17853. bon jour i said brightly	sitting up which pulled the covers to her hips.	3.9701983041559052
17854. she looked good with	her short tousled hair and no make-up.	6.432292157928805
17855. maybe closer to thirty i	thought.	6.603380747348814
17856. bon jour! she exclaimed smiling.	7.712079578137997
17857. j'ai	faim! yeah but breakfast first.	5.619635421798327
17858. with a laugh she	beat me to the bathroom.	8.886559643007205
17859. i called downstairs for food and a toothbrush	for her.	4.85486375821358
17860. she came out pink from a hot bath and i gave her my robe.	5.68245738579941
17861. i had brushed my teeth showered shaved and dressed by the time a	waiter wheeled in breakfast.	4.651726696749205
17862. the toothbrush monsieur he	said presenting it.	6.154713990487742
17863. i gave it to the woman.	6.840805805421318
17864. what is this	for?	13.865296900610126
17865.  she asked innocently.	8.926231624174129
17866. why to brush your teeth.	9.40240925036724
17867. but i already have! i used yours.	6.176081575021015
17868. oh?	13.921774766768346
17869. 	i said with round eyes.	5.619635421798327
17870. i wondered if i ought to go use the new	one myself.	6.636011781743047
17871. but i smelled the coffee and thinking what the hell	live dangerously i decided i would scald my worries away.	4.031008722977249
17872. the coffee	wasn't very hot though made in a filter pot but it was good.	5.421841086976416
17873. we sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham hot	hard-boiled eggs and hot garlic bread.	3.782952247703496
17874. as we ate we talked.	10.447005980520146
17875. her name	was suzanne and mine stephen.	5.989162101970683
17876. we sat back comfortably on	the bed with our last cups of coffee.	6.029944059404745
17877. you are very tactful	do you know stephen she remarked.	5.614458874229062
17878. yes because you didn't run off to use that	new toothbrush.	6.670889458637707
17879. i raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror.	5.4410926936214885
17880. i didn't really use yours she went on.	6.9995046480612055
17881. i carry	one in my purse.	6.316170410054584
17882. i know men never kiss les putains.	8.364429771431997
17883. to	my immense relief she changed the subject in the next sentence:	shall we go to the louvre today?	4.50622747238832
17884.    all right.	14.06695261449629
17885. i	said with enthusiasm at the idea.	5.219666477665999
17886. i put	aside my empty cup.	8.667966011188964
17887. she smiled all the way to her wise sad eyes and	drained her own.	5.45999192651832
17888. what is this	from?	13.865296900610126
17889.  i asked touching the scar on her stomach.	5.70419779047031
17890. it was like a	long thin line drawn through a pink circle.	6.4826315580850835
17891. the cynicism was back in her eyes a bitter wisdom and i	wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all.	3.368412974001728
17892. she understood sex	anyway and played at it well.	7.057872112361533
17893. we went to the louvre for a	few hours then by metro to a cabaret in montmartre.	4.4917021853970525
17894. it was	a nice place not filled with smoke.	7.522065640110001
17895. we had champagne and steamed mussels.	6.671767896167968
17896. the sommelier brought the wine first a magnum instead of	the bottle i had ordered.	4.900432726990401
17897. he must have thought i was a tourist.	6.137679088161464
17898. i fixed him with a steely eye and said what's this for?	6.169056932784706
17899. 	i didn't ask for a jeroboam of champagne.	4.6724501027054846
17900. i thought that	was pretty humorous but i didn't laugh.	6.909920532708042
17901. two letters had arrived for miss theresa stubblefield: she	put them in her bag.	4.334796217719238
17902. she would not stop to read them in american	express as many were doing sitting on benches or leaning against the	walls but pushed her way out into the street.	5.097391465151777
17903. this was her first	day in rome and it was june.	5.893563235683074
17904. an enormous sky of the most delicate	blue arched overhead.	7.935299842702587
17905. in her mind's eye- her imagination responding	fully almost exhaustingly to these shores' peculiar powers	of stimulation- she saw the city as from above telescoped on its	great bare plains that the ruins marked aqueducts and tombs here a cypress	there a pine and all around the low blue hills.	3.1669929963221097
17906. pictures in	old latin books returned to her: the appian way today the colosseum	the arch of constantine.	5.32828117619979
17907. she would see them looking just as	they had in the books and this would make up a part of her delight.	4.40968614324835
17908. moreover nursing various stubblefields- her aunt then her mother	then her father- through their lengthy illnesses	theresa had had a chance	to read quite a lot.	5.289452173884091
17909. england france germany switzerland and	italy had all been rendered for her time and again and between the	prescribed hours of pills and tonics she had conceived a dreamy passion	by lamplight to see all these places with her own eyes.	3.327948491717563
17910. the very	night after her father's funeral she had thought though never admitted	to a soul: now i can go.	4.653079438027171
17911. there's nothing to stop me now.	5.219666477665999
17912. so here it was here was italy anyway and terribly noisy.	6.41308245496062
17913. in the street the traffic was really frightening.	5.143209537065697
17914. cars taxis buses	and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length	of it or swerving perilously around a fountain.	4.861416487662795
17915. shoals of tourists went	by her in national groups- english school girls in blue uniforms	german boys with cameras attached smartly dressed americans looking	in shop windows.	3.4236114157786623
17916. glad to be alone theresa climbed the splendid outdoor	staircase that opened to her left.	5.331440467598945
17917. something special was going on here just now- the annual display of	azalea plants.	4.2517393457628385
17918. she had heard about it the night before at her hotel.	7.563015433947956
17919. it was not yet complete: workmen were unloading the potted plants	from	a truck and placing them in banked rows on the steps above.	3.9851588147317796
17920. the azaleas	were as large as shrubs and their myriad blooms many still tight	in the bud ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to	the palest pink along with many white ones too.	4.36653359775437
17921. marvelous thought	theresa climbing in her portly well-bred way for she was someone	who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to	notice everything.	3.482528606780672
17922. in rome all over europe she intended to move very	slowly indeed.	6.000647228886671
17923. halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat	down.	4.6724501027054846
17924. other people were doing it too sitting all along the wide banisters	and leaning over the parapets above watching the azaleas mass	or just enjoying the sun.	4.843570190820527
17925. theresa sat with her letters in her lap	breathing mediterranean air.	4.317068102383446
17926. the sun warmed her as it seemed to be	warming everything perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill	insides of churches.	4.863785761901157
17927. she loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette.	4.892221409626493
17928. content h excited; how could you be both at once?	5.9245075971793435
17929.  strange	but she was.	6.939425769494729
17930. presently she picked up the first of the letters.	9.761132819198817
17931. a few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted	with anxiety and dismay.	4.294481519111669
17932. of course one of them would have	to go and do this! poor cousin elec she thought tears rising	to sting in the sun but why couldn't he have arranged to live	through the summer?	5.047437899814324
17933.  and how on earth did i ever get this letter anyway?	4.8221607994187865
17934. 	she had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had	managed to find her.	5.448482501884564
17935. her cousin emma carraway had written it in her	loose high old lady's script- t's carefully crossed but	l's inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope.	3.4506562962163647
17936. cousin	emma had simply put miss theresa stubblefield rome italy	on the envelope had walked up to the post office in tuxapoka alabama	and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday	card to her next-door neighbor.	5.589530646693164
17937. somebody	had scrawled american express piazza di spagna?	4.913686410369733
17938.  across the	envelope and now theresa had it all as easily as if she had been	the	president of the republic or the pope.	5.0276185995766065
17939. inside were all the things	they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness death	and	burial of cousin alexander carraway.	3.777612915621391
17940. cousin emma and cousin	elec brother and sister- unmarried devoted aging- had lived	next door to the stubblefields in tuxapoka from time immemorial until	the stubblefields had moved to montgomery fifteen years ago.	4.481223380679198
17941. two days before he was taken sick cousin elec was out worrying about	what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas and cousin elec had	always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a mother-of-pearl	paper	knife which theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised	she could have when he died.	3.484580887940834
17942. i'm supposed to care as much now	as then as much here as there she realized with a sigh.	4.985333447698777
17943. this letter	would have got to me if she hadn't even put rome italy on	it.	4.057684114444392
17944. she refolded the letter replaced it in its envelope	and turned with relief to one from her brother george.	5.253164313632461
17945. but alas	george when he had written had only just returned from going	to tuxapoka to cousin elec's funeral.	4.4136161880780245
17946. he was full of heavy family	reminiscence.	8.993625049744077
17947. all the fine old stock was dying out look at the world	today.	5.572720684591147
17948. his own children had suffered from the weakening of those	values which he and theresa had always taken for granted and as for	his grandchildren he shuddered	to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them	at all.	4.655096453954093
17949. a life of gentility and principle such as cousin elec had lived	had to be known at first hand h.	3.711423929208995
17950. poor george! the only	boy the family darling.	7.168923637169694
17951. together with her mother both of them tense	with worry lest things should somehow go wrong.	4.018861459224993
17952. theresa had seen	him through the right college into the right fraternity and though	pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls safely married to	the right sort however much in the early years of that match his wife	anne had not seemed to understand poor george.	4.625850250740334
17953. could it just be	theresa wondered that anne had understood only too well and that	george all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was	dull?	4.113359822339448
17954.    as for cousin alexander carraway the only thing	theresa could remember at the moment about him	was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night	about one o'clock in the morning the whole stubblefield family had	been aroused to go next door at cousin emma's call- first papa	then mother then theresa and george.	4.8788100401978065
17955. there they all did their	uttermost to help cousin elec get a cramp out of his foot.	4.568570473444285
17956. he had	hobbled downstairs into the parlor in his agony and was sitting wrapped	in his bathrobe on a footstool.	5.094863399621238
17957. he held his long clenched foot	in both hands and this and his contorted face- he was trying heroically	not to cry out- made him look like a large skinny old monkey.	3.5190410774426932
17958. they	all surrounded him the family circle theresa and george as solemn	as if they were watching the cat have kittens and cousin emma	running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming	into a white enamelled pan.	4.647626843589886
17959. can you think of anything to do?	6.296069880048371
17960. 	she kept repeating.	9.52328749892442
17961. i hate to call the doctor but if this keeps	up i'll just have to! can you think of anything to do?	3.978367466012844
17962. 	you might treat it like the hiccups said papa.	6.144814417540349
17963. drop a cold	key down his back.	5.305189007624127
17964. i just hope this happens to you someday	said cousin elec who was not at his best.	5.737288205569982
17965. poor cousin elec	george said.	6.704119030572305
17966. he was younger than theresa: she remembered looking	down and seeing his great round eyes while at the same time she was	dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused.	5.243235079985496
17967. now here they both were still the same george	full of round-eyed woe and cousin emma in despair.	3.945799386474871
17968. theresa shifted	to a new page.	7.712079578137997
17969. of course	there are practical problems to be considered.	5.5409715638919845
17970. cousin emma is alone	in that big old house and won't hear to parting from it.	5.2288514545018705
17971. robbie	and beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them	and anne and i have told her she's more than welcome here but	i think she feels that she might be an imposition especially as long	as our rosie is still in high school.	3.3000918140956523
17972. the other possibility is to	make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher	of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that tuxapoka	is populated with- miss edna whittaker for example.	5.152549843040081
17973. but there	is more in this than meets the eye.	5.058727475575442
17974. a new bathroom would certainly	have to be put in.	7.202582956515978
17975. the wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling	off h.	4.428661373281087
17976. i hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write	me about them.	6.5144780267866915
17977. i may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer	and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together	the best h.	3.874308209845558
17978. i really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette	so early in the day thought theresa it always makes me sick.	6.149320628464039
17979. i'll	start sneezing in a minute sitting on these cold steps.	4.317068102383446
17980. she got	up standing uncertainly for a moment then moving aside to let go past	her talking a group of young men.	6.092225167918224
17981. they wore shoes with pointed toes	odd to american eyes and narrow trousers and their hair looked	unnaturally black and slick.	3.7160475732842784
17982. yet here they were obviously thought to	be handsome and felt themselves to be so.	5.756307602691329
17983. just then a man approached	her with a tray of cheap cameos parker fountain pens rosaries papal	portraits.	4.122503850632783
17984. no no! she said.	10.046960268786682
17985. the	man did not wish to leave.	5.562869927205499
17986. he knew how to spread himself against the	borders of the space that had to separate them.	5.684953471758277
17987. carrozza rides in	the park the colosseum by moonlight he specialized h.	4.182602481535312
17988. theresa turned	away to escape and climbed to a higher landing where the steps	divided in two.	5.354849437066318
17989. there she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant	section of banister while the vendor picked himself another well-dressed	american lady carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag	ascending the steps alone.	3.5869966256211194
17990. was he ever successful theresa wondered.	8.283242024533175
17991. the lady with the alligator bag registered interest doubt then indignation;	at last alarm.	3.6311665274219016
17992. she cast about as though looking for a policeman:	this really shouldn't be allowed! finally she scurried	away up the steps.	5.299246501017047
17993. theresa stubblefield still holding the	family letters in one hand realized that her whole trip to europe was	viewed in family circles as an interlude between cousin elec's	death and doing something about cousin emma.	3.3255244842009084
17994. they were even	anne and george probably thinking themselves very considerate in not	hinting that she really should cut out one or two countries	and come home in august to get cousin emma's house ready before the	teachers came to tuxapoka in september.	4.693993775192947
17995. of course it wasn't anne	and george's fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another	and weren't they always emphasizing that they really didn't	know what they would do without theresa?	3.5944208715636425
17996.  the trouble is theresa	thought that while everything that happens there is supposed to	matter supremely nothing here is supposed even to exist.	4.812128525562479
17997. they would	not care if all of europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow.	4.206494282823429
17998. it	never registered with them that i had time to real all of balzac dickens	and stendhal while papa was dying not to mention everything	in the city library after mother's operation.	5.0068426785967315
17999. it would have been	exactly the same to them if i had read through all twenty-six volumes	of elsie dinsmore.	4.680055319478123
18000. she arranged the letters carefully one	on top of the other.	7.583057336097415
18001. then with a motion so suddenly violent that she	amazed herself she tore them in two.	4.139501869073638
18002. signora?	13.921774766768346
18003. 	she became aware that two italian workmen carrying a large azalea	pot were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could	begin arranging a new row of the display.	3.494992374351423
18004. mi diapiace	signora ma h insomma h.	7.163184125958424
18005. oh h put it there!	she indicated a spot a little distance away.	4.406449118895257
18006. i knew it as surely as everybody in westfield- that lucille	was a husband stealer.	6.447049322423018
18007. you can't keep that kind of information quiet	in a town of only 4000-plus.	4.785071712128541
18008. and i've been told that just about	every town no matter what its size has its lucille warren.	5.623776392858093
18009. just as it has its susan dolan though nobody'd ever bothered to	tell me that.	5.279566732564962
18010. they even talked about	lucille down at the young christians' league where i spent	a lot of time in bible classes and helping out with the office work	for our foreign mission.	4.788068259477783
18011. i never heard my folks talk about her though.	5.401903850885633
18012. they were good-living religious people and i can truthfully say	i never heard them spread any gossip about anybody.	5.434943222559494
18013. even if they ever	did say anything about people like lucille warren i know they wouldn't	have dreamed of saying it in front of me.	4.499461308785805
18014. my folks and my faith	protected me from things like that.	6.500241895327524
18015. and so i was really upset	the first time i discovered that my boy friend johnnie was seeing	mrs warren.	4.30449857047953
18016. i asked him about it one night while we were sitting	in his truck.	6.62682883716681
18017. i asked him if it was true.	7.587325174449626
18018. he gave me a straight	honest answer.	9.324338453336468
18019. look sue baby he'd said.	6.82961481427063
18020. much as i	love you- well a guy's a guy and lucille's willing to-	to come across.	5.859746762404291
18021. honest kitten that's all it is- i don't even	like lucille much.	4.182602481535312
18022. i guess it was at that moment that i	realized what i was up against in the person of lucille warren.	5.620608429011975
18023. but	it didn't seem fair.	7.2916842709135725
18024. my love for johnnie was young and clean-	how could i possibly compete with a woman like that who didn't hesitate	to use her sex.	5.044955454553264
18025. johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber	outfit in a town about twenty miles away and he was also pretty good	at anything in the carpentry line.	3.926717345851906
18026. it was a vivid sharp february	morning that johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard bringing	some stuff dad had ordered.	5.344549037587056
18027. i wasn't in the habit of batting	my eyes at delivery men but the moment i saw johnnie i knew he was	different.	3.7074896090518483
18028. he wasn't only different- he was it.	7.042834174643505
18029. he had an	easy masculine grace about him the kind that kids don't have but	that i had sometimes admired in other older men.	3.7609179819009526
18030. his smile was quick	and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp.	5.271846078902396
18031. the most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he	seemed interested in me too.	4.292421752038864
18032. i could hardly believe such	good luck was mine.	7.570795757270851
18033. and now lucille warren had gotten a look	at him.	5.31372293942427
18034. i guess she was between affairs or something but anyway she	had set her sights on johnnie my johnnie.	5.229423512520904
18035. i didn't	like it one bit.	6.316170410054584
18036. but what could i do?	10.521951279221454
18037.  a man had to have his release-	at least that's what the boys used to say in high school- and	i wasn't providing it for johnnie.	3.912695021349299
18038. she	wouldn't have even if he'd asked her.	6.743273855772659
18039. but he wouldn't	ask her- he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit	to him against her will.	4.223734885344633
18040. and he wouldn't leave her either- he'd	told me that.	7.430626445937771
18041. he was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and	leave those helpless children without their daddy.	4.115223567078138
18042. johnnie	loved me and wanted me.	7.712079578137997
18043. but the only love i was giving him was the	pure kind.	4.844381174338632
18044. it was weeks before we even kissed for the first time.	7.501887384555107
18045. against my folks'	wishes we'd been seeing each other for short rides in the truck.	4.195186549176509
18046. the rides were tame enough- mostly we talked.	5.650577481330174
18047. but by the time the	first crackling of spring came around we both knew we were hopelessly	in love.	4.713070929084802
18048. yet even then we did nothing much but talk and maybe neck	a little.	6.5038818542768215
18049. it's so crazy i told him once.	5.495761876207569
18050. i always	imagined i would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like	that.	5.796167530887522
18051. and you	fall for a lumber jockey.	5.662844612144823
18052. who drinks far too much.	9.389066968812323
18053. and i was ticking off	the items on my fingers swears too much and goes out with the boys	whoever they are too much and who never goes to church	and won't even listen when i try to persuade him to come back to the	fold.	3.506392207649927
18054. he examined his nails carefully.	8.132854117812016
18055. i could walk	out the door.	7.01612408310724
18056. and never	show my face or my truck around here again.	6.279602923243035
18057. he still wasn't looking	at me.	6.220070839612619
18058. or i could visit	lucille warren.	9.205825560719608
18059. he shrugged noncommittally.	7.4299666766730255
18060. and	now he was seeing her.	7.8273553740374915
18061. he'd just admitted it to me.	5.219666477665999
18062. i huddled	miserably beside him in the truck.	8.658718337822245
18063. it was all my doing- his	seeing her.	5.874723268264425
18064. johnnie and i had been innocent in our love and that was	the way i wanted to keep it.	5.357687368696992
18065. at first johnnie hadn't understood-	how could he not being a religious person like me?	4.515029568806174
18066.  but then	he had said all right kid if that's how you want it that's	how it'll be.	5.384813102752371
18067. but what had i done trying to keep us pure?	5.300386625107508
18068. 	i had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman.	5.957756207514519
18069. i had just	the same as delivered him into the hands of the devil!   so	one week later i surrendered to him in the little motel on route	10.	4.393693432941839
18070. i was desperate to hold him to give him whatever	in this world he wanted or needed and to keep him from the clutches	of lucille warren.	5.398252333429738
18071. and though at the time i blushed	to admit it even to myself there was in me a growing desire a sexual	awareness that johnnie had set in motion an awareness that no other	man had ever triggered.	3.5993888668219296
18072. i wanted him with a terrifying fierceness.	8.039895901012384
18073. astonishingly enough it was my own voice i heard there in the	darkness begging this man to make love to me.	3.7180235538978104
18074. i will kitten!   outside in the	summertime	fields behind the motel a thousand crickets serenaded us.	5.953335600396506
18075. will	you always love me this way?	5.219666477665999
18076.    uh huh.	11.155741451300253
18077. and i snuggled closer to the man l loved.	6.59107107560238
18078. it was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced.	5.941472910492173
18079. i had had no wedding ceremony no witnesses no certificate of marriage	but i had all the joy that goes with them.	4.192337385755958
18080. johnnie	h?	13.921774766768346
18081.    it can't be wrong can it?	6.116521480984403
18082.  not really.	15.032964024416673
18083. johnnie rose on one elbow.	5.619635421798327
18084. it's never wrong	if love is real.	7.163184125958424
18085. i took great comfort from his words	and smiled to myself in the darkness.	4.22293954421396
18086. idiot's delight i later discovered.	7.712079578137997
18087. i felt no conflict	between what i was doing and my strict religious upbringing.	4.222331360915784
18088. i had	always resisted the passes made at me by other kids and many times	i had thought about my love for johnnie who being thirty brought a	maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about.	4.478077938157676
18089. i had also thought a lot about how god must look on true love and so	in a way i was keeping my promise to god my promise to remain pure	until i was married.	3.5007892507745044
18090. i was practically a bride after all.	8.267388591772093
18091. there would have been a ceremony if it had been possible.	7.91183235112926
18092. of this i had no doubt.	10.430657233512248
18093. wouldn't johnnie do practically anything	in the world to insure my happiness?	4.288177523954561
18094.  of course he would.	11.583353046619445
18095. he'd	not only told me so he'd proved it.	4.6724501027054846
18096. it wasn't johnnie's fault	that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did	her best to make his life unbearable.	5.305260533684064
18097. just because he was honorable	enough to want to continue supporting his two children as any decent	man would that was no reason he should be denied his own small share	of happiness too.	3.7841235295690923
18098. and if i could contribute to that i'd do it.	8.070263493277285
18099. no price is too high when true love is at stake.	4.584901709342695
18100. and i had no doubts about how true this love was.	7.096025970579074
18101. i'd	never even petted with a boy and after i met johnnie he never touched	me for the longest while not until i all but threw myself at him.	3.3277242066172517
18102. he was plenty attentive all right but he behaved like a gentleman	and i figured that emotionally i was closer to his age than to	my own eighteen and a half.	4.883528684893663
18103. what could a mere twelve years matter?	5.888972357003714
18104. 	it wasn't i was sure a difference in age that came between people	but a difference in maturity.	5.572123461836367
18105. and hadn't i rescued him from	lucille warren?	5.291537558149789
18106.  she'd have gotten him if i hadn't stopped	her.	6.412214371980113
18107. after all lucille warren was a husband-stealer from way	back.	5.4448616603498845
18108. but i'd been a good girl and now god was blessing	me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we	shared.	5.2883476695453675
18109. it was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might	bring.	4.713405825826657
18110. always and always johnnie?	8.616976729002298
18111.    always.	10.144513917544229
18112. convention time in boston.	8.60007483109504
18113. a chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow.	4.870529297520037
18114. from	the entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming members	of the young christians' league and i'd been chosen to represent	our chapter.	6.041140379115461
18115. i had mixed emotions about going.	6.655209316799201
18116. i'd been	seeing johnnie almost a year now but i still didn't want to leave	him for five whole days.	4.985333447698777
18117. but i had looked forward so much to being	with this church group.	4.748743460092055
18118. i hadn't been doing as much work as i used	to in westfield and i felt funny about that and wanted to work harder	than ever.	5.119439358842337
18119. i wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this	fine group.	4.423296389398288
18120. so i went to boston.	11.379627742209005
18121. the first meeting was	held in faneuil hall a great big place where we were able to meet members	from all the other states.	4.058033627176707
18122. my cousin alma at whose home i was	staying during the convention introduced me to a group of young people	from rhode island.	5.675803004556219
18123. one of them was a very friendly lovely fellow	named ronald a boy about my age with slick blond hair and dancing	blue eyes.	4.350853148266618
18124. he looked very different from johnnie- in fact he looked	sort of like me.	6.205115184259644
18125. i thought so and he mentioned it and alma said	so too.	4.630369352631554
18126. after the meeting there was going to be a party at	someone's house.	9.213145145493252
18127. i assumed alma would get me there but in the confusion	of the meeting breaking up we were separated.	4.217099967405562
18128. outside the hall	i anxiously looked around for her then all at once there was a	hand on my elbow.	5.631678410519827
18129. hey there beautiful twin of mine ronald	said.	4.913686410369733
18130. need a pumpkin to get to the party?	8.139340076296337
18131.    i couldn't	help laughing with him.	6.316170410054584
18132. well i should find alma-	i began.	8.591126747194702
18133. by the time we arrived the party was already going strong.	5.880997511801068
18134. a couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and i realized	they were drinking.	6.175653315916847
18135. my folks wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the	house so my first taste	of it had been- of course- with johnnie.	3.739336387274292
18136. i hadn't liked it at first- it was bitter and burning.	6.156832949080374
18137. but when	johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale i enjoyed it.	4.452373707595423
18138. of course	i enjoyed 'most anything if i did it with johnnie.	7.072804066701432
18139. johnnie	h i suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening.	4.087844106041779
18140. but that was only natural i decided; surely he was still resting	snugly in my heart.	6.211026946475012
18141. i don't see alma anywhere	i said.	5.79847623263147
18142. c'mon let's find	out where they're keeping the glasses.	6.412214371980113
18143. i-	i don't think so ronald.	5.619635421798327
18144. aw come	on.	11.155741451300253
18145. but	at least come along while i get lubricated.	4.6724501027054846
18146. strange faces most of them and i wasn't even sure	all of them had come from the league meeting.	6.719424442210946
18147. under normal circumstances he had a certain bright-eyed all-american-boy	charm	with great appeal for young ladies old ladies and dogs.	4.34671170077669
18148. today he looked like an astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on	the bureau and spent six months in space: hollow eyes hollow cheeks	hollow stomach.	5.03558273762859
18149. a shot of orange juice would	make everything seem better.	4.430195070898469
18150. he looked around his little eden:	bureau bed table chair two-burner stove.	5.925422974636065
18151. you share a refrigerator mrs kirby had said and somehow	at midnight after the long drive from new york in pelting rain	that had sounded reasonable.	4.142370069597634
18152. in the cold light of day it seemed a lunatic	arrangement.	7.252747868711335
18153. share bath maybe- but share refrigerator?	5.219666477665999
18154.  she	had explained it- something about summer people's eating out and	not enough space in the units.	5.3919263157477175
18155. and where was the thing?	6.548287861442582
18156.  he remembered	seeing it last night when he put away his small store of bachelor-type	eatables.	5.47495185046749
18157. ah yes- his half of a refrigerator stood outside	on the curving veranda between unit number three and unit number	four.	3.671851228388209
18158. it was still raining and mrs kirby's cottages	bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore vivid blue	and green and magenta.	5.362705117775021
18159. charlie downed his orange juice and one of	the long skinny green pills his spirits as damp as the day.	3.5853166747464886
18160. this	vacation had seemed like a good idea last week when his doctor had	prescribed it.	5.89326968888295
18161. take a full month the doctor had said.	5.510995273767058
18162. lots	of sun lots of rest.	7.712079578137997
18163. the red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound.	4.279906215110585
18164. this is a sleeping capsule.	10.321033842980924
18165. the others will make you a little more	comfortable until you get it licked.	3.860515078000742
18166. you young men get to be my age	you won't take flu so lightly.	6.405154686406557
18167. charlie had accepted the	diagnosis without comment.	5.219666477665999
18168. the doctor could call it anything from flu	to beriberi; but charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew	too that there was no pill to cure it.	4.883246258643023
18169. he had loved and lost vivian	wayne to somebody else had watched her marry the somebody else and	had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever which	was really piling it on.	3.381527603522225
18170. he had caught too like an ailment a confirmed	distrust of women.	6.606928315949526
18171. once burned- scalded really because vivian	had given him every encouragement- forever shy.	4.585002933917246
18172. from now on	his was going to be a man's world: the north woods duck blinds	at dawning beer and poker and male secretaries.	6.323637046318791
18173. meanwhile he	had this miserable cold and as he leaned against the refrigerator watching	the rain make sandy puddles at his feet the doctor's prescription	for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery.	3.4527210419470697
18174. in these damp circumstances	he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia.	6.545767957245639
18175. he looked	up to see mrs kirby awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted	slicker bearing down on him.	4.029398314833288
18176. three-day blow! she bellowed	triumphantly.	8.457718703298294
18177. he had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard	really filthy weather as a kind of pyhrric victory over the tourists.	4.430258705267355
18178. fine day after tomorrow she added.	7.163184125958424
18179. i hope so	he said.	7.430172593458706
18180. thought i'd bake it out in	the sun.	6.743273855772659
18181. you've got	a peaked look.	6.162967476035402
18182. better get in out of the wet.	9.40054764221577
18183. charlie forbore	to mention that the wet was somewhat universal peony being less	than weatherproof.	3.9701983041559052
18184. as for its being fine day after tomorrow he had	the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again with vivian	lost to him forever.	5.521936569559357
18185. he could imagine her at this minute honeymooning	in nassau with what's-his-name lounging on golden sands looking	forward to a life of unalloyed bliss.	3.74755616029046
18186. all charlie could look forward	to was a yellow pill at noon a salami sandwich for lunch and a	lonely old age- if he lived that long.	4.921592194012386
18187. he leafed through the	light reading provided by mrs kirby for her guests: four separate	adventures of the bobbsey twins	and several agricultural	bulletins	on the treatment of hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle hideously	illustrated.	3.4735624193347707
18188. he dozed only to dream of vivian and woke only to	crash into the night table bruising his other shin.	5.023643962570416
18189. he took a yellow	pill only to choke on it and went for the salami only to find something	alive in the refrigerator- something pink and fuzzy.	3.7371900242519014
18190. his first thought was that mrs kirby in her mania for color had	dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator	door and climb in; but on further investigation the thing proved to	be a sweater of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men's jackets-	pale pale pink and according to the label size thirty-four.	4.4526606663036885
18191. he	thought about it for a minute could find no reasonable explanation	for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator got the salami bread	and a bermuda onion and put the whole thing out of his mind.	3.6255582989736714
18192. next morning he found a note in the refrigerator.	6.974914452122834
18193. would you	mind wrapping your onion?	6.916021195327471
18194.  said this note.	11.684131104541487
18195. the smell permeates	everything! everything being the sweater a lipstick case and	a squirt bottle of kissin' kare pink hand lotion.	3.480253516956857
18196. the note paper	was pink too and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine.	4.900432726990401
18197. not that he had supposed considering the evidence that he was	sharing this refrigerator with a member of the beach patrol.	5.185734135935508
18198. he scrawled	sorry across the bottom of the note and then against his	better judgment added: don't you eat?	5.724705219013148
18199.  he didn't want	to encourage anything here; but on the other hand he didn't want	her swiping his salami.	4.433974538257473
18200. not onions came the answer the	following day.	7.934733574561326
18201. must have really smelled up her	sweater he thought and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen.	3.7541465174274555
18202. but then as he well knew women are not guided by logic	or common sense.	5.95465510324695
18203. now if this were vivian next door to him and if for some obscure	female reason she kept her clothes in the refrigerator they would	not be pink.	3.8121109512629943
18204. they would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid chic	and splashy like vivian herself.	6.349182831797861
18205. pink vivian once had told	him	was for baby girls and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously	clinging to their infancy.	3.5853166747464886
18206. why does this girl keep a sweater	in the refrigerator?	7.162753340050777
18207.  he mused aloud.	7.4299666766730255
18208. eh?	13.921774766768346
18209.  it was	mrs kirby making her toilsome way along the veranda laden with	a clattery collection of mops brushes and pails.	4.004848887721715
18210. what's that	you say?	9.52328749892442
18211.    oh nothing.	10.057257835267704
18212. just glad the rain's stopped.	9.483616880284561
18213. just look at that sky.	6.91051859712255
18214. be a scorcher by afternoon.	9.807994046066815
18215. i've got this cold.	6.162967476035402
18216. she scrutinized him.	11.225712054479065
18217. you want	to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash first sunny day.	4.273291059975317
18218. i must remember to warn the girl next to you in larkspur.	6.356263906252195
18219. that pale	kind's the worst.	7.512203395885849
18220. that pale kind charlie thought.	9.195935429839754
18221. but then neither was peaked.	7.013154452139946
18222. he could	hear mrs kirby now warning her pale guest against sunburn.	5.925879823256658
18223. i	spoke to the fellow next door too she might say.	4.317068102383446
18224. surely there was a better word.	9.41775703491797
18225. charlie looked	in the mirror.	6.162967476035402
18226. frail	feeble- peaked.	11.155741451300253
18227. clearly two damp days with the bobbsey twins	had done him no good.	4.252505249283752
18228. the sun blazing hot as prophesied was	far from kind to mrs kirby's varicolored properties.	5.182896016093151
18229. when charlie	came up from the beach for his four-o'clock pill the whole establishment	looked like a	floodlit modern painting- great blocks of dizzy color punctuated at	regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators.	3.4770001074219112
18230. this weekend he thought he would look around for some more subdued	retreat with cape roses maybe at the door.	5.087807509787374
18231. he could not imagine	a flower's being brave enough to grow beside peony larkspur and	the rest.	4.464515946553848
18232. the sweater was gone from the refrigerator and in	its place was a large plastic bag full of wet pink clothes.	4.5635753977982
18233. no wonder	she was so pale wearing all those cold clothes.	4.763445007597945
18234. he got a	red pill and a beer and then on impulse transferred the rest of his	salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled be my guest	on the wrapping.	5.481944157105659
18235. it gave him a good feeling.	6.414028117381216
18236. thanks	was her answer the next day.	7.163184125958424
18237. the note was propped against his	pill bottles and bore a postscript: you're not at all well are	you?	3.645574871056908
18238.    i've got this cold he wrote.	7.163184125958424
18239. not that it	was any of her business.	6.272792891615597
18240. it's none of my business said	the next note but my aunt elsie used to take lemon juice and honey	in hot water for a cold and she lived to be ninety-six.	4.504964201128606
18241. i mean	she's still living and she's ninety-six.	5.406629921006237
18242. why don't you try that?	9.40240925036724
18243. 	i don't have a lemon.	5.619635421798327
18244. he had to write very small	to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper.	7.733605010151743
18245. by the next	morning she had turned the paper over.	5.387187870807682
18246. she didn't sound like a pale girl.	7.487284654669317
18247. she	sounded a little like a redhead.	5.219666477665999
18248. but then redheads are often pale.	8.743611460807918
18249. he stuck his head in mrs kirby's little rental office.	4.467047448170571
18250. i guess that redhead next to me took your advice.	6.6580774558068825
18251. i haven't seen	her on the beach.	5.79847623263147
18252. you won't if you're looking for	a redhead.	8.220963398277965
18253. he spent that afternoon	on the beach looking for a pale browny-haired girl in a pink bathing	suit.	3.942419535582219
18254. there were pink bathing suits on blondes and browny-haired	girls in red or black or green bathing suits.	5.688476173830788
18255. there were a sprinkling	of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits.	4.831064773440629
18256. up on	a dune he saw a girl all by herself sitting on a camp stool before	an easel and absorbed in her painting.	5.135579375829298
18257. he paid little attention to her	because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white- one	of those bulky turtle-neck sweaters.	3.8045958082965017
18258. on the beach there were pale girls	and not-so-pale girls.	7.384475414851039
18259. and he saw them all as he walked up and down.	5.2787578748703705
18260. at two that morning he was still walking- up and down	peony up and down the veranda up and down the silent moonlit beach.	6.089600127733623
18261. finally in desperation he opened the refrigerator filched her hand	lotion and left a note.	4.219854781540853
18262. i've got this sunburn said the note	and i used some of your hand lotion.	5.522345893258039
18263. of course i don't mind she answered.	6.590960225482554
18264. you're	having a miserable time aren't you?	7.163184125958424
18265.  use all the lotion you want	and for goodness' sake stay in out of the sun for a couple of days.	4.896740382690736
18266. this was a very warm sympathetic girl he decided.	8.193102716253945
18267. sympathy	is a fine quality in a woman.	4.913686410369733
18268. now vivian for instance was not	too long on sympathy.	6.861471697908582
18269. she felt and said that sympathy only made people	feel sorry for themselves; it was a tough world and you had to	be tough to hold your own.	3.842936752617483
18270. he didn't know what was so tough about	vivian's world slopping around nassau with what's-his-name.	5.905478493883536
18271. suppose	what's-his-name got a sunburn?	6.162967476035402
18272.  charlie couldn't see vivian	offering any hand lotion.	6.743273855772659
18273. she might peel him once the worst of the	agony was over.	4.576428304594411
18274. charlie spent the next two days in his pajama	bottoms waiting for the fire in his back to subside and used generous	quantities of the hand lotion.	5.278661351965711
18275. correspondence passed back	and forth.	6.162967476035402
18276. how's your sunburn now?	8.457718703298294
18277.  the only thing this	lotion has glycerin in it and that whitens the skin so if you're	so anxious to get a tan you may not want to use it.	4.038282922978472
18278. i'm	not that anxious but maybe that's why you're so fair.	5.9245075971793435
18279. that mrs kirby! i'll bet she told you i was puny too.	4.491700615163783
18280. how's your cold?	9.52328749892442
18281.    broiled out.	8.12896173865557
18282. she didn't say	you were puny.	8.764473609234177
18283. are you?	11.531937615741068
18284.  what's puny?	11.155741451300253
18285.    puny goes	with pale and peaked.	5.619635421798327
18286. do you have anything to read while you're shut	up?	8.1528765483247
18287.  there are two things here about surviving in the wilderness	and a book called 'tom swift and his speedy canoe'; but the	picture of tom swift is pretty sinister.	3.6548908440894414
18288. there was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot.	7.645166728035659
18289. the	new riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that	took a hop.	4.684414651700795
18290. for a few innings the anniston team couldn't figure him	out.	7.966583259937122
18291. then in the fifth anniston's kid catcher caught onto a curve	and smacked the ball into left center field.	4.172922630514852
18292. eddie lee riverside's	redheaded playing manager ran after the ball but it rolled	past him.	5.448482501884564
18293. phil rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the	relay.	4.0683852436856025
18294. eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to	phil.	6.010897374940588
18295. third! third base! eddie shouted.	5.619635421798327
18296. phil	spun around and made an accurate throw into mike deegan's hands on	third base.	5.448482501884564
18297. mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag.	4.450949441202154
18298. but the anniston boy had begun his slide too late.	6.670760033802092
18299. he came into	the bag with his body and mike deegan brought the ball down full in	his face.	3.8589152588243323
18300. you bastard! the anniston catcher screamed.	8.907651622822808
18301. he	jumped to his feet and started to throw punches.	5.15665598934531
18302. mike deegan tossed	his glove away and began to swing at the catcher.	5.993122035679946
18303. this brought in everybody	from both sides while the spectators stood up and added to the	uproar.	3.9913573163670266
18304. the fighters were separated in a few minutes.	6.671706778850939
18305. but mike deegan was boiling mad now.	5.350857324489514
18306. when the inning	was over he cursed the anniston catcher all the way into the dugout.	7.203033616207404
18307. phil rossoff coming in from left field stopped at the water	fountain for a drink.	3.9889527021211135
18308. mike deegan was standing beside it facing the	field.	6.412214371980113
18309. he was eyeing the anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before	the inning began.	4.398207797120466
18310. keep your eyes open sonny! mike	yelled to the catcher.	6.869545288834211
18311. the anniston	catcher did not reply with words.	4.280553672808819
18312. he simply turned to mike and smiled.	7.042834174643505
18313. this so infuriated deegan that he spun around and said: i'll	get that little bastard.	3.9605476819514696
18314. so help me god i'll get him.	7.708995854065522
18315. phil rossoff said: why don't you leave him alone?	4.477601198394805
18316. 	mind your own goddamn business mike deegan said.	6.412214371980113
18317. he stepped into the dugout wondering why deegan	was always looking for trouble.	4.340729159657227
18318. maybe the answer was in his eyes.	8.307274624557024
18319. when	deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips.	4.477280341071502
18320. in the	last of the sixth inning mike deegan got up to bat and hit a fast	ball over the left fielder's head.	5.524333032671862
18321. by the time the fielder got his	hands on the ball deegan was rounding third base and heading for home.	4.794434099363607
18322. the left fielder threw and it was a good one.	8.527372277016594
18323. but mike had no chance	of being tagged.	5.350857324489514
18324. the anniston catcher was straddling home plate.	5.8743971957932475
18325. all deegan had to do was slide fall away but instead he rammed into	the catcher.	4.46887376541391
18326. both fell heavily to the ground.	8.261977394242038
18327. only	mike got to his feet.	5.619635421798327
18328. he went back to touch home plate turned and	walked to the dugout without looking back.	5.929049766136815
18329. the anniston players	and their manager ran out on the field.	4.495214738442108
18330. they poured water over their	catcher's face.	7.7782111142395784
18331. then the manager called for a	doctor.	6.629617803905038
18332. the riverside physician came down to look over the injured	ballplayer.	5.780857199022884
18333. then quickly and a little nervously the doctor ordered	a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room.	3.9424404432307303
18334. mike deegan was sitting on the bench watching.	7.065760799189258
18335. when the ballplayers	started to carry the catcher off the field he said: that	ought to teach the sonofabitch.	4.274824079552819
18336. phil rossoff seated next	to deegan got up and moved to the other end of the bench.	6.99197851374099
18337. the	anniston manager was coming over to the riverside dugout.	5.033255628454779
18338. he was	followed by four of his men.	7.374965067293291
18339. it began to look as if something was going	to happen.	5.3002172783261425
18340. mike sat quitely watching the manager come nearer.	6.412214371980113
18341. eddie	lee moved over to mike deegan's side.	4.913686410369733
18342. no one said a word.	10.133009600392313
18343. the anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of mike.	4.85980743396465
18344. deegan the manager said his	voice pitched low quivering.	6.412214371980113
18345. that was a rotten thing to do.	6.856765274954646
18346. for god's sake mike said waving the manager away.	6.655263276186946
18347. stop it will you?	6.162967476035402
18348.  tell your guys not to block the plate.	6.587544497798754
18349. you didn't have to ram him.	6.490824436842797
18350. the anniston manager looked at eddie lee.	5.8743971957932475
18351. it	was a cold and calculated look.	5.709309598447082
18352. he turned and went back across the field	to his dugout.	6.513174697691704
18353. he called in the pitcher who had been pitching and	a big heavy powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound	for anniston.	4.250664457910106
18354. the game started again and in the eighth inning	mike deegan came up to bat.	6.872862281308286
18355. everyone in the ball park seemed to be	standing and shouting.	5.0149163782225745
18356. the first ball the hefty pitcher threw	came in for mike's head.	6.03477986154848
18357. deegan fell into the dirt the ball going	over him.	4.849837073720137
18358. he arose slowly and brushed himself off.	7.042834174643505
18359. he got back	into the batter's box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again.	4.609948191991858

18361. in the riverside dugout frankie ricco shortstop whispered	into phil's ear: there's gonna be a fight.	4.048524632406517
18362. look at those bastards! charlie haydon a pitcher said.	7.147115778988218
18363. mike was slow getting into	the box this time.	4.6724501027054846
18364. when he finally did he had to duck his head quickly	away as the pitch came in.	6.450405386931355
18365. listen! he shouted to	the pitcher.	5.619635421798327
18366. one more and i'm coming out there!   i'll	be waiting! the pitcher yelled back.	5.901361783042422

18380. it's a helluva thing mike	said looking at phil when a guy's own team-mate won't come	out and help him in a fight.	5.1903148752611425

18408.    no	eddie said.	11.155741451300253
18409. but it does confirm what i've suspected all along.	5.502713871042209
18410. listen! this is the second time	h   sit down sit down eddie said.	6.731977600518273
18411. i'm not saying	you're yellow.	6.392782993823554
18412. i am saying you're not a professional ballplayer.	7.721533111407575
18413. eddie lee leaned forward over the desk.	4.913686410369733
18414. now listen	to me phil.	10.11823024516735
18415. i'm not steering you wrong.	5.805525694497741
18416. you haven't got	the heart for baseball.	8.907651622822808
18417. phil shook his head and eddie frowned.	5.1265274805884165
18418. suddenly his voice grew hard.	8.913937049279573
18419. what the hell do you think baseball	is?	6.401872235607626
18420.  you're not in the big leagues but if you can't give	and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there?	5.808888100258022
18421. 	phil started to say something but eddie cut him short.	4.420211429320824
18422. now don't tell me what a good ball player you are.	6.315833264212564
18423. i know you've	got talent.	8.28786170474199
18424. but what you haven't got is the heart to back up	that talent with.	6.327871207673161
18425. you just haven't got the heart	for pro-ball and that's it.	5.043621647321608
18426. dazed phil said: i	don't get it.	7.163184125958424
18427. my batting average h   eddie stood up abruptly	then sat down just as abruptly.	4.430381901144952
18428. what difference does your	batting average make?	8.356620097469762
18429.  or your fielding average.	7.520559751725462
18430. or even the way you	run bases.	9.642951251740312
18431. i tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win-	you won't do it.	4.631110481562016
18432. that's what i mean by no heart for the	game.	6.144814417540349
18433. deegan had no business ramming into that	kid out there.	4.477601198394805
18434. he did it because he knows for each guy he puts out	of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on.	5.34681101940677
18435. what the hell do you think baseball is?	5.954828721498278
18436.  a sport?	10.901804862545303
18437.  it's a way of	life goddamit! and you've got	to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody	who want to take your way of life away from you!   he's	wrong! phil thought.	3.8460171404483856
18438. there were	other clubs in this league.	9.148467053817539
18439. he was a little pale	and shaky.	7.539563865806338
18440. his lips felt glued together.	8.164255982313843
18441. i think you're	wrong eddie he said finally.	6.24065892855334
18442. you'll	get your pay in the morning.	7.163184125958424
18443. phil turned and left	the room hearing eddie say: someday you'll see i was right.	3.8849121559715263
18444. phil shut the door behind him.	7.163184125958424
18445. outside in the dressing room	frankie	ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes.	4.1895573954892065
18446. phil said: i	got my release.	7.712079578137997
18447. what for?	10.509353167850248
18448.    phil sighed.	11.155741451300253
18449. i don't get it.	7.028761150033486
18450. i don't know phil	said.	10.234400017617087
18451. they were silent for a few moments.	7.120613401587284
18452. then frankie said:	what are you gonna do?	7.498046420169647
18453.    phil started to take his clothes	off and frankie sat down on the bench again.	4.29826641355987
18454. phil took off one	shoe and stared at it.	6.412214371980113
18455. don't take it like this frankie	said.	5.219666477665999
18456. hell plenty of guys get let out and come back later.	5.739974350684024
18457. the	leagues are full of guys like that.	5.158651930272316
18458. what are you gonna do phil?	9.17927326047237
18459.    phil did not answer.	6.162967476035402
18460. why not try another club?	10.189052716254976
18461.    phil looked up.	6.939425769494729
18462. what the hell right did eddie have saying a thing like that?	6.308285828220419
18463. 	springfield's in tomorrow frankie said.	5.619635421798327
18464. he just didn't know what he was talking about	saying a thing like that.	6.259017411391786
18465. will you do it phil?	6.9995575661885
18466. 	do what?	11.155741451300253
18467.    ask whitey for a job.	6.252306666580413
18468. springfield come in tomorrow?	8.457718703298294
18469. 	frankie nodded.	8.12896173865557
18470. i'll talk to him all right.	7.163184125958424
18471. you'll get a job there.	5.951498767062933
18472. i'm not worried about it	phil said.	7.376089603817626
18473. that's the way to talk.	8.515386577940884
18474. what else did eddie	have to say?	8.356620097469762
18475.    nothing phil said.	8.507471126940038
18476. richard's next interest seemed the product of his insularity.	6.780059735484864
18477. his broad reading took him into certain by-ways of religion and the	subject of religion began to fascinate him.	3.767746601765478
18478. when he was twelve he took	to reading st augustine and aquinas then lao-tse confucius	mencius suzuki hindu tomes by endless krishnaists and numerous	socio-archaeological papers.	5.462933498224255
18479. for his birthday because richard had	seen them in a store and asked for them his mother bought him the zend-avesta	and a little image of the indian god acala.	3.9629185843768107
18480. and one	day on her own his mother came home with a present entitled the	book of the dead which she suspected richard would enjoy.	5.242757083908719
18481. he was	enormously happy with her gift and smiled then went to his room to	read.	4.358011127953472
18482. at dinner one night when he was fourteen richard announced	there is only one god.	7.289419576865664
18483. did you think there were	two?	6.448167114333158
18484.  grinned his father.	9.52328749892442
18485. you don't understand	richard said gloomily.	7.159500218971222
18486. through quiet laughter his mother said	don't speak to your father like that richard.	5.9022752337982105
18487. richard	seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about	religion again.	4.0683852436856025
18488. his interest in the formal study of religion waned	when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in asian	affairs.	5.898438375514414
18489. although he still didn't speak to anyone he grew fond	of saying the future lies in asia when the opportunity arose	and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to new	york to give him a foundation they said for his life in asian studies.	3.4112951985289732
18490. richard was a solitary student in new york and acquired	in his remoteness a thorough if bookish knowledge of asian lore	literature life politics and history.	5.470629174112593
18491. he was awarded a fellowship to	continue his studies in tokyo and he packed up his clothes the biwa	upon which he had been practicing and his image of acala and left	to spend a week at home before leaving the country.	3.57993943079273
18492. the week at	home was not comfortable.	6.885880995555011
18493. his mother who had seen little of him for	four years appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an	orient which she herself having slight knowledge of it had to be distrusted.	3.519946851295472
18494. she seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days	he spent at home talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments	of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things	in which he alone was interested.	5.041595383484508
18495. do you still have the	book of the dead?	5.949247107221502
18496.  she asked him and laughing she added i	was nervous about buying a book with a title like that but i knew	you'd like it.	5.031285874973796
18497. yes he lied to shorten the conversation	i still have it.	4.9323966589484645
18498. he was no longer able to relax in the	presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation	with his mother or father no matter the subject.	5.472964941096026
18499. as for the	book of the dead it along with his other books on religion had been	incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which	he had lived in new york.	3.6504906354258333
18500. he had dusted each of the books carefully	and carried them all to the basement and trembling at having to open	the big furnace given them up to the flames.	5.615662465927919
18501. then he sped from the	dark basement and returned to his room and cried.	4.869698956843334
18502. richard left	america with his clothes his biwa and his image of acala and on the	freighter which took him to japan he plucked at the biwa trying	to make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient japanese tune he had	once heard.	4.5452688580099805
18503. during his second week at sea he brought the curious melody	out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain	at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure.	3.5092323816608593
18504. he stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty	north pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water.	4.798359079296209
18505. it was so dark	that he didn't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean	kept him from hearing it.	4.055041383668911
18506. it was as though the biwa had been eaten	up	by the wind.	7.033074992799029
18507. in tokyo richard took up a life similar to	that which he had lived in new york except that he had replaced his	biwa with a friend.	4.5472069591254
18508. an american student named charlotte adams had	refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at	last succeeded in getting him to talk to her.	4.913676623859342
18509. he had nothing much to	say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied	her on some of her unusually searching tours of tokyo.	3.8202529047154044
18510. in charlotte	richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which	after a fashion he envied.	5.31263040208043
18511. in time he grew to depend upon her occasional	company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate	in more social activity.	4.044634850170509
18512. she convinced him that he ought to be a member	of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms	and in the end he complied with her wishes although it was only rarely	that he added anything to the random conversations.	5.972476769312644
18513. at one such	gathering charlotte announced i was at ryusenji today.	5.289166074321373
18514. have	you ever been to ryusenji?	7.712079578137997
18515.  no one had.	9.85749937814625
18516. well it's at fudomae	and there was a tan young man quite naked taking a shower in	the pool.	6.096251064310447
18517. richard thought it a	more promising remark than any made during the last conversation but	charlotte's manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial	than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would	lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded	it.	3.67778567042266
18518. three of the four persons present all foreign students in	tokyo had been playing a game of judging popular japanese foods by	the in and out system an equation in which zen philosophy was used	as the modifier.	5.216335233848708
18519. soba udon and tea were in because they could be	taken noisily.	4.182602481535312
18520. sushi was out because it was pretentious.	8.108299853598618
18521. sashimi was	in samuel burns had suggested because it was too far out to	stay	out even if it was a little pretentious.	4.7931717681698425
18522. richard had kept his eyes	down throughout the game the very sound of the chatter nearly painful	to his ears.	5.407646048906542
18523. he wasn't the least bit disturbed by my	watching him said charlotte.	4.318068015596563
18524. did you watch him?	9.87296046025907
18525.  asked	a red-haired girl named ceecee witter.	5.219666477665999
18526. i shouldn't have been	able to do that.	7.5589462838814105
18527. well i was able to do it charlotte	said with no sign of irritation.	5.943064581317395
18528. i'm	surprised no one has been there.	7.503895660239449
18529. i've been there a number of times.	6.320289817567228
18530. sam i thought you knew everything about tokyo.	7.133996684228573
18531. you've never	been to ryusenji?	6.162967476035402
18532.    i've heard about it samuel	burns said.	7.281492475163533
18533. there's a little place there called lovers mound	dedicated to gompachi and komurasaki.	4.218474732024212
18534. yes a little parkish	place charlotte said and concluded anyhow it's all	very nice.	6.194061019090937
18535. and the man who brought sweet potatoes into kanto is buried	there next to a beautiful seated statue of fudo.	4.3023341245143065
18536. oh that's what	i meant to tell you.	7.573472848649923
18537. this is the interesting part richard	she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking.	4.421065535258743
18538. there	was that fellow out there in the bitter cold-   my	god it was cold today said samuel burns.	5.635788329771492
18539. and the water would be still colder	ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it.	4.633331621033734
18540. and your golden	god said samuel burns probably went right home and poured	himself into a boiling bath.	5.351404517044896
18541. it would kill one of us.	6.990230101723163
18542. but	the point is charlotte said there he was freezing naked	in a little stream of water at ryusenji all in worship of fudo	the god of fire.	4.777119226728299
18543. richard's dark eyes came up and seemed for	the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light.	3.8849121559715263
18544. it was true; fudo	the	god of wisdom was also thought of as the japanese version of acala.	5.815839840087873
18545. the conversation went on but richard stopped listening.	4.485099227122908
18546. he found	himself trying to remember something but he couldn't decide even the	nature of what it was he worked to recall.	5.329411766500077
18547. he had almost given up	when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of	the black pacific was the memory for which he had been searching.	4.020906824839185
18548. perhaps	he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter	and the ascetic at ryusenji he was unable to put it together.	5.497725324865982
18549. that night after leaving charlotte's apartment richard walked	about for a time before returning to his room.	4.362150146867474
18550. when he at last did go	to his room he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before	his little image of acala thinking first of charlotte's tale of	the man at ryusenji then of his biwa and the invisible pacific waters.	4.722053248923681
18551. and the next morning not sure of why he went he took the train	to fudomae and walked to ryusenji.	4.1083220339694755
18552. he was surprised by the sharp	sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which charlotte	had mentioned.	5.740130613069028
18553. he went through a gate to stand at the edge of the	water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots	high at the back of the pool.	4.106510458242024
18554. on the hillside above was caged what might	have been an incarnation of fudo or perhaps a demon.	5.556060335238752
18555. the strange	creature housed in wire made him shudder.	4.1174608023645085
18556. the sensation he so overwhelmingly	realized was one which told him he had been there before	but he knew he had not and could not recall any place he had visited	to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls	or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach.	4.4399832244347435
18557. he left the pool	and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple and the sense of	familiarity with the place would not leave him.	3.7763900707671523
18558. into a little well before	the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he had an urge	to sound the bell before the temple to take hold of the rope and crash	it against the circle of bronze; but the spirit he wished to call	out would not he knew come in the person of the temple priest.	4.557581873731809
18559. instead	he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of	stairs and stood before the seated fudo at their head.	3.625197944200171
18560. the black fudo	seemed to stare rigidly back at him and richard's eyes were caught	by the fudo's in fascination and then richard was shocked as	all at once flames shot out from the sharp features of fudo's face	and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound as if the large statue	were about to burst from some pressure within it.	4.326964801013703
18561. then the flames	were gone the stillness fell upon the severe black face and richard	began to tremble violently.	4.1298075888652255
18562. suddenly he emptied his pockets of all his	coins and dropped them into the box before the seated fudo and hurried	back down both stairways and away from the temple never looking	back.	5.046952498226819
18563. he walked all the miles back to his room.	4.96654946700851
18564. he seemed to	have picked up a virus that day because the next morning he had a small	cough and felt a bit hot.	5.557250435341085
18565. he stayed home reading and refusing to	think about his frightening experience at ryusenji.	4.083443138568456
18566. but the process	of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he	couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day.	5.143935569378761
18567. the	cold lingered making sleep difficult that night and he remained	in bed still the next morning now unable to keep from thinking about	the inexplicable sight of burning metal the wretched sound the unbearable	feeling of having been to a remote tokyo temple at some earlier	time in his life.	3.1124248658882436
18568. all of the elements of the experience were impossible	and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never	again to visit the temple at fudomae.	6.590502738363239
18569. i was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when i was plowing	the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings.	3.965261437062962
18570. it	had grown hot early that day and i hoped that the boy my brother's	son would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground	carrying the jar of cool water.	4.625315767686257
18571. the boy usually was sent out at about	that time with the water and he always dragged an old snow-fence lath	or a stick along to play with.	3.5160557617136257
18572. he pretended that the lath was a tractor	and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing tractor	sounds with his lips.	5.038961147194083
18573. i almost ran over the snake before i could	stop the tractor in time.	4.223549308229146
18574. i had turned at the corner of the field	and i had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into	the earth and i was thinking of the boy and the water anyway and	when i looked again down the furrow the snake was there.	4.999123022312787
18575. it lay half	in the furrow and half out and the front wheels had rolled nearly	up to it when i put in the clutch.	3.9931690711066716
18576. the tractor was heavily loaded with	the weight of the plow turning the earth and the tractor stopped	instantly.	5.17731483230968
18577. the snake slid slowly and with great care from the	new ridge the plow had made into the furrow and did not go any further.	3.330995255255079
18578. i had never liked snakes much i still had that kind of quick panic	that i'd had as a child whenever i saw one but this snake was	clean and bright and very beautiful.	4.959393345690841
18579. he was multi-colored and graceful	and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only	so slightly.	3.966522609218905
18580. go out of the furrow snake i said but it did not move	at all.	7.2386190093970955
18581. i pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out hoping to	frighten him with the noise but the snake only flicked its black forked	tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel without fright or concern.	3.583234135278448
18582. i let the engine idle then and i got down and went around	the wheel and stood beside it.	5.229423512520904
18583. my movement did frighten the snake and	it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped	again and its tongue was working very rapidly.	3.8290183034549665
18584. i followed it looking	at the brilliant colors on its tubular back the colors clear and	sharp and perfect in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of	a baby's fist down its back and the diamonds were set one within the	other and interlaced with glistening jet-black.	4.33024480384525
18585. the colors were astonishing	clear and bright and it was as if the body held a fire of	its own and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin	vivid and alive and warm.	3.435011924997795
18586. the eyes were clear and black and the slender	body was arched slightly.	5.250041518080893
18587. his flat and gracefully tapered head lifted	as i looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that	solemn mouth.	4.226117800756849
18588. you beauty i said i couldn't kill you.	8.054063044931974
18589. you	are much too beautiful.	6.162967476035402
18590. i had killed snakes before when i was younger	but there had been no animal like this one and i knew it was	unthinkable that an animal such as that should die.	5.508648169534976
18591. i picked him up	and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a	little wildly and i could feel the coolness of that radiant fire-colored	body like splendid ice and i knew that he had eaten only recently	because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart	of him like fieldmice swallowed whole might make.	3.3545722194711094
18592. the body	caressed through my hands like cool satin and my hands usually tanned	and dark were pale beside it and i asked it where the fire colors	could come from the coolness of that body.	4.427471137642762
18593. i lowered him so he would	not fall and his body slid out onto the cool newly-plowed earth from	between my pale hands.	3.6539122345273842
18594. the snake worked away very slowly and delicately	and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty and he carried	his head a little above the rolled clods.	4.431672158379969
18595. the sharp burning colors of	his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil like a target.	3.4284303263313203
18596. i felt good and satisfied looking at the snake.	6.962579340209577
18597. it shone	in its bright diamond color against the sun-burned stubble and the	crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself.	3.8931347893732737
18598. the	color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien too	in that dry and dusty and uncolored field.	4.962645065390774
18599. i got on the tractor	again and i had to watch the plow closely because the field was	drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a	danger of rocks.	3.8311972709217486
18600. i had my back to the corner of the triangular field	that pointed towards the house.	7.635031332699041
18601. the earth was a little heavy and i	had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring	properly and i did not look back towards the place until i had turned	the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field	a long way from where i had stopped because of the snake.	3.4678546696317167
18602. i saw it all at a glance.	8.231225215084793
18603. the boy was there at the lower corner of	the field and he was in the plowed earth stamping with ferocity and	a kind of frenzied impatience.	4.02591674177235
18604. even at that distance with no sound but	the sound of the tractor i could tell the fierce mark of brutality	on the boy.	5.369952015861351
18605. i could see the hunched-up shoulders the savage determination	the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels	and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick.	3.644161300750621
18606. stop it i shouted but the lumbering and mighty tractor roared on	above anything i could say.	5.138210239895059
18607. i stopped the tractor and i shouted	down to the boy and i knew he could hear me for the morning was clear	and still but he did not even hesitate in that brutal murdering	dance.	3.7053318720927972
18608. i felt myself tremble thinking of the diamond	light of that beauty i had held a few moments before and i wanted	to run down there and halt if i could that frenetic pirouette catch	the boy in the moment of his savagery and save a glimmer a remnant	of that which i remembered but i knew it was already too late.	4.727059968724115
18609. i	drove the tractor on not looking down there; i was afraid to look	for fear the evil might still be going on.	3.574508311298289
18610. my head began to ache and	the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes and i hated the job	suddenly and i thought there are only moments when one sees beautiful	things and these are soon crushed or they vanish.	4.663970269517013
18611. i felt the	anger mount within me.	5.79563393273625
18612. the boy waited at the corner with the	jar of water held up to me in his hands and the water had grown bubbly	in the heat of the morning.	4.871697227778
18613. i knew the boy well.	7.515880018436187
18614. he was eleven and	we had done many things together.	7.025114488421098
18615. he was a beautiful boy really with	finely-spun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face and	his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike and his eyes were blue.	3.8109347168924357
18616. he waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up as he would	smile on any other day.	5.209319798241556
18617. he was my nephew my brother's son handsome	and warm and newly-scrubbed with happiness upon his face and his face	resembled my brother's and mine as well.	3.585642296624282
18618. i saw then too	the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil through something	there where i had been not long before.	5.3886993599185296
18619. i stopped the tractor	and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me.	4.249837642269575
18620. can i	ride around with you?	9.416333258945464
18621.  he asked as he often did and i had as often	let him be on the tractor beside me.	4.161432630390685
18622. i looked closely at his eyes	and he was already innocent; the killing was already forgotten in	that clear mind of his.	5.166377838094874
18623. no you cannot i said pushing	aside the water jar he offered to me.	4.305300495973382
18624. i pointed to the splintered upright	stake.	8.422882036865504
18625. did you do that?	7.194225339396958
18626.  i asked.	13.29281579470557
18627. yes he	said eagerly beginning a kind of dance of excitement.	5.722510894139569
18628. i killed	a snake; it was a big one.	8.8663020722857
18629. he tried to take my hand to show	me.	5.417227320082015
18630. why did you kill it?	10.129230467642362
18631.    snakes are ugly and	bad.	6.162967476035402
18632. this snake was very beautiful.	8.015296427524206
18633. didn't you see	how beautiful it was?	5.219666477665999
18634.    snakes are ugly he said again.	7.163184125958424
18635. you saw the colors of it didn't you?	5.603064169507924
18636.  have you ever	seen anything like it around here?	7.620918595200117
18637.    snakes are ugly and	bad and it might have bitten somebody and they would have died.	4.303900665894175
18638. you know there are no poisonous snakes in this area.	7.973226817005812
18639. this	snake could not harm anything.	5.619635421798327
18640. they eat chickens sometimes	the boy said.	7.7782111142395784
18641. they are ugly and they eat chickens and i	hate snakes.	4.922843133820261
18642. you are talking foolishly i said.	9.614553137932045
18643. you	killed it because you wanted to kill it for no other reason.	4.0683852436856025
18644. they're ugly and i hate them the boy insisted.	6.144814417540349
18645. it was beautiful i said half to	myself.	5.619509663343971
18646. the boy skipped along beside me and he was contented	with what he had done.	5.620252823944656
18647. the fire of the colors was gone; there	was a contorted ugliness now; the colors of its back were dull and	gray-looking torn and smashed in and dirty from the boy's shoes.	3.280346132773565
18648. the beautifully-tapered head so delicate and so cool had been flattened	as if in a vise and the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted	torn mouth.	4.91703744581344
18649. the snake was hideous and i remembered even then the	cool bright fire of it only a little while before and i thought	perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that and had	not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life.	3.249659740491162
18650. i wrenched	the stake out that the boy had driven through it in the thickest	part of its body between the colored diamond crystals.	5.770860338770212
18651. i touched it	and the coolness the ice-feeling was gone and even then it moved a	little perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles and i hoped that it	was truly dead so that i would not have to kill it.	3.7625890442971666
18652. and then it moved	a little more and i knew the snake was dying and i would have	to kill it there.	5.68729464722606
18653. the boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again	and he was racing innocently in circles making the buzzing tractor	sound with his lips.	3.578355074688169
18654. i'm sorry i thought to the snake	for you were beautiful.	6.169973731856354
18655. i took the broken length of it around the tractor	and i took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and i struck its	head not looking at it to kill it at last for it could never live.	3.4775818066936
18656. the boy came around behind me dragging the stake.	5.673706576829973
18657. it's	a big snake isn't it?	5.619635421798327
18658.  he said.	12.081077223713681
18659. i'm going to tell everybody	how big a snake i killed.	4.317068102383446
18660. don't you see what you	have done?	7.163184125958424
18661.  i said.	9.686204316035266
18662. don't you see the difference now?	7.5645206290766165
18663. 	it's an ugly terrible snake he said.	4.913686410369733
18664. he came up and	was going to push at it with his heavy shoes.	5.762859306307814
18665. i could see the happiness	in the boy's eyes the gleeful brutality.	5.604080946312186
18666. i could have slapped the boy.	8.724258526724151
18667. he looked up at me puzzled	and he swayed his head from side to side.	3.9892296742044127
18668. i thought you little brute	you nasty selfish little beast with brutality already developed	within that brain and in those eyes.	5.378100020931596
18669. i wanted to slap his face to	wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth and i decided	then very suddenly what i would do.	3.5981684770915403
18670. cady didn't come unglued easily but this had not been a day	of glad tidings.	5.995690262117482
18671. tax worries production worries personnel worries	and the letter from hanford college his own alma mater a real snapper.	3.632711015013689
18672. hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago.	5.9245075971793435
18673. yes the boy's credentials were in order- scholastic transcript	character references picture health record successful college boards.	4.168235426842114
18674. but due to the many applicants on file would he co-operate and write	a personal letter giving them his son's motivation interests and	his qualifications for leadership?	5.154010998070301
18675.    cady partlow lit his	pipe with no comfort.	4.913686410369733
18676. this was the letter which would	or would not enroll his son david in hanford.	6.329426338727661
18677. his son who had never	held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life.	4.073500025956264
18678. his son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor lawyer merchant	or chief.	6.9092066186890175
18679. he wondered if he had played it wrong.	5.643982051895357
18680. maybe	he should have kept in touch.	7.163184125958424
18681. but he had been	busy building a business being a big man in his own town just as	he had been a big man at hanford class of 1935.	4.257181056182657
18682. besides cady partlow	knew he wasn't the old-grad-type.	7.602801658488257
18683. look at pete alcorn who hadn't missed a hanford ball game	in fifteen years.	4.456534970259679
18684. hanford college	little	ivy league had no room for football players with low grades.	5.764768621839715
18685. cady looked at his own son's scholastic record with pride.	4.317068102383446
18686. good	solid b average with a sprinkling of a's in math and science.	5.733786771862854
18687. imagine his son being that good in science! mr partlow could	still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered	what a near thing chemistry had been for him at hanford.	3.3209989097692594
18688. but then	he hadn't studied very hard.	7.8672625272876715
18689. getting elected president of the student	body took a lot of time and politicking.	6.028471505417091
18690. he put down his	pipe and started to type.	6.669008114769246
18691. in response to your letter i can in good	conscience recommend my son david in the field of leadership.	4.6098669424608385
18692. he stopped and looked at the picture of his son the picture on	his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate	for hanford college.	4.730309543895308
18693. he didn't have to be told his son looked	like him.	5.415566871897917
18694. david had the same gray eyes high cheekbones dark hair	and a certain rugged ugliness.	5.331440467598945
18695. he turned back to the typewriter with a little more	confidence.	6.003374774174528
18696. his interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics	tennis and swimming.	5.939881127200001
18697. his chief motivation for enrolling at	hanford is the desire to-   mr partlow banged his fist	on the keyboard ruining the letter.	3.6735492447580875
18698. he paced to the window and looked	at the city he had helped to build.	5.5333139970253615
18699. how do you tell a college	president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do?	4.650557998804575
18700.  that	you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him	into a profession so you can say at the club of course david has	known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer- or a lawyer	or an editor?	5.163625356733011
18701.    how do you tell a college like hanford that	your son has a vast potential that he will find himself?	4.236224263017036
18702.  just give	him time give him a chance.	7.9862990628559976
18703. cady snapped the venetian blind	shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter rolled in a fresh	sheet and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed	on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head.	3.375246433535825
18704. what a production to make of a letter commending your own son!	his eyebrow went up in amusement at his soul-searching panic.	5.48184892834441

18709. then he met the grave eyes of his wife anne from the photograph	next to david's.	4.695089830658892
18710. he shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket.	6.375016808455901
18711. better show it to anne and see if he had omitted anything.	4.836025345776909
18712. after all his wife had written most of his letters for him in those	first lean days of partlow products.	5.820342435897576
18713. anne had a way with words.	5.219666477665999
18714. half	of it was natural half was smith college.	6.49230517045165
18715. yet the whole	of anne was something she had never learned in any college.	4.5725453021831095
18716. a woman	had it or she didn't.	7.064901200998796
18717. she said what she meant and let	it be.	5.667019489198622
18718. she never got on his back.	8.332036790826002
18719. he could take the advice or leave	it.	6.432280287363512
18720. he whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he	got on the elevator.	5.536242691398416
18721. you look like you just heard a real gasser	mr partlow.	5.041587404040665
18722. cady looked at tom who had taken	him	up and down for fifteen years.	5.583228874976599
18723. i was just thinking how things have	changed.	6.02166701493472
18724. when i went to college they begged you to come.	7.4602311204193095
18725. be our	guest! it's our pleasure! now you have to be well rounded firm	in motivation and pre-packed with knowledge!   tom slid	open	the door to the lobby.	4.235735484434915
18726. that's a fact mr partlow.	7.869393827707878
18727. my john	applied to six colleges before he got in.	4.947900054435123
18728. he's president of the rocket club here	you know.	7.91412965825233
18729. always messing around with science stuff.	5.4787119204811825
18730. real bright along	those lines you might say.	6.743273855772659
18731. he got a science scholarship to yale.	5.777858868521778
18732. oh	said mr partlow that's fine tom.	7.163184125958424
18733. as he drove home through the thinning traffic cady	felt the unease growing.	4.808001223801902
18734. he hadn't told anyone but he too had applied	to five colleges for david.	5.603893504423084
18735. they had all turned down his son.	6.3134276791463755
18736. limited interests.	11.155741451300253
18737. he suddenly realized when he walked	into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the martini	anne had waiting for him.	3.6314894049157838
18738. but tonight his drink tasted like branch	water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no	surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket.	4.720227739900373
18739. nor did looking at anne ease the tension as it usually did.	4.6187867444399195
18740. he liked	looking at anne.	8.978600574448244
18741. he liked her blond hair and the	sprinkle of freckles across her nose.	4.524380497173867
18742. from those navy-blue eyes she	saw things as clearly and honestly as david did.	6.028003962297117
18743. she always could sense	the shag end of a woolly day.	5.183238826165116
18744. board meeting tonight cady?	8.678386464259699
18745. 	no i begged off.	6.162967476035402
18746. can	i have the car dad?	7.712079578137997
18747.    why not let him take it cady?	6.171042974642865
18748. 	i know it is midweek but it's only eight days before commencement.	5.801198285702787
18749. cady deep in thought neither	heard nor answered.	4.913686410369733
18750. carefully he put down his	steak knife and said loudly mr chairman!   cady	partlow's head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse.	5.397577686608056
18751. the car?	6.312547831092381
18752.  of course you can have it.	9.85972202825122
18753. dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else slowly methodically	and with interest.	4.037909117808319
18754. hear anything from hanford yet dad?	7.163184125958424
18755. 	cady begged the question.	6.162967476035402
18756. don't worry about it dave.	7.712079578137997
18757. your acceptance will come through.	6.568815526344989
18758. dave shrugged on his	sports coat and picked up the car keys.	6.309895763432548
18759. don't be too sure dad.	5.732322415016083
18760. charles burke got turned down by dartmouth and he is a straight-a	student.	7.381265663726297
18761. anne said it wasn't surprising because charles	was antisocial a lone wolf and completely one-sided.	3.8849121559715263
18762. i can hardly	say the same about you dave!   dave kissed her lightly.	6.470531513505638
18763. girls my dear parent are here to stay! get my old man to	bed early.	3.8849121559715263
18764. he looks a little bit frayed.	8.074238009482013
18765. anne waited until	the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot.	4.5980102988164635
18766. let's go into	the library.	8.659302732109612
18767. you do seem somewhat tattered.	7.152016112966155
18768. cady trailed	her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable	book-lined room.	5.138210239895059
18769. i didn't know i looked so dilapidated!	wrong word darling.	4.85486375821358
18770. your fur has been rubbed the	wrong way and you show it.	6.303435399573754
18771. need any help?	7.741885848474694
18772.    in a way yes.	13.335010366567722
18773. hanford college hasn't decided on dave's application yet.	4.6724501027054846
18774. they	want a letter from me on his motives interests and leadership.	6.182055086891916
18775. cady handed her the letter drank his	coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence.	3.8522054446267973
18776. already he could feel anne's questioning eyes.	7.620695535889825
18777. i know you	wrote this in a hurry	but cady dave was only acting president	of the student forum for a few days.	4.282033021210505
18778. that was when half the school	was down with flu.	7.845256651556856
18779. and he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club.	5.3685601638457126
18780. he just took over the week bill daley was in the state basketball play-off.	7.603136161062304
18781. cady stuck his jaw out.	5.619635421798327
18782. the fact remains he was	treasurer.	9.685121966116846
18783. no cady he	made second team.	6.549083679307419
18784. a team is a team insisted cady.	6.946277801594279
18785. anything	else?	10.144513917544229
18786.    yes she said quietly.	10.409583009979668
18787. i don't think	you've been quite honest cady.	5.406629921006237
18788. astronomy.	13.921774766768346
18789. he was mad about stars at the age of nine.	5.676163528824439
18790. geology	you and dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond	six years ago! those aren't his interests now.	5.3112517321042105
18791. what	do you suggest?	6.939425769494729
18792.    just say he likes swimming tennis	chess and music.	7.485186973410807
18793. music! he hasn't been to a symphony	concert all season.	4.477601198394805
18794. but he plays bass	with chief crazy horse and his five colts!   you	mean that rock-and-roll combo?	5.916532878946053
18795.  even in that he never solos like jack	on guitar or rich on sax.	5.238314902444521
18796. he's- he's just there that's	all.	7.712079578137997
18797. he keeps the beat going.	6.208226663184664
18798. he	likes to play bass because he doesn't have to solo.	6.177976509017137
18799. he doesn't	like to rise and shine.	5.475289483739853
18800. don't worry cady he'll be back in the	beethoven fold by next year.	5.777410734547035
18801. but i refuse to be brutally honest and mention	chief crazy horse and his five colts.	4.482032674293921
18802. anne laughed and	cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck.	6.104777916446873
18803. maybe	i am padding it a bit anne he said.	4.667242314163226
18804. but you know how hard	it is to get a boy into a good college.	7.457505454002596
18805. he has to have leadership	as well as grades.	6.297174973164894
18806. anne folded the worrisome document.	7.712079578137997
18807. did	you know he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale this	weekend?	4.632047966749354
18808.  he hasn't used it now for several years.	6.672854314451728
18809. can you really	say his motivation for college is electronics?	5.367758095129673
18810.    cady felt	the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel.	5.658860671225442
18811. and what	would you say he wants to do?	5.615894991511619
18812.  just what?	15.212555949771327
18813.    it's	dave who is applying to hanford college.	4.913686410369733
18814. why don't you ask him?	9.40240925036724
18815. 	for once cady partlow wished anne would yell at him so	he could yell back.	3.8849121559715263
18816. i have talked to him but you know i've never	tried to push him into any profession.	5.948928150697104
18817. i won't be guilty of trying	to run his life.	4.85486375821358
18818. anne picked up the towel she was hemming	for the hospital guild.	6.310045727905607
18819. just because your father tried to make	a banker out of you you've leaned over backward to keep your hands	off.	4.042133528753856
18820. but subconsciously you've wanted him to conform to your mold.	6.506226438631595
18821. you want him to be a leader of men like you.	6.497474225013101
18822. cady put the	well-worn chip back on his shoulder.	6.688253509490943
18823. dave has qualities of leadership.	5.619635421798327
18824. he just hasn't developed them yet.	8.15139492359112
18825. he never will cady.	6.887379684013672
18826. not the kind of leadership you mean working	with lots of people.	7.528582757379001
18827. all your wishful thinking won't change	that.	5.9966236261712105
18828. remember what you used to say in the army?	6.935383666103533
18829.  you can't run a war	with ninety-nine generals and one private!   cady walked	the block to the mailbox almost ashamed of himself for arguing with anne.	3.8350736198478845
18830. martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist	at all.	6.194951624072196
18831. and once begun had grown to such monstrous proportions.	5.103496064419526
18832. the pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life.	5.52901645174826
18833. lying awake	at night he could see them laid out on the floor of his mind.	4.874577364048552
18834. when	he rose in the morning the image was still there.	6.771690471133949
18835. he had always	been a messy and negligent man.	5.570660943487726
18836. in his bachelor days his bedroom	had been strewn with clothes which his mother or later the hotel maid	generally saw fit to put in order.	5.295494462798919
18837. no doubt dolores resented following	in their footsteps.	6.149419520806999
18838. but it was fun those first days kidding	about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug.	6.063871934043163
18839. there	was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up.	4.411093425964874
18840. half	slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things.	6.104766048564336
18841. he	remembered the first time he saw her standing across the room at a party.	4.7198782895739555
18842. the smooth curve of her neck very white against hair which curled	against it like petals.	4.827508206929211
18843. her hair was the color of those blooms which	in seed catalogues are referred to as black but since no flower	is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple	or blue- he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers	searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its	true shade beneath the darkness.	3.2683923129885466
18844. so he sought her out and spoke	to her and thought of his hand in her hair.	6.001436896088574
18845. or against her back	pressed on the column of vertebrae which held her so magnificently	straight and unyielding until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking	noises like the snapped stem of a tulip.	3.4213616384155725
18846. but to put it	bluntly nothing snapped.	9.058126824764873
18847. yet that had not seriously troubled him	not then.	5.7356288735302305
18848. more he could take at leisure.	8.713931629047092
18849. all martin	thought he needed was time: to what better use could time be put?	4.197091119089118
18850. 	he saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly.	6.982939006300306
18851. there	was too little occasion beforehand for resistance the brave strong	delights of emotional clash and meeting.	4.036318582055924
18852. they had left themselves	too much to discover.	8.342735917174288
18853. but at the start his new life felt invigorating.	6.429823482437202
18854. it was on the tenth day after the wedding	that he dropped the shorts on the floor.	6.53699550816362
18855. now i'm not going to pick up those shorts!	martin gave her a teasing pat.	5.06573471022908
18856. i think you'll get tired of	them there.	8.564338193601051
18857. in the morning the shorts were where he had left	them.	5.53449466686579
18858. he smiled to himself and decided not to mention them till	dolores did.	6.088375047702318
18859. it was almost too easy.	6.945278133517863
18860. for he had just remembered:	tonight they were having their first guests.	7.23135882474722
18861. the shorts would not be	on the floor when he came home that evening.	3.8560455783223677
18862. the	rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness but in	the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts.	5.740132856784866
18863. they gave the room	a strange note of incongruity like a mole on a beautiful face.	3.9789745378525514
18864. he saw that dolores intended to wait until the last minute thinking	he would get nervous.	6.488420193792557
18865. quietly he determined to foil her.	5.219666477665999
18866. i can	be as stubborn as she can he thought; my nerves are as strong.	5.65219859595529
18867. she'll	rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings.	4.794789585879942
18868. martin was standing a few feet from the front	door.	7.056998499717142
18869. he swung around eyes toward the bedroom some fifteen feet	away.	4.467047448170571
18870. dolores stood motionless in the doorway.	7.163184125958424
18871. he could not cross	the living room brush past her and bend down to retrieve the shorts.	4.352495921757181
18872. he strode to answer the bell.	8.140457122673942
18873. bill's hat was deposited in the hall closet.	5.154315670223916
18874. with the most casual	and relaxed manner in the world dolores led anthea to the bedroom.	7.384668070482362
18875. at first he could not be sure.	8.118717407494978
18876. then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there.	7.1275005239426
18877. a glissade of giggles slid over their voices.	4.618964815664445
18878. all evening anthea	favored him with odd coy looks.	7.200436508448407
18879. clearly she had been instructed	not to say a word.	5.290016078379641
18880. for some reason this ellipsis in the conversation	spread until it swallowed up every other topic.	5.914621626651891
18881. at last there	was a void no one could fill.	5.462209161364096
18882. the brainards went home early.	6.5155523300336915
18883. martin realized later on that he should have had it out with	dolores that night.	4.228388603586972
18884. but he was so taken	aback he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in.	6.444397311501371
18885. on the contrary it would only weaken his position if he fumed while	she stayed calm and adamant.	4.340494851738806
18886. and if he surrendered after raving	at her.	8.841133976576819
18887. suppose he ran up the white flag altogether?	5.3280756530320685
18888. 	at once.	11.155741451300253
18889. he considered the sober possibility.	5.926245264679889
18890. in	his head was the echo of those titters with anthea.	5.978086217609657
18891. there was	something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel	scabrous and unclean.	4.5846651265348575
18892. he remembered his mother gossiping with her	neighborhood women friends	lowering her voice to a penetrating hoarseness	which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs where he	crouched listening.	4.973396433172729
18893. he could even recall the last time he sat there.	5.239304289360611
18894. she was talking about him that time because he had done some bad thing	something she disliked but afterwards martin said he was sorry.	5.935839558731743
18895. he apologized so sweetly i couldn't keep being annoyed with	him.	4.467047448170571
18896. it wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time;	he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened	which was as honest as he could put it.	4.944072446712913
18897. but his mother told the	story over and over till her martin said he was sorry was as	much a part of her as the shape of her thin pallid ears.	4.363170648144251
18898. the	battle had to be fought.	9.807160102066325
18899. let the best sex win.	7.47991211085289
18900. but his resolution	hardly seemed to help.	8.889635966221869
18901. if the situation had been bad it now got	worse.	5.310629285395308
18902. about this time people began dropping in considering	that the newly married had been left alone long enough.	5.714375344125654
18903. angrily martin	wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip- preferably	one that lasted months- instead of deciding not to postpone the date	until he could get away.	3.393669244705176
18904. here they were at the mercy of anyone who	chose to come by.	7.421882382785223
18905. these stray people nearly always insisted on dolores	showing them around the apartment.	4.284888111986323
18906. of course the tours of inspection	included the ever-present shorts.	7.85579980221598
18907. it was curious how the	different visitors took this.	5.283501481322339
18908. some tried to ignore the blot on the bedroom's	countenance.	6.667120517548874
18909. to them	all dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale.	4.867892606213462
18910. it's a little	contest martin and i have she would begin gaily carrying	the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course.	5.515858488690396
18911. while he waited	in the living room.	6.6001393340105485
18912. they entered the	bedroom and dolores said nothing.	7.266403953614761
18913. then one of the guests showed his	merriment.	7.694029767221523
18914. you were in a hurry weren't you?	8.638207754683073
18915.  martin would	have liked to break the man's neck.	5.103342539806428
18916. dolores smiled; she let the	interpretation stand.	7.163184125958424
18917. now martin heard himself give a snort of mock	good nature.	4.782724544520212
18918. with her eyes dolores dared him for the truth ready to	begin: it's a little contest-   never again did he	enter into the ritual of showing the apartment.	4.87779738686569
18919. they kept up a	rigid pretense of speaking relations.	5.004446092747742
18920. but martin seldom felt the impulse	to talk about anything.	6.60434795749222
18921. what to talk about?	8.19843702353691
18922.    dolores kept	picking up any of his clothes which he left	about but he had been robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions.	5.767480298869278
18923. he fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets	so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers.	3.8043150707462297
18924. in his moments of worst agony martin	imagined what his friends were saying.	6.34702231594264
18925. the sound of their amazement.	5.850177257749175
18926. bizarre: he could hear the word.	7.163184125958424
18927. we were up to visit them and h   he had thought her exactly	what he wanted.	4.3063865970925495
18928. six weeks of marriage and i'm using the past tense	he told himself furiously.	6.016877014817958
18929. pursuing his idea he saw that it would	be impossible to leave her now.	3.993254795700849
18930. everyone would know why; he would	cut a supremely ridiculous figure.	6.461973478142371
18931. day	and night martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made	for himself.	3.8101576301595865
18932. his mind scurried frantically seeking an exit.	7.0636974910397266
18933. alternately	he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly	morosely to live out his life in this fashion.	3.8638510119790728
18934. nothing would	change nothing would ever change.	8.261139943266176
18935. when the solution finally	came to him one night while he was in bed he was so shaken by its simplicity	that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before.	4.13567977228336
18936. in a frenzy of excitement he considered his plan.	7.139708641036663
18937. beside his shorts he would place something of hers.	4.477601198394805
18938. instantaneously	he would have won an immeasurable moral victory for if she picked	up say a pair of her panties she might just as well lift his	shorts lying alongside- the expenditure of energy was almost the same.	4.5837169806951525
18939. he felt that it would be a particular humiliation to dolores to pick	up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor.	4.88445049461493
18940. furthermore	he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly: every time he went	in the bedroom he could drop a slip or a brassiere or maybe a girdle	next to his shorts.	4.507841974446781
18941. sooner or later dolores would crack.	5.6364348302263805
18942. on the	other hand if she didn't remove her own things it would be difficult	to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the apartment.	5.686823549578944
18943. martin guessed that dolores would not be so eager to tell the	next installment of her story.	4.474546458996362
18944. the tale he thought would become less	gay.	5.874347790377797
18945. she had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness	his lack of control his general male looseness while she	remained cool airy and untouched the charming teacher who disciplined	an unruly body.	3.4263304626930537
18946. to have her underclothes linked with his on the floor	would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd.	5.367705454435687
18947. something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence	of the plan lay in his faith that the idea would work because he believed	in it since his courage and virility were involved because it	was truly his.	3.6758995603809033
18948. the knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death	and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted	fanaticism.	4.769779960426356
18949. the next morning while dolores was out of	the room he went to her bureau drawer took out a pair of nylon lace	pants and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts.	3.6595401262041167
18950. he sat down on	the bed.	8.259677019319643
18951. in a surprisingly short time dolores appeared.	5.867168461307319
18952. to	his delight her eyes focused at once upon the two garments.	5.739974350684024
18953. slowly and	deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers	then hesitated for about a second.	3.779521903998379
18954. ah he thought she's going through	the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well	pick up my shorts too.	4.807873378411027
18955. he saw that in a moment she had grasped all the	implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him.	4.27056296859418
18956. extending	her fingers another inch she caught up the shorts and swiftly	left the room.	5.448482501884564
18957. she did not look at him but he noticed that her face	was flushed and her eyes unsteady.	4.063019623220434
18958. they breakfasted together	but martin did not refer to his triumph and dolores found a great	deal to do in the kitchen bobbing up and down from the table so that	talk was impossible.	5.516463833651265
18959. well martin thought that'll save.	6.877390903555252
18960. he left	for work in high spirits.	7.5139871259533155
18961. as he relaxed that day martin realized	how tense he had been these past weeks.	5.052245014481831
18962. he found that he no longer	hated dolores and he was	surprised at a resurgence of an affectionate feeling.	5.255975625117422
18963. good old a-z cap said.	6.733218500649599
18964. you know i've got	one of your cars at home.	7.693197193916958
18965. as a prominent industrialist you ought to	be interested in his nibs' support group.	4.496755501743769
18966. isn't his racket down	your alley?	7.712079578137997
18967.    once it was william thought.	6.950339253428898
18968. a rush of memory swept him back and he forgot cap.	5.912735717700236
18969. how did he start on such a ride to brief glory?	5.248474909555992
18970.  simply enough	through the inadvertent agency of his brother-in-law.	6.951384253567268
18971. general hershey's	draft and doc eddyman and cap were responsible for his first	eminence but fearless freddy bryan could take credit if he cared	to for the second time.	3.5558129437564086
18972. freddy needed a job having been	detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper	financing by gerry and it was up to arthur willis to provide him	with one.	4.834130869237922
18973. mr willis bought zenith plastic products a	skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and	whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on long	island engaged in working out government contracts and installed freddy	in an executive position.	3.436766103391111
18974. shortly after freddy had his usual	proliferation of bold ideas.	6.821355655600938
18975. willis listened patiently and once in a	while william was exposed to them at a family gathering; he generally	heard freddy's suggestions without interest being absorbed by	his own prospering concerns.	3.4093496570499813
18976. probably mr willis was influenced	toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for	his grandchildren.	5.561371051228369
18977. gerry began to aid freddy with her father prodded	no doubt by joan's open contempt for freddy and william's irritating	competency.	3.7366839897503725
18978. another factor must have been the eventual disposal	of willis' fortune; she unquestionably assumed that the more	he was entwined with freddy the more likely he was to reward freddy	richly upon his death.	5.300869586057008
18979. whatever the reasons willis and bryan	started expanding zenith.	5.740691580340557
18980. they acquired another electronics factory	a specialized ceramics company an organization that built- very	experimentally- high-speed research calculators.	5.4539805652091315
18981. since they were	hunting for national defense contracts adam herberet a man of surprising	resources entered the combination as a silent partner because	of his political connections.	3.8607456309269246
18982. feeling his power freddy looked	for additional worlds to conquer.	6.144814417540349
18983. heavy industry slanted toward inexhaustible	government coffers attracted him.	4.6724501027054846
18984. the allstates auto	company a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles	and other off-road equipment had recently constructed an over-large	modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism.	4.4287401272914035
18985. cursed with a shaky	management and dissatisfied stockholders it was ripe for amalgamation	and freddy's instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and	small expenditure of cash and never mind inevitable consequences.	3.2653762695140407
18986. with	herberet's blessing he was convinced that allstates' wisconsin	folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly tanks	missiles or ordnance of some kind.	4.901230461255919
18987. at that point william	came into the picture.	6.238226514151639
18988. although not much desiring the account he had	been appointed advertising head of zenith.	6.117116929666015
18989. freed of routine by having	his own firm and a complaisant partner his work in new york had	given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate	structure; and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he	did he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities.	3.3924238049355195
18990. mr willis eager to have him allied with the family wanted advice	beyond the confines of his field and william set out on a serious	study of the situation including trips to wisconsin and washington.	4.927567704249598
18991. in the end he said: i'm not enchanted by the proposition	sir.	5.310220425547531
18992. i know a guy named jack hamrick a very bright young	engineer who was with chrysler and i took him with me to allstates.	5.404517508423036
18993. it's his expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what	you have in mind.	4.0288505950796365
18994. the conversion will cost a fortune.	6.237449906268207
18995. besides that	i'm acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through	my contacts in the air force.	4.654566156199904
18996. i think adam herberet is guilty	of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than	on the technical side.	5.516268100578207
18997. missiles have thrown everything up for grabs	and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here.	4.601701793732732
18998. the future of manned	aircraft is in doubt which affects government procurement and jet	transports have revolutionized the airline trade- one jet can take	the place of three compound-engine planes.	4.639414697032491
18999. this means the aircraft companies	are going to tear into the government market looking for anything	they can get and making the competition tough.	3.9262103810178193
19000. here are a few facts	and figures i've assembled.	8.626556526313157
19001. can't you stay with what you have	and wait till the dust settles?	4.0683852436856025
19002.    willis glanced at the bound	pages given him and shrugged.	6.144814417540349
19003. well he said there is freddy	you know h.	5.728239682915318
19004. freddy is deeply committed to our	plans already.	6.743273855772659
19005. he assures me he has people to handle the money raising	and ham richert my lawyer says the legal aspects of the wedding	of zenith and allstates are no problem.	3.54664504022379
19006. i don't like to exhibit	the deadly dampening effect of an elderly man's caution.	5.973627304286199
19007. i wish you wouldn't tell freddy i'm	lukewarm; i've caused him trouble before and he's beginning	to resent me.	3.9917476392902524
19008. if we don't take care the sisters will be entering the	fray on opposite sides brandishing their cudgels.	5.72279526723131
19009. which	is a frightful prospect bill.	5.619635421798327
19010. one shouldn't	mix commercial affairs with patriarchy but in this case i have	no choice h.	6.549937746344118
19011. let me think about it.	7.402857396059938
19012. i'm most grateful to you so	grateful i wish you were my principal aide instead of freddy.	5.190914845849578
19013. not to william's surprise freddy adam and hamilton richert	prevailed; allied to them was gerry devoting much time to swaying	her father and joan dismissed all thought of the project and william	was unwilling to interfere further.	3.740940311947161
19014. zenith absorbed allstates	stock transfers were arranged and freddy became president of the hyphenated	combination.	6.321057899870418
19015. through jack hamrick william fell into the	world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for shoals and	clay.	3.93190817449246
19016. he forgot about a-z till unhappily he and hamrick	were proved correct.	5.925879823256658
19017. freddy's backing dropped away from him	and mr willis was forced to make up the deficit.	4.386473484708753
19018. adam beset by	changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the	new corporation couldn't deliver from his end.	5.6538304648294675
19019. the wisconsin plant	turned out to be a white elephant.	5.36915945893258
19020. stock willis held in abundance	fell sharply in value.	6.954485155244645
19021. confronted by a grim future freddy lost his	nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation.	3.9831229374674355
19022. once more willis	summoned william.	11.549920696024088
19023. you were right he said- you and your	engineer- and i'm in something of a bind.	4.529410728175843
19024. freddy's solution	doesn't appeal to me.	7.712079578137997
19025. in addition to other defects i'm a stubborn	man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment.	4.072219211166434
19026. will you see if you can help me?	8.828030266768836
19027.    william spent a long	week end closeted with hamrick.	5.276074887025402
19028. his recent experience in motor car advertising	a love for cars of themselves the existence of a-z's	useless wisconsin set-up exposure to exciting conceptions of hamrick's	that nobody would buy and the coincidental recent failure	of a respected but out-dated small-car manufacturer called ticonderoga	motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid	to broach it.	4.333350205525404
19029. initially hamrick's reaction to a-z going	into the passenger car market was discouraging.	4.095264093551901
19030. he thought the financing	the advertising the production of new models the founding of	a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult.	5.430432499760316
19031. if a-z could buy ticonderoga cheaply and use their	presses and dies and other equipment if william could hit precisely	the right promotion note if the money hurdle was not insurmountable	h.	3.493517729001159
19032. they took nearly a month to investigate marshal statistics	and put their arguments down in black and white.	5.258957373901256
19033. taking hamrick	with him william went to mr willis.	5.228777641252158
19034. he was surprised and dubious	but impressed by the engineer and the report.	6.986611334527104
19035. your alternative	is breathtaking he said and i'm frank in saying	a bit mad.	4.871099301140815
19036. i wish i was younger and less timid h.	6.881467054899731
19037. well i can't	resolve this myself.	6.877390903555252
19038. i'll have to call in the brain trust.	6.7332945370440545
19039. are you	willing to run the gantlet?	6.780167381212435
19040.  i can't guarantee you a sympathetic	audience.	7.95751090267089
19041. we'll be in there swinging william said	but in a way sir you've got to decide it yourself.	4.152876462199693
19042. you have	the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours-	and besides nobody else is going to have the courage.	6.902616958770324
19043. if they follow	anyone it'll have to be you.	7.125348025917969
19044. i should explain:	there's more here for me than advocating my little dream there's	you.	6.071450186560696
19045. you mustn't take a fall or publicly back away.	5.363167735900659
19046. you're- you're arthur willis h.	7.712079578137997
19047. forgive the hearts and	flowers theme.	5.619635421798327
19048. i rather like the music willis replied	quietly.	7.925278570055527
19049. at the meeting attended by freddy	richert herberet and the a-z executive staff with	mr willis presiding william and hamrick did indeed run the gantlet.	3.7721785132916237
19050. from shock and incredulity most of the listeners went on to open	resistance and animosity.	7.4567571514186906
19051. oh my god ham richert	said a little child shall lead them.	4.55432891912845
19052. it's absurd bill freddy said from a pale face.	6.144814417540349
19053. you're leading dad down the garden path.	4.913686410369733
19054. your	garden	god damn it! william said.	7.712079578137997
19055. i don't enjoy family	quarrels adam said.	5.79847623263147
19056. we're here to	transact business.	8.457718703298294
19057. can't we put an end to this arthur?	5.435118914645477
19058. 	hear me out please william begged.	7.163184125958424
19059. i'm an advertising	hustler i admit but i have to get hot once in a larger sphere.	4.655809269862813
19060. sure ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the big	three.	5.810836602152999
19061. their cars weren't small enough they didn't have the	power they were old-fashioned.	4.350787650373838
19062. they tried to sell 'em on economy and	simple merit.	6.546767745283227
19063. we've arrived at an age for romance and snobbery.	4.477601198394805
19064. we've all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age.	5.448482501884564
19065. look what those little european jobs are doing.	5.408299377989354
19066. we'll woo the	consumer with a product not bludgeon him with chromed excess length	and weight.	5.331440467598945
19067. let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and	a seduction at reasonable rates.	3.8101576301595865
19068. ticonderoga folded a few minutes too	soon before the tide changed still honest and stupid- and the network	of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again-	waiting for us ready-made.	4.637880968329211
19069. we've got rid of the steam yachts	and georgian houses and the bloated too-expensive automobile is	next.	3.8101576301595865
19070. why not come down smartly in the world in a chic fashion with	an allstates-zenith?	7.684686128713657
19071.    he swayed them somewhat but the	debate raged on.	4.862373123883983
19072. financing emerged as the main obstacle.	7.576195489810648
19073. mr willis	made it evident that he had contributed his maximum.	5.5210211147021
19074. nobody	will underwrite it i'm telling you freddy said.	6.412214371980113
19075. i know	what i'm talking about in that department.	5.3252568544725785
19076. there's	plenty of risk money ham richert added but not for anything	this risky.	5.764768621839715
19077. we'll	try to swing the deal on that basis.	4.6724501027054846
19078. if we can't raise the capital	we're through.	8.537425392165602
19079. you're up against it anyhow.	5.619635421798327
19080. why won't you give me a chance?	8.288616633881174
19081.    a silence fell.	6.80380839614823
19082. heads instinctively turned in willis' direction.	7.163184125958424
19083. he smiled at william	and slowly rubbed his hands together.	4.645344995261077
19084. i feel i must	answer the question he said since the onus later if any should	fall on me- i don't relish recriminations spread broadcast outside	my family h.	4.943262750010353
19085. i'm not giving you a chance bill but availing	myself of your generous offer of assistance.	3.8693473374394047
19086. all the in-laws have got to have their day adam said and	glared at william and freddy in turn.	5.593814347699732
19087. sweat started out on	william's forehead whether from relief or disquietude he could not	tell.	3.9701983041559052
19088. across the table hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled	thumb and forefinger.	5.993272494656947
19089. spike-haired	burly red-faced decked with horn-rimmed glasses and an ivy	league suit jack hamrick awaited william at the officers' club.	3.632711015013689
19090. hello boss he said and grinned.	8.30295994798883
19091. i suppose i can never	expect to call you 'general' after that washington episode.	4.419898486964929
19092. it was among these that hinkle identified a photograph of barco!	for it seems that barco fancying himself a ladies' man	had listed himself for mormon beard roles	at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said: with	your beard dear you ought to be in movies!   mills	secured barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge rushed to	the hollywood police station to report the theft and less than five	minutes later detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail	of cal barco.	4.472862038451427
19093. on their way they stopped at every gas station	along the main boulevards to question the attendants.	4.259817545974299
19094. finally at ye	olde gasse filling station on avocado avenue they learned that	their man having paused to get oil for his car had asked about the	route to san diego.	4.756699714683706
19095. they headed in that direction and at san juan	capistrano by-the-sea came upon barco sitting in the quaint old	spanish mission drive-in eating a hot tamale.	3.598539117245429
19096. at the moment barco's	back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in	on his convertible which in their quest for the stolen lap rug they	proceeded to search.	5.157797890713004
19097. the robe however was missing for by that time	barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in glendale.	3.4924695101321506
19098. the detectives	placed barco under arrest and without informing him of the	nature of the charge took him back to hollywood for questioning.	4.74239349587745
19099. thus it was that barco apprehended for mere larceny now began	to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered.	4.113746073279346
19100. during	the return trip barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless	phrases such as: they're under sand dunes h they're better	off i tell you h i saved their souls.	4.723687752671224
19101. the detective commenting	on barco's behavior felt that he merely belonged among the myriad	citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged- that he was	a more or less harmless nut!   however while in his cell	awaiting trial for theft barco in a fit of apprehension made an	attempt to take his own life.	3.0790700155890773
19102. the attempt had failed because when	endeavoring to cut his wrists this murderer of seven women had fainted	at the sight of blood.	4.744250699695205
19103. the jail authorities- attaching no particular	significance to the episode- offered barco whisky to revive him;	but the old fellow a lifelong teetotaler refused it and no more	was thought of the matter.	3.2476504135341266
19104. then it was that district attorney	welch entered the case.	7.743861978701681
19105. a man of vaulting ambition with one eye	on the mayorship of los angeles nothing ever escaped him which might	possibly lead to personal publicity.	3.8959508145337214
19106. it was reported to welch's	office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide.	6.523189533029146
19107. welch	wanted to know why.	6.162967476035402
19108. now welch had a pet theory that	everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at.	5.338262550206045
19109. the suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory	to the test.	3.8918144858081813
19110. so he paid a call on barco in his cell and began their	chat by stating bluntly:   barco we've got the goods	on you! it'll be a lot better if you come clean.	4.798518562464026
19111. at	first barco was evasive and shifty.	5.265281678710789
19112. but with welch's relentless pursuit	of the subject barco finally broke and started confessing	to one murder after another.	5.645682155615123
19113. by the time barco reached the count	of three the situation seemed to welch almost too good to be true.	4.431084804191401
19114. but	if true it was the case of which he had dreamed the case which would	throw him into headlines all over america as the hero of a great	murder trial.	5.995632193787417
19115. welch summoned jail officials to barco's cell.	4.913686410369733
19116. but to welch's chagrin the police captain pooh-poohed welch's	credulity in barco's confession.	6.466347781056535
19117. barco was clearly a nut.	5.619635421798327
19118. it required strength bravado daring to commit murder.	7.416808920208372
19119. that worm	a murderer?	8.701286958147561
19120.  ridiculous! then for the first time since his	arrest a glint of spirit lit barco's eyes.	6.489921696704747
19121. his manhood had been attacked.	5.949600585200961
19122. he stiffened and rose to his feet.	7.042834174643505
19123. he'd show them!	is that so?	5.619635421798327
19124.  he queried.	12.081077223713681
19125. well for ten years i've been	murdering women.	6.565805004885356
19126. i can lead you to every one of the bodies and there	ain't four nor five nor six of 'em- there's	seven!	the next day the police captain in derision organized what	he termed welch's wild goose chase.	5.148697205519194
19127. for indeed it seemed	incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and	not get caught at it even in hollywood.	3.8067356708727154
19128. the searching party consisted	of the police captain welch barco policemen with shovels newspaper	reporters and cameramen.	4.827508206929211
19129. barco his state of apprehension	gone never to return had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained	his principal attitude from that time on.	3.845915836585741
19130. he directed the cortege	of autos to the sand dunes near santa monica.	5.822623424591575
19131. stopping the cars at	a fork in the road he got out paced off a certain distance to a spot	between two shrub-covered sand hills and indicated a location.	3.3277242066172517
19132. orders were given to dig.	7.712079578137997
19133. welch was worried.	6.939425769494729
19134. the newspaper boys cracked jokes and again	barco's pride was aroused.	5.315929595247935
19135. with greater precision he again paced	off a location this time a little more to the left.	4.727783251276181
19136. with	quibs and gibes the policemen again started digging.	6.412214371980113
19137. the captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when	finally one of the shovels struck an object.	4.567594268665486
19138. there's something	here! said the digger.	7.712079578137997
19139. joking stopped and everyone gathered	around.	5.619635421798327
19140. the digger thrusting about with his shovel now raised into	view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderer's hollywood	sport shirts.	5.1598889818542695
19141. although it was a mere fragment of the victim's remains	it was enough.	5.673988665076456
19142. welch was wild with delight.	7.712079578137997
19143. his elation grew	as barco's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another.	4.091954992896453
19144. now did welch truly become the man of the hour and everything	that followed in the procedure of justice was a new triumph	for	him.	5.328680518621531
19145. it went to his head and his ambition increased.	5.678516744697136
19146. it was	apparent that welch was in cahoots with marshall and would use his power	as da to drag every possible sensation into the case.	4.999270128308673
19147. every	new scandal which would provide more copy for marshall's	pen would thus mean more publicity for welch.	3.744109221929566
19148. i knew that both	these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when	viola was called to the stand.	5.754850619335689
19149. once there the da with devilish	cleverness would provide marshall with headlines: viola's	multiple romancesh viola lake an addicth downfall	of another film idol! it would be fine publicity for the	man who was willing to walk to the mayor's throne over the broken	reputation of a helpless girl!   i studied welch closely as	the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how	he might be thwarted.	3.1887288092570842
19150. it wasn't long before i sensed that there was	something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for	viola's destruction.	5.318219390158657
19151. he was bitter and resentful toward her personally	resentful.	5.401752651115104
19152. a dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps	he had entertained aspirations toward viola's favors- or even	more serious perhaps that he had attained a share of them and had	then been superseded by some luckier chap.	4.894591013608668
19153. i did not rest until i had	tracked the mystery down.	5.260184834950472
19154. one day over a	year before there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown	hotel.	6.742496945538986
19155. viola had been urged to attend by telephone and not knowing	the host or the character of the party she had gone.	4.234042393478744
19156. she arrived	late and as she entered the party noted that gentlemen seemed to be	in the majority; the air was thick with smoke empty bottles were	in evidence and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor.	4.645530704346241
19157. naturally viola had no wish to remain but she felt she	couldn't leave so soon after her arrival in all politeness to her	host.	3.649783918455197
19158. and it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken	refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds;	while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which	as fate would have it belonged to district attorney welch.	4.777429645719733
19159. as viola sat there a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes	and socks from the unidentified feet and as a prank insert rosebuds	between the toes.	3.7722157883945546
19160. a little later the district attorney woke	up emerged from under the couch looked at his watch and realized	he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the culture	forum on the civic spirit of the southland in the byzantine	room of the hotel where his wife as president of the forum was	to preside.	4.794395934848129
19161. he made his way to his host's bedroom where he carefully	brushed himself off neatly arranged his hair and painstakingly selected	his hat from the many on the bed.	3.9559678853136577
19162. then noting neither the absence	of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds he made his way	to the byzantine room and with his usual dignity mounted the rostrum.	5.235850776700384
19163. the effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined.	4.660034494056997
19164. the incident aside from reflecting on welch's political	career had all but wrecked his home life.	4.827484701178731
19165. he never rested until	he discovered who the culprit was and when he did he vowed vengeance	on viola lake if ever the chance came his way.	3.6502575180383254
19166. and here it was!	by such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in	motion.	5.8713808067072994
19167. during these first days of the trial i didn't have	as much time to commiserate with viola as i should have liked.	4.5157833962025835
19168. in the	first place it was difficult for us to meet.	7.4087818768921725
19169. we couldn't be seen	together for the tongue of scandal was ever ready to link our names	and the tongue of scandal finds but one thing to say of the association	of a man with a girl no matter how innocent.	3.650892667494077
19170. i couldn't invite	viola to our house for mother snobbishly refused to receive her.	5.796167530887522
19171. now the czarship had not affected my own sense of social values	but mother had attained a reflected glory through it which had	opened the doors of los angeles-pasadena society to her.	3.63321146568655
19172. there mother	was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated	by the budweisers the chalmers	and the heinzes	.	6.003040365406653
19173. i hated being dragged into the salons of these	aristocrats.	4.85486375821358
19174. but mother insisted for it is seldom indeed that anyone	remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive	midsts.	5.662007336482687
19175. in fact it was not until the king of spain had visited	at pickfair that mary and doug were beckoned to cross the sacred	barriers which separate los angeles and pasadena from the hoi-polloi.	4.098776260457326
19176. mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial	opportunities with pasadena debs who had been educated abroad and	with those of the more lenient los angeles area where a debutante was	a girl who had been to high school.	5.390683953574024
19177. but at long last came a time when	i broke away from mother and her society chi-chi in order	to spend a cosy evening with viola and her chaperon at her home.	3.491211528091898
19178. however such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial that	every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered	to the world society and even alas to my own mother.	5.312932419752316
19179. when i arrived at viola's	i was shown to my surprise into the kitchen.	4.859283976255988
19180. viola greeted me in checked apron ladle in hand and explained	it was the cook's night out and that she herself was preparing	dinner.	5.056277462196697
19181. i sat and watched proceedings.	6.316170410054584
19182. there was to be roast	chicken with dressing giblet gravy asparagus new peas with a sprig	of mint creamed onions and mashed potatoes- all chosen prepared	and cooked by viola herself.	5.3314762213000275
19183. i realized that hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem	but his agony could have been no greater.	4.402127811340791
19184. the most that was accomplished	was adding mrs beige's tray to the dish pile and by means	of repeated threats on an ascending scale seeing that the girls dressed	themselves after a fashion.	4.622662695572933
19185. i was saved from making the	decision as the phone rang and the girls were upon me instantly.	4.2331484595314794
19186. here's	a household hint: if you can't find your children and get tired	of calling them pick up the phone.	5.440707252776867
19187. no matter if your children are	at the movies in school visiting their grandmother or on a field	trip in some distant city they will be upon you magically within seconds	after you pick up the phone.	3.776042486469626
19188. jennie and miranda twined themselves	around me murmuring endearments.	6.412214371980113
19189. louise climbed onto a stool	and clutched the hand with which i was trying to hold the phone claiming	my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency.	3.5573542417676287
19190. somehow	managing to get out a cool poised won't you hold on a second	please i covered up the mouthpiece and with more warmth and less	poise gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment mostly the latter	including devil's island and the remoter reaches of siberia.	4.494090841413273
19191. i promised to illustrate the lecture if they so much as breathed	till after the call was completed.	4.277544267816884
19192. speaking into the phone	again and recognizing the caller i resumed my everyday voice.	5.782608219248053
19193. soon	we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little	things like jennie's holding her breath and pretending to black	out miranda's dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table	and various screeches thuds and giggles.	3.1460513718935705
19194. under the circumstances	i had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone but when	i hung up i was reasonably certain that francesca had wanted to	remind me of our town meeting the next evening and how important it	was that hank and i be there.	4.568227092403413
19195. i discovered that the girls had	shrewdly vacated the kitchen and were playing quietly in the living	room.	4.2155268695737
19196. it seemed that i would be the gainer if i accepted the peace	and quiet instead of carrying out my threats.	6.251512009552428
19197. resolving to get	something done i started in on the dishes.	4.866322063551361
19198. i'm not saying	it right.	8.773104921165439
19199. what i meant to say was that i started to start in on the	dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink.	4.050388424595688
19200. they looked	so formidable however so demanding that i found myself staring	at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again this time about	francesca and her husband.	5.019667492608067
19201. how about them i thought.	7.3762982781075905
19202. francesca	and herbert were among the few people we knew in catatonia.	6.131955563316308
19203. we didn't even know them till about a month after we moved- at that	time they had called on us after i met fran at a pta meeting	and had taken us in hand socially.	3.339849024106979
19204. they had been kind to us and	we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners and for information	as to where to shop which dentist doctor plumber and sitter	to call	just a village; the yellow pages of the telephone book were amazingly	.	4.944838223846361
19205. herb an expert on narrow	ties thin lapels and swatches was men's fashion editor of parvenu	the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation.	3.532989701196562
19206. fran	and he had met about two years after she had arrived in manhattan from	nebraska or was it wyoming?	5.3843684840778945
19207.  she was the daughter and sole heiress	of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and having arrived	in new york with a big bank roll became a dabbler in various fields.	3.6246161516047914
19208. she patronized greenwich village artists for awhile then put some	money into a broadway show which was successful.	5.3425637946163596
19209. it was during her writing period that she and herb	met and decided that they were in love.	4.618932890382599
19210. they were married at a lavish	ceremony which was duly recorded in parvenu and all other magazines	and newspapers and then they honeymooned in bermuda.	5.057762808843929
19211. bermuda was not in style that year.	5.698934840064004
19212. they had honeymooned in	rome; everyone was very high on rome that year.	6.464017181447102
19213. they had bought	their house in catatonia after investigating all the regions of	suburbia surrounding new york; they had chosen catatonia because	of its reputation for excellent schools beaches and abundance of names.	3.4984097711453623
19214. you are bound to get involved with people when you have	children fran had told me at our first meeting so it is good	to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little	housewives and dull husbands but people who do things.	4.597086525145686
19215. i admired their easy way of doing things but i couldn't escape	an uneasiness at their way of always doing the right things.	3.691370104719211
19216. their house was a centuries-old colonial which they had had restored	and updated and added on to.	5.661842306368465
19217. it had	a gourmet's corner a breakfast room a luncheon	room a dining room a sitting room a room for standing up a	party room dressing rooms for everybody even a room for mud.	3.4396880955121794
19218. it was	all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children	would color in the coloring room paint in the painting room play	with	blocks in the block house and do all the other things in the proper	rooms at exactly the right time.	4.804746434988105
19219. their two boys were well adjusted	and like their parents always did the right thing at the right	time and damn the consequences.	3.6569949150618366
19220. francesca and herbert considered	themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were	by filling their colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings	and other art objects	.	4.67288338831304
19221. fran flaunted her independence by rebelling against	the catatonia uniform of bermuda shorts and knee-length socks by	wearing bermuda shorts and knee-length socks in color; bright	pinks and plaids and vivid stripes.	3.2847726970144535
19222. sometimes she even wore the uniform	in solid unrelieved black and with her blonde hair cut so closely	wearing this uniform she strongly resembled a member of the	ss.	5.353752376557649
19223. no one could dislike them i thought.	6.1395198697050875
19224. sometimes though they	did not seem quite human.	7.7285020843907235
19225. it seemed indeed that their house was	not so much a home but rather a perfect stage set and that they were	actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play and had talent	enough to fill the roles competently with nice understatement.	3.658715695959382
19226. practically	the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing	names; even brand names.	5.615529427197867
19227. you should hear the reverence in	fran's voice when she said baccarat or steuben or madame	alexander.	4.572929292112728
19228. she always let it be known that there was wine	in the pot roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy and	that koussevitzky's second cousin was an intimate of theirs.	4.888411395631165
19229. i wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not	for my fear that all the other inhabitants of catatonia were equally	unreal.	3.911835048027527
19230. i couldn't feel at home among them.	7.822917008652704
19231. besides francesca	there was blanche.	7.268274365931273
19232. francesca was pleasant and charming but blanche	was sweet.	6.412214371980113
19233. yes blanche was very very sweet- being in her company	was like being drowned in warm melted marshmallows.	3.9887027916949966
19234. i had once been	a witness when blanche had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness	oh my souffle has collapsed.	5.598327080040726
19235. anyone knows how a real	red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe! if blanche	had been honest she would have yelled slammed at least a couple of	doors and thrown a few little valueless things.	3.6050821749628827
19236. but dear me no;	not blanche.	8.558806346535226
19237. after five minutes with blanche one might welcome	the astringency	of grazie who was a sort of gwen cafritz to francesca's	perle mesta.	4.203453656687218
19238. francesca and grazie were habitual committee	chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen equal	bosses of whatever pta or civic project was being launched.	4.67288338831304
19239. they	were inseparable not because they were fond of each other but because	they wanted to keep an eye on each other as they were keen rivals	for social leadership.	3.8982559206099285
19240. grazie was mean: quietly mean and bitterly	unfunnily sarcastic.	6.412214371980113
19241. she it was who had looked to see if i was	wearing shoes upon learning that i couldn't drive.	3.992509479955744
19242. grazie had a small	slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast.	5.4716123135994605
19243. she lived in an ultra-modern house whose decoration appointments paint	and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring; the pets	were a couple of siamese cats.	3.794988068942637
19244. her uniform was of rich raw silk in	a shade which matched her hair skin housepaint and cats and since	she was so thin as to be almost shapeless she rather resembled a frozen	fish stick.	4.783817406196701
19245. the husbands of these women and others i had	met in catatonia were distinguished only in that they were to me at	least indistinguishable.	3.7380638052313535
19246. i couldn't tell one from the other.	8.226472388007052
19247. like	herbert they were all in communications: radio television magazines	and advertising.	4.317068102383446
19248. one or two were writers of books; all were fellows	of finite charm.	6.852683811125519
19249. each had developed a hair-trigger chuckle and	the habit of saying zounds! in deference to country-squirehood.	4.164514088774305
19250. i never thought i'd live to hear people chuckle and say zounds!	in real life.	5.997697513817343
19251. i wouldn't have missed it for anything.	5.406629921006237
19252. they	were sincere- men of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent	smile.	6.746939384436462
19253. these boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently	pressing one of his hands in both of theirs while they gazed misty-eyed	with care into the eyes of the person they were meeting.	3.9900970455845073
19254. could such	unadulterated love for a total stranger be credited?	6.805415252504191
19255.  they were	always leaping to light cigarettes open car doors fill plates or glasses	and i mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that	i mistrusted bake shops that called themselves sanitary bake shops.	3.6442850974688548
19256. o pioneers! i thought and wondered what	kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban	frontier; pioneers who looked like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher	conferences and who never called the school principal mister.	4.635012561549724
19257. i sighed thinking that among other things people here seemed	to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $85000	yearly; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get	on person to person; people who thought it was nice to be important	but not important to be nice; who were more ingratiating than	gracious more personalities than persons.	3.6661746290636863
19258. in my estimation they	were people who read daphne du maurier and discussed kafka; well	not discussed him exactly but said kafka! reverently	and raised their eyes as if they were at a loss to describe how they	felt about kafka which they were because they had no opinions about	kafka not having read kafka.	5.003042017744418
19259. they were i felt people invariably	trying to prove not who but what they were and trying to determine	what not who others were.	3.9643001339947115
19260. becoming aware that it was nearly	lunchtime i brought myself back to the tasks at hand.	6.610761620404892
19261. i made plans	for the afternoon- doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at	once making the beds and then maybe painting the kitchen.	3.6109016184547382
19262. then i	remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every day for the	last week.	5.975170513750754
19263. bananas! jennie had shouted each time.	5.219666477665999
19264. they're	not dessert! they're not even food.	7.163184125958424
19265. they're just something	you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast.	4.932007335781926
19266. i dug around	and found a mix and was able to surprise them with a devil's-food	cake with chocolate icing.	6.114144479559507
19267. rule for cooking: if you can't put garlic in it put chocolate in	the cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence	in itself of the dearth of taste thrills mama had been providing.	3.215639410452783
19268. then jennie closed her eyes stretched forth her arms and said:	take my hand louise; i'm a stranger in paradise.	5.1764004292255565
19269. needless to say i was furious at this unparalleled intrusion	upon free enterprise.	4.413028501397827
19270. how dared they demand to snoop in private	financial records disbursements confidential contracts and agreements?	5.865904682118589
19271. 	it is as though i said on the historic three-hour coast-to-coast	radio broadcast which i bought	and pre-empting the eddie cantor manhattan merry-go-round and	that man in the white house like some despot	of yore insisted on reading my diary raiding my larder and ransacking	my lingerie! my impassioned plea for civil rights created	a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider	replacing the eddie cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis.	3.1782129499746232
19272. but	what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator	who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great	nation?	5.084855442373333
19273.  the savage barbarian hordes of red russian communism descended	on the athens that was mighty metronome sacking and despoiling	with their bolshevistic battle cry of soak the rich'! after	an unspeakable siege lasting the better part of two months it was	announced that the studio owed the government a tax debt in excess	of eight million dollars while i who had always remained aloof from	such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary i had earned	and the little i legally inherited as morris' helpless relict	was stung with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions	as to wipe out all but a fraction of my poor hard-come-by savings.	2.897235537483595
19274. i was also publicly reprimanded dragged through the mud by the	radical press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications as	the new republic the new yorker time and the christian	science monitor.	5.04352588951912
19275. it was then that i availed myself of the	rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional.	3.9683567684880128
19276. the	litigation was costly and seemingly endless.	7.163184125958424
19277. i fought like a tigress	but by the time i appealed my case to the supreme court	mr roosevelt and his henchmen had done their dirty work	all too well even going so far as to attempt to pack the highest	tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me.	3.690594951034873
19278. presidential	coercion had succeeded not only in poisoning the courtiers toadies	and sycophants of the bench against me but it had been so far-reaching	as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing	me! i was ready like portia to present my own brief.	4.924743600061932
19279. but the	supreme court wouldn't even hear my case! my plea was unanimously	voted down and thrown out.	3.9238037088949635
19280. again my name was on all the	front pages.	7.3697957659663365
19281. i was it seemed persona non grata in every quarter	but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers	and students of jurisprudence.	3.7319506579890853
19282. as charles evans hughes said	miss poitrine's limitations as an actress are exceeded only by	her logic as a litigant.	5.302779228610915
19283. albert einstein was quoted as saying:	the workings of the woman's mind amaze me.	4.0077056035706535
19284. henry ford spoke	of me as utterly astounding.	7.502229479134751
19285. heywood broun wrote: belle	poitrine is the most original thinker since caligula and even	fdr had to concede that if the rest of this nation showed	the foresight and patriotism of miss poitrine america would rapidly	resemble ancient babylon and nineveh.	3.6929305520202305
19286. not only were	the court costs prohibitive but i was subjected to crippling fines	in addition to usurious interest on the unpaid debts which the governmen	claimed that metronome and i owed- a severe financial blow.	5.153475979635086
19287. nor as manny said had the notoriety done my career any good.	4.509457790181907
19288. my enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges	as reactionary robber baroness and even traitor!	traitor indeed! i point now with pride to the fact that long ere	the committee on un-american activities the minute women the	economic council and other such notable watchdog organizations	were so much as heard of i was hollywood's leading bulwark against	communism fighting single-handedly creeping socialism against	such insuperable odds as the fascio-communist troops of the nra	pwa wpa ccc and an army of more than twenty-two	million mercenaries whom fdr employed secretly through	the transparent ruse of regular relief checks.	4.297450296681333
19289. needless	to say my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period.	4.317068102383446
19290. could	it do otherwise?	9.52328749892442
19291.  even though i have always had a genius for	throwing myself into every role and playing it for all it's	worth no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune	her reputation her livelihood her home and her nation itself are	all imperilled.	3.606610803422351
19292. such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to	oscar winning performances.	6.987955315139565
19293. i tried my hardest with little help	may i say from my husband and leading man but somehow the outside	pressures were too severe.	3.832214775431057
19294. having	achieved stardom a fortune and a world-renowned	wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote letch	proceeded to neglect them all.	4.67288338831304
19295. never a quick study he now	made no attempt to learn his lines and many a mile of film was	wasted many a scene- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow	thespians- was taken thirty forty fifty times because miss poitrine's	co-star and helpmate had never learned his part.	3.401327781296044
19296. each	time letch went up in his lines i was the one to	be patient helpful and apologetic while he indulged in outbursts	of temperament profanity and abuse blaming others going into sulks	and on more occasions than i care to count storming off the set	for the rest of the day.	4.4662038923798795
19297. as for his finances i was never privileged	to know exactly how much money letch had salted away.	4.163820561711629
19298. it was i who paid for our little home the food the liquor the servants-	even letch's bills at his tailor and the los angeles athletic	club.	5.058768952050513
19299. never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third	anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw.	3.9487418128311806
19300. as for his private monies they were rapidly dissipated in drinking	gaming and carousing.	6.335257132809955
19301. more than once i was confronted by professional	gamblers bookies loan sharks gangsters thugs	and finger men- people of a class i did not even know existed-	to repay my husband's staggering losses or else h i	shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with	such a sinister milieu.	3.475961793786763
19302. and at three different times during our	turbulent marriage strange girls with the commonest of accents telephoned	to announce to me that letch had sired their unborn children!	having the deepest of maternal instincts my heart fairly bled when	i thought of the darling pink and white bundles from heaven i	would have proudly given my husband.	4.4873466812409415
19303. ah you're too old was	invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever i suggested starting	a family.	3.8101576301595865
19304. letch had made it abundantly clear that he did	not care for the company of my own precious daughter.	5.768858910934141
19305. i now felt it wiser	to keep baby-dear in school and- during the summers- at a camp	run by the society of friends all year around.	3.7179667581192444
19306. her presence only	made letch more distant and irritable and in the hurry of buying chateau	belletch i had neglected to consider a room for baby-dear	so there was no place to put her anyhow.	5.308889896678659
19307. in his infinite wisdom wants us to have these inexplicable little	yet i adored this man letch feeley why i cannot say.	3.937074020344834
19308. with	faint	heart and a brave smile i endured his long absences from chateau	belletch his coldness his indifference his slights and his abuse.	4.807873378411027
19309. the times i can recall when i was publicly humiliated by him- lovely	dinner parties in our trianon suite where the collation was postponed	and postponed and postponed only to be served dry and overcooked	at a table where the host's chair was vacant; a splash party	at the new pool which i had built in the hope of keeping letch	away from public beaches when letch and a certain aquacutie stayed	underwater together for the better part of an hour; a lovely epiphany	party at errol flynn's on which sacred occasion letch stole	away with an unknown starlet leaving me high and dry to	get home as best i could.	3.0100378944727937
19310. these are but a sampling of the insults i	endured.	7.490777134143732
19311. as mrs letch feeley was it any wonder that i once	the social arbiter of filmdom was excluded from the smart entertainments	given by the astaires the coopers the gables the colmans	the rathbones the taylors the thalbergs and such devout closely	knit families as the barrymores and the crosbys?	3.1887815150952856
19312.  as letch's	antisocial conduct increased our invitations decreased and my heart	was in my mouth whenever i played hostess at a fashionable screenland	gathering.	5.076276106263437
19313. between 1935 and 1939 letch and i made ten	films together each less successful both artistically and commercially	than the one before it.	3.6008827970981727
19314. our last joint venture sainted lady	a deeply religious film based on the life of mother cabrini and	timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification	of america's first saint in november 1938 was a fiasco from start	to finish.	4.893292794189046
19315. as i was playing mother cabrini the picture was actually	all mine with nearly every scene built around me.	4.095118039087028
19316. but in	order to keep letch in the public eye and out of trouble i wrote	in a part especially for him- that of a dashing ruffian who sees	the light and is saved by the inspiring example of mother cabrini.	5.162215416313147
19317. and did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf?	4.76706915458646
19318.  did he trouble to	memorize the very small part which i had tailor-made to his specifications	a role eventually cut down to three short speeches?	5.197824939296954
19319.  did	he show the rest of the cast- numbering four thousand- the consideration	of arriving at the studio punctually- or even at all?	3.976357546727063
19320.  he	did not! the shooting went on for eight months! most	of our working days were spent on the telephone calling bookies	illegal gambling dens a certain residential club for young actresses	more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the	athletic club.	4.330527225760062
19321. whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was hung	over uncooperative rude and insulting.	4.044145488863964
19322. he made many tasteless	irreverent and unfunny remarks not only about me in the title	role but about religion in general.	5.261742226814325
19323. by the time the film was released	we were three million dollars over-spent war was imminent and the	public apparently had forgotten all about mother cabrini.	4.179265614125849
19324. thanks to	letch feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me the notices	were few and unfavorable.	5.406976804408443
19325. only george santayana seemed to understand	and appreciate the film when he wrote: miss poitrine has perpetrated	the most eloquent argument for the protestant faith yet unleashed	by hollywood.	3.555016418248523
19326. but it was small consolation.	12.184362384369043
19327. in a rare	fit of anger and spite i farmed out my own husband to a small	and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment.	3.8565294725623187
19328. the film was called the	diet of worms which i felt was just what letch deserved.	5.194730585945839
19329. it	turned out to be a life of martin luther of all things! it was	a disaster! in clothes letch simply did not project.	4.058620797377823
19330. he was laughed	off the screen.	9.357464703205716
19331. at the same time however i availed myself of the	services of that great english actor and master of make-up sir gauntley	pratt to do a quickie called the mystery of the mad	marquess in which i played a young american girl who inherits	a haunted castle on the english moors which is filled with secret passages	and sliding panels and unbeknownst to anyone is still occupied	by an eccentric maniac.	3.271202921772899
19332. it was a potboiler made on a shoestring	and not the sort of film i like as all i had to do was look	blank and scream a great deal.	5.605462186440298
19333. my heart was not in it but oddly	enough it remains the most financially successful picture of my career.	4.14982711169668
19334. letch had	returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than	before.	5.739974350684024
19335. i really loved that boy and in a feverish attempt to preserve	our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful wonderful person	letch had once been i took my troubles to momma hoping that her earthy	advice would help me.	3.6811014828810142
19336. if i could only think of something	at the studio near me to absorb his boundless energy i said.	5.901825020274188
19337. what is letch interested in?	7.52656089789606
19338.    bookies booze and	babes momma said bluntly.	7.163184125958424
19339. her reply stung me but this	was too important to let my hurt make any difference.	4.0961539092293835
19340. i can't turn	the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon i said.	5.796167530887522
19341. up to date however his garden was still more or less of a mess	he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond	in the neighborhood he hadn't found it.	4.082615928110227
19342. it wasn't his fault	that these things were so.	7.3180070949138205
19343. the difficulty was that each day seemed	to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately.	3.4758268441966145
19344. as a result life had become a kind of continuous make-ready.	8.859734285615898
19345. once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention	he could undertake the things which really counted.	3.9656398951906273
19346. then at last	his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to	read or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon	accompanied by his dogs.	4.940961648370697
19347. his dogs?	8.855326618663947
19348.  he had almost forgotten	them although they had played such an important part in his early	dreams.	5.842066784987914
19349. then they had always been romping around him on these walks	yelping with delight dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting	expeditions returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws.	3.5682567285446654
19350. dogs did something to one's ego.	7.163184125958424
19351. they were constantly assuring	you that you were one of the world's great guys.	5.265477182251099
19352. regardless of how	much of a slob you knew yourself to be you could be certain they would	never find out- and even if they did it would make no difference.	4.983175282912693
19353. now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs	in the picture.	5.421095204958976
19354. what in the world were you going to do with a lot	of dogs when you left for town on monday afternoons?	7.002545986338769
19355.  you certainly	couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm	them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused	that they would have nervous breakdowns.	4.051965176424723
19356. why in the world couldn't	he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to?	7.059089722582875
19357.    it	worried him this inability to get the simplest things done in the course	of a day.	4.525252231390075
19358. he would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about	it.	8.933130937411093
19359. how in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business	raise a family be on half a dozen boards work actively on committees	and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents	of a bulging brief case?	3.953550471454525
19360.    was it possible that as people grow	older the nature of time changed?	7.386486979850935
19361.  could it be that it speeded up for	the aged in some mysterious way as if a bored universe were skipping	through the end of the chapter just to get it over with?	4.097232108213443
19362.  or was	the answer less metaphysical?	9.205825560719608
19363.  did older people work more slowly?	5.91046315256481
19364. 	did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter shave clean	out a barn read a newspaper than a man of thirty?	5.5545584421777825
19365.  did men become	perfectionists as they grew older polishing polishing reluctant to	let go?	4.39702359129509
19366.    it might be that certain people were born with a compulsion	to complicate their lives while others could live blissfully	motionless almost indefinitely like lizards in the sun too indolent	to blink their eyes.	5.052802196217618
19367. perhaps it was his misfortune or good fortune	whichever way one looked at it to belong to the former group and he	was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded	none which was positively antagonistic to it.	3.7349931253023034
19368. and then	again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the	things he had planned to do after retirement: reading roaming gardening	lying on his back and watching the clouds go by was because	he didn't want to do them.	4.661993841897695
19369. there was no compulsion behind them.	7.230047477646065
19370. they	could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn.	5.583228874976599
19371. during	all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done.	4.4768543827211795
19372. this	habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do	anything for which no one was waiting.	5.453185432978683
19373. he looked at the luminous	dial of his wrist watch.	4.855935222748902
19374. it was five minutes after four.	8.302831016987879
19375. on some	distant farm a rooster crowed and far down the valley an associate answered.	4.303410032949336
19376. he turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head	against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn.	5.387256990561285
19377. at least	he could buy the equipment for his workshop.	5.127047393550521
19378. thus committed action	might follow.	10.264380458204188
19379. he went down to mills and bradley's hardware store	and bought a full set of carpenter's tools including a rotary	power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that mr mills	said were essential for babbiting and doweling whatever they	were.	3.329972867721586
19380. he also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools	and lumber for his workbench sandpaper and glue and assorted nails	levels and t squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he	had	no idea how to use or what they were for.	4.659073333262133
19381. that'll get you started.	6.162967476035402
19382. best not to get everything	at once.	7.9024231719118845
19383. add things as you find you need 'em.	5.215777318153505
19384. he didn't	even ask the cost of this collection.	8.014801820766854
19385. after all if you were going	to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that	was that.	4.716467272963871
19386. when he returned home the station wagon loaded with tools	jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village using	the recently purchased second car.	5.443265144298645
19387. it gave him a chance	to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage	of acid comments.	4.380017589453223
19388. he had made such a fuss about buying that second car	that he knew he was vulnerable.	6.604038471283612
19389. he piled everything neatly in	a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall.	3.9724815546372674
19390. that was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand	tools.	6.190935009948948
19391. in front of it would be his workbench.	8.116364665613416
19392. the old nightmare	which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him	once more only this time he couldn't pacify it with a sleeping pill	and	send it away.	4.898580504504411
19393. how in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall?	5.421412540296247
19394. 	how did one attach anything to a stone wall for that matter?	5.583228874976599
19395. 	after the pegboard there would be the paneling.	6.295568869908938
19396. he sat down on an	old box and focused on the problem.	5.9811526916971545
19397. perhaps one bored holes in the stone	with some kind of an electric gadget.	5.526729374102026
19398. but then when you stuck things	into the holes why didn't they come right out again?	5.806956555142623
19399.  it all	seemed rather hopeless.	7.513928624873349
19400. he turned his attention to the workbench.	8.671826949701414
19401. perhaps that was the first thing to do.	8.471344744557598
19402. a workbench had a heavy	top and sturdy legs but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top	so that the whole thing didn't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately	collapse when you leaned on it?	4.470028413343607
19403.    mr mills had done	some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of	boards and two-by-fours which properly handled would he had assured	him turn into a workbench.	3.3650249355897213
19404. they lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly	pile.	6.704377758683111
19405. mr crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot.	4.843835645977508
19406. how could	anyone know what to do with an assortment like that?	8.094408366850113
19407.  perhaps he	had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench-	someone who knew what he was about.	3.764459934389342
19408. then at least he would	have a place to hang his tools and something to work on.	5.75316208093719
19409. after that	everything should be simpler.	6.657351986402161
19410. he went upstairs to phone crumb.	8.579675670947294
19411. to his amazement he reached him.	6.106158513432547
19412. mr crumb was laid up with a	bad cold.	6.9822815050660525
19413. he didn't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone	wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable	equally lightly.	3.781791149549521
19414. the only trouble was that he himself was tied	up on the school job.	6.968471283233598
19415. that was why he hadn't been able to finish	the porch.	6.137067905850377
19416. no he didn't know of any handyman-carpenter.	8.020475615514286
19417. there	wasn't any such thing any more.	5.463712793030508
19418. carpenters all wanted steady work and	at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could	hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school	job.	4.745338440698437
19419. there was a fellow named blatz over smithtown way.	6.003946298097668
19420. nobody	liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going	to be taken drunk.	5.804062593692052
19421. mr crumb would probably see him at lodge meeting	the next night.	4.477525291817183
19422. if he was sober which was doubtful he'd have	him get in touch with mr crombie.	6.704679983062033
19423. mr blatz had been	at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to	be the greatest boon that had come into mr crombie's life since	he moved to highfield in spite of the fact that he didn't work very	fast or very long at a time and he didn't like to work at all unless	mr crombie hung around and talked to him.	3.5542428830694135
19424. he said he was the lonely	type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of	the cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you.	6.113621181170292
19425. so mr crombie	sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep mr blatz's	mind from funny things.	4.518378008583722
19426. at the same time he watched carefully to see	how one attached pegboards to stone walls but mr blatz was usually	standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he	didn't like to disclose his ignorance.	4.832922422023984
19427. while mr blatz	was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench mr crombie	told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar.	3.8800047234625112
19428. mr blatz agreed that this would be pretty.	8.194635131872912
19429. without further discussion	he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over	the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling which he	then stained and waxed according to his taste.	3.5181920698322675
19430. now he said	we got to put in some outlets for them power tools; then a couple	of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an' i guess we're about	through down here.	4.930453332508451
19431. it all did look very efficient and	shipshape.	6.16664599352105
19432. there was no question of that.	10.317086142307947
19433. by the way said mr	blatz packing his tools into a battered carrier them power tools	needs extra voltage.	4.452840061525981
19434. i guess you know about that.	7.95751090267089
19435. before you use	'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need	a new fuse box for the extra circuits.	3.7776001314856975
19436. that ain't too bad 'ceptin'	the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do	nothin'.	5.561639760162263
19437. instead of being depressed by this news mr	crombie was actually relieved.	4.825967893226949
19438. at least the moment was postponed when	he had to face the mystery of the power tools.	7.0470641472534465
19439. he followed mr	blatz up the cellar stairs.	5.13143041193367
19440. as usual mrs crombie was standing	in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils.	6.675414672946833
19441. mr blatz sat down	in the only unoccupied kitchen chair.	4.843835645977508
19442. well he said got	your man fixed up nice down there.	6.7438786899740695
19443. he oughta be able to build a	new house with all them contraptions.	4.914792116918769
19444. mr crombie watched his	wife with an anxious expression.	6.9822815050660525
19445. i was just sayin' to him that i'm	all ready now for anything else you want done.	4.187151011771805
19446. mr crombie	couldn't remember his saying any such thing.	6.9822815050660525
19447. oh that's	wonderful cried mrs crombie.	6.476461842370151
19448. i have a thousand things	for you to do.	8.666998817924643
19449. doors that won't open and doors that won't close	and shelves and broken h   but those are the things i built	the workshop for protested mr crombie.	3.4866387585553738
19450. those are	the things i can do now that i'm set up.	6.966621710592532
19451. i've	been waiting to get these things done for months she said.	4.182602481535312
19452. we	won't live long enough if i wait for you besides which you don't	need to worry- there'll be plenty more.	4.920292053327142
19453. but the discussion was	academic.	7.584993732832297
19454. mr blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf	above the kitchen sink.	5.951513488596949
19455. nothing in english has been ridiculed as much as the	ambiguous use of words unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences.	4.164531478112967
19456. ben franklin said clearly spoken mr fogg.	6.743273855772659
19457. you explain english	by greek.	8.09303208031044
19458. richard brinsley sheridan said i think the	interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two.	5.457891540300433
19459. and a witty	american journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more	true today many a writer seems to think he is never profound except	when he can't understand his own meaning.	3.5383666602634656
19460. there are many	types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians	under such names as amphibology parisology and other ologies.	6.064021275852776
19461. in common parlance they would be described as misses- misinterpreters	misunderstanders misdirectors and kindred misdeeds.	4.394330409807556
19462. one species	of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition.	6.826559902944836
19463. did	you or did you not say what i said you said because jane said you	never said what i said?	3.5853166747464886
19464.    another woman addressing christmas	cards said to her husband: we sent them one last year but	they didn't send us one so they probably won't send us one this	year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't	last year don't you think or shall we?	4.311544546862474
19465.    such ambiguous	exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded and	they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours.	3.968455481909592
19466. ambiguity	of a non-repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself	in.	5.739974350684024
19467. i'm terribly upset she told a girl-friend.	4.913686410369733
19468. i wrote	bill in my last letter to forget that i had told him that i didn't	mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind- and he	seems to have misunderstood me.	4.8613939047356265
19469. evidently bill was another of those	men who simply don't understand women.	4.182602481535312
19470. another case involves	a newspaper reporter who tripped up a politician.	6.381474036350288
19471. mr jones	you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted	the contradiction of your original statement.	3.780902381214545
19472. now would you care	to have us say that you were misquoted in regard to it?	6.165496877277071
19473.    questions	like this framed in verbal fog are perhaps the only kind that	have ever stumped an experienced politician.	3.7274763743287855
19474. they recall byron's	classic comment: i wish he would explain his explanation.	6.0639976778550295
19475. similarly when a reporter once questioned lincoln in cryptic fashion	lincoln refused to make any further statement.	4.177871427660331
19476. i fear explanations	explanatory of things explained he said leaving the biter bit-	and bitter.	5.794496086763905
19477. the obscurity of politicians may not always be	as innocent as it looks.	3.7464843722238697
19478. senator said an interviewer your	constituents can't understand from your speech last night just how	you stand on the question.	5.275662091823544
19479. it	took me five hours to write it that way.	4.477601198394805
19480. the misplaced	modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity	than in the breach.	4.827508206929211
19481. this creates an amusing effect because its	position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word.	4.06469655876809
19482. a verse	familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain: i saw a man once	beat	his wife when on a drunken spree.	5.0952896221356765
19483. now can you tell me who was	drunk- the man his wife or me?	4.31964558168508
19484.    the wooden-leg	gag of vaudeville another standby of this sort had endless variations.	5.447120157347805
19485. there's a man outside with a wooden leg named smith.	4.498994186165571
19486. what's the name of his other leg?	8.158364295244246
19487.    another	stock vaudeville gag ran: mother is home sick in bed with the	doctor.	4.1182606204741266
19488. when radio came in it continued the misplaced modifier	in its routines as a standard device.	5.7684707346450566
19489. do you see that	pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on?	5.090044830862406
19490.  i see	the girl but i don't see the car with slacks on.	5.9625205134376795
19491. in	recent years gagwriters have discovered this brand of blunder and thus	the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the gagline.	3.5515107528251715
19492. in one cartoon a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the	family addressing the doorman: excuse me but when we came out	we found that we had left my daughter's handbag and my wife's behind.	4.927575612278133
19493. journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips.	4.317068102383446
19494. not long ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest	that snapshots must be of a person not larger than f inches.	5.48950332628826
19495. classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions.	4.6724501027054846
19496. readers of the reader's digest are familiar with such	items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips like the ad in	a california paper that advertised house for rent.	4.507841974446781
19497. view takes in	five counties two bedrooms.	5.219666477665999
19498. since brevity is the soul of	ambiguity as well as wit newspaper headlines continually provide	us with amusing samples.	6.34018949459368
19499. many shapes	in bathtubs.	8.721858418760375
19500. son and daughter of local couple married.	6.743273855772659
19501. apart from misplaced modifiers and headlinese journalism contributes	a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising	matter.	4.2569869187675735
19502. a weekly newspaper reported a local romance:	h and the couple were married last saturday thus ending a friendship	which began in their schooldays.	4.792851478927999
19503. an item in the letters	column of a newspaper renewed a subscription adding: i personally	enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband.	4.07568504684475
19504. then there	was the caterer's ad which read: are you getting married	or having an affair?	5.737896102862641
19505.  we have complete facilities to accommodate	200 people.	5.993134026498008
19506. the newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the	anatomical.	5.46782652830974
19507. this slip is so-called because its semi-ambiguous	english always seems to refer to a person's anatomy but never quite	means what it seems to say.	3.962845140784382
19508. samples: he walked in upon her invitation.	6.743273855772659
19509. she kissed him passionately upon his reappearance.	5.4558319364004175
19510. not without good reason has the anatomical been called	jocular journalese.	6.731522783995304
19511. in news items a man is less often shot in the body	or head than in the suburbs.	4.861820731399655
19512. while henry morgan was escorting	miss vera green from the church social last saturday night a savage	dog attacked them and bit mr morgan on the public square.	4.985380791494295
19513. such items recall the california journalist who reported an	accident involving a movie star: the area in which miss n- was	injured is spectacularly scenic.	3.989882901330854
19514. the double meaning in the	anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device as in the gags of	weber and fields.	5.419366202728142
19515. when a witness at court was asked if he had been	kicked in the ensuing rumpus he replied no it was in the stomach.	4.573553469262806
19516. strangely enough this always brought the house down.	6.412214371980113
19517. apart	from journalese and vaudeville gags the anatomical is also found	in jocular literature.	4.0683852436856025
19518. a conscientious girl became the secretary of	a doctor.	6.338814096168618

19688. it isn't what the ideologist believes in	but what he hates that puts the world in jeopardy.	6.006193487219646
19689. this is the force	in our time and in every other time that urges the paranoiac and the	manic-depressive to become head of a state.	3.9283244368883787
19690. complete power not only	corrupts but it also attracts the mad.	6.435269705862182
19691. there is a bitter satire for	a future writer in that.	5.338487867938731
19692. great satire has always been clearly	written and readily understandable i said.	6.182071291958947
19693. but we now	find writers obsessed by the nooks and crannies of their ivory towers	and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity and complexity of poetry	and non-poetry.	3.750258159371617
19694. i wrote a few years ago that one of the cardinal rules	of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of	what the story is about.	6.808161908067884
19695. one day the children had wanted to get up onto general burnside's	horse.	5.2474676745494335
19696. they wanted to see what his back felt like- the general's.	7.4569252112656335
19697. he looked so comfortable being straight.	5.47465632959774
19698. they wanted to touch	the mystery.	9.899613284749938
19699. arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came	by.	4.499885526347055
19700. arlene had a hard voice too this	time.	7.443341453162344
19701. the policeman's eyes rather popped for a second; but then	arlene got another tone in a hurry and she said if it wasn't	for these dear children-.	3.205117876420742
19702. the policeman got a confused	funny look on his face and he had answered kind of politely now	look here lady: i know you got to entertain these kids and all.	4.501492715895279
19703. but this is a public park and it's a city ordinance that the statues	cannot be crawled on.	4.869952395581548
19704. arlene was so ashamed that she hung	her head when she said yes sir.	5.648250865720561
19705. the policeman walked	on but he looked back once.	4.1174608023645085
19706. that had happened on the day when	two	other unusual things had occurred.	6.889031291100974
19707. arlene had taught them a new way	to have fun in their little private area; and they had told their	mother about the tumbles.	3.4763849844917574
19708. in matters of exact information that kept	her one step behind developments; and so they were consistently true	to their principles.	5.280798270803465
19709. never mind arlene had said after	the policeman had left having pursued the usual unco-operative course	of grownups.	3.9781841915646017
19710. i know something that is much more fun	that we can do on our little lawn.	6.702174164808953
19711. what is it?	10.103359645989507
19712.  asked	the children whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably	normal and predictable.	5.583228874976599
19713. maybe that was why they were cordial and	loyal towards the unpredictability of arlene.	4.374950379108932
19714. just you wait	advised arlene echoing the dialogue in a recent british movie.	6.666060039128351
19715. and when they had got to their little lawn they had had a most	twirlingly magnificent time.	5.029815086987443
19716. first arlene had put them through	some rapid somersaults.	7.445758940166245
19717. they had protested that that wasn't any	surprise.	6.080528909006764
19718. just you wait said arlene again as though	she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy	little sturdy statement.	5.334957820346742
19719. is it	anything like cooked-over oatmeal?	7.025861531969416
19720.  asked one of the children.	12.407618754725245
19721. not the least bit arlene snapped.	6.212157647672607
19722. one of the many things	that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously	particularly your very very serious questions.	5.377789705972658
19723. those were	especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest.	4.856453263942021
19724. she would	sometimes even get a little hard on you she took you so seriously.	5.84448600442557
19725. but not hard for very long.	6.307272485183866
19726. just long enough to make you feel important.	7.872190454480204
19727. now said arlene eventually making them both	sit in formation on a big root of a live oak the sort of root that divided	itself and made their bottoms sag down and feel comfortable.	3.467732619727592
19728. now	we're going to be like what general burnside and his horse make	us think of.	6.174237983488406
19729. the children looked at each other and	sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever.	4.12794548618983
19730. their curiosity	went happily out of bounds.	7.975160304402469
19731. then arlene threw herself	backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful.	4.840149419692605
19732. she held herself	that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked.	5.737721461204343
19733. imagine being able to laugh and wink when you're like the top part	of that picture frame at home one of them said.	3.999241081330808
19734. they both laughed	and winked back.	8.753554831120512
19735. i'm general burnside's horse upside	down arlene said sort of gaspingly for her: even she had	to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position.	3.653722747760543
19736. she made general	burnside's horse's belly do so funny when it was upside down.	6.4792584814431
19737. then she was back on her feet winking and smiling that enormous	smile	.	4.600586865673385
19738. and she would wink and throw	kisses.	8.585366223886316
19739. they both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time	but it made their lips and eyelids tremble.	4.196087989440181
19740. but they kept on	clapping for a long long time.	8.712947768173542
19741. this time arlene said	and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking	you're going to tell me what i am and what i'm doing.	3.910393268521372
19742. it	all has something to do with general burnside and his horse.	6.825098342653064
19743. this time it was so grand; they could tell exactly what it was.	4.629501241616555
19744. it was general burnside's horse running in a circle.	6.883858155724413
19745. his legs	shook and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to	his shoulders.	3.8815959958195028
19746. that's the general's horse one of them cried	out.	7.820198492006049
19747. the other remarked in a happy laughter that's	a funny old horse.	4.309703713040091
19748. the first one said he sure does shake.	6.941533372434465
19749. then there was the general kissing his	wife.	7.698481703332395
19750. they had to be told that one.	11.34196466328518
19751. but it was even funnier after	they had been told.	6.313023809201221
19752. their father when he came back from those many	business trips just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips	and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in	the electric icebox.	4.801096048235532
19753. he was the funniest	man.	9.657405264404062
19754. he never could keep still even when he didn't move his feet.	6.124927306675646
19755. then they had to get up and be general burnside.	5.626759743676944
19756. all they could think of was to run around in circles kicking	their legs out.	5.759279196240886
19757. then they said general	burnside was going to jump over his horse's head; and they did some	somersaults.	4.627634396214611
19758. but that wasn't very funny either.	9.054920125506417
19759. you	ought to shake arlene advised them.	5.219666477665999
19760. and arlene showed them how	to begin.	7.771377502193086
19761. she also taught them to sing i wish i could shimmy like	my sister kate.	4.348807100710214
19762. they were clumsy but they	were beginning to catch on.	7.111671096338351
19763. they also caught on a little bit on how to	smile a lot without your lips trembling.	4.265515606615835
19764. imagine you won't get	your allowance if you're caught not smiling- or smiling with your	lips trembling too much arlene suggested.	5.0741823155193835
19765. that helped a	great deal.	7.512203395885849
19766. they were a little late in getting home.	8.163606444320354
19767. i'm	sorry mrs minks arlene said in a tone so low you could	hardly hear it.	4.204187973707147
19768. my mother constituted herself the voice	of all of us.	7.021481634550851
19769. it's perfectly understandable arlene my mother	said in a friendly way.	4.35402741911671
19770. i suppose you all were playing and forgot?	7.464914450239265
19771. 	yes ma'am the children chorused heartily.	5.219666477665999
19772. the children rushed off to	get rid of their sweaters; and arlene began tapping the kitchen door	open.	5.119697286779942
19773. arlene's a good girl my uncle remarked to us; but	he said it too soon for it came out just before the tap to which the	door responded.	3.47974211439139
19774. that tap had a slight bangish quality.	7.787532299577984
19775. she	really is a dear little thing my mother agreed.	4.477601198394805
19776. her upper lip	lifted	slightly.	11.59059993044793
19777. she was biting into a small red radish; and that action	always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing.	3.7269325483570404
19778. also	she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled up in	a neat mean little heap at the white center of the radish.	5.27266191797637
19779. she would	try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth	to the place where she was biting.	3.729453665237855
19780. it never worked naturally; but	it made her look unusual.	7.17804188424433
19781. also when she had bitten off half of the small	radish she found the suspense unbearable; and she would snatch	the finger-held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it.	3.873229213639962
19782. one could hear a very faint ladylike sigh of relief.	6.944223398326892
19783. actually it	was inaudible to anyone not expecting it.	5.335800969885122
19784. but the warm joy of her brown	eyes was open to the general public.	6.880782540414685
19785. later on the children	told her further about somersaulting.	5.591546253494821
19786. it must be awfully good	for them.	10.329179711679846
19787. and awfully kind of arlene she told us later.	4.767272111599635
19788. but	do you know something curious?	7.712079578137997
19789.  she added.	9.848420478905924
19790. i reached into	that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress.	5.98164549143778
19791. i have no notion	why i reached.	7.281446115541082
19792. and i found a radish.	10.337743343408698
19793. was it an omen?	7.951347030245299
19794.  i thought	for a second.	9.645886477709713
19795. but i would not pamper myself in that silly way.	5.771099423914711
19796. i opened the window and threw the radish out.	6.662548872677544
19797. then my mother	blushed at this small lie; for she knew and we knew that it was	cowardice that had made one more radish that night just too impossible	a strain.	3.4872105639383975
19798. arlene became indispensable; nobody could have	told why.	6.782953866207488
19799. it was in the air.	9.032781166838381
19800. a friend of my father's	came to dinner.	6.658073663699706
19801. he was passing through town and phoned to say	hello.	5.119057942974641
19802. as a result he was persuaded out to dinner.	8.288334495875821
19803. as a matter of	fact this happened every four or five months.	5.884279580564213
19804. sometimes he coincided	with my father's being at home.	7.266029997953518
19805. sometimes as at this juncture he	did not.	5.6763254963364425
19806. but he was always persuaded out.	10.195770959724745
19807. he liked children	in a loathsome kind of way; the two youngest in our family always had	to be	brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment.	3.526531526037759
19808. when he	had left i could never remember whether he had poked them in their	middles laughingly with a thick index finger or whether he was merely	so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action	not bothering to look.	4.607329420916528
19809. the children loathed him too.	5.574739962696032
19810. this evening	they were pushed in from the breakfast room with odds and ends	of dessert distributed over them.	5.505620793901751
19811. there had been some coconut in it	for i remember my mother's taking a quick glance at a stringy bit	of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her radish	with a shiver.	4.061251423767185
19812. they were pushed gently into the room by arlene-	whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back	around to the kitchen side of the door.	5.495556006256172
19813. we had just sat down.	7.379510186999975
19814. tell mr gorboduc what you're doing these days my mother	advised the children ceremonially.	5.503967753802367
19815. there was an air of revolt	about the children- even irreverence for their own principles.	4.831336403684002
19816. this	could be told chiefly from a sort of head-tossing and prancing a	horselike balkiness of demeanor.	5.81830416403198
19817. possibly the coconut-containing dessert	had brought up bitter problems of administration.	4.361713646322975
19818. but at the beginning	this stayed just in the air.	7.839531678258131
19819. we go to the park with	this nice lady one of them said.	5.620457519837331
19820. this happy bulletin convulsed mr gorboduc.	7.416165143643923
19821. you do?	11.68952670743481
19822. 	he asked between wheezes of laughter.	7.163184125958424
19823. he was forced to wipe his eyes.	6.351924390868505
19824. you don't step on the flowers do you?	7.689338099949349
19825.  eh?	10.144513917544229
19826.    one	of the children maneuvered out of range of the poking index finger.	6.3782413573988
19827. mr gorboduc	took a swig of his sherry.	5.392118441522236
19828. he was so long thinking that my mother had	time to inspect her sherry for dregs.	6.0377111114173205
19829. usually this was done when	attention was diverted by someone else's long boring story.	4.374935163523301
19830. but this	time she was nervous: she was open.	6.9332890522555335
19831. mr gorboduc was finally	in command of his mind again.	4.843835645977508
19832. tell me- what do you do at	the park?	7.341121298853138
19833.  he asked.	8.80323508231408
19834. this was delivered in a forthright way without	coyness and over-pretended interest- an admirable way with children.	5.693208526140209
19835. only unfortunately he could not remove from his voice a nagging	insinuation of the direct command.	4.532744909271837
19836. this nettled the children into the	revelation of exact truth a sacrifice of their secret superiority	over grown people but a victory in the wide fields of perpetration and	illegitimate accomplishment.	4.757681688662125
19837. we bump one said; and	the other went on to development of the idea.	5.23944094270232
19838. we grind too he	said.	9.868481567542823
19839. my mother was beside herself with curiosity.	5.967798962588571
19840. say that	again she pleaded.	8.659163983944062
19841. she laughed a little and tossed the dregs rakishly	around in her glass.	4.425139319667652
19842. you what?	16.042065620274318
19843.  she could see that mr	gorboduc was intrigued; the hostess in her took over.	4.666188825835347
19844. you what?	16.042065620274318
19845.    my uncle looked at mr	gorboduc.	6.491748007815632
19846. he read henry james and used to pretend profundity	through eye-beamings at people.	5.752586250134144
19847. he	would not look up.	6.250893917589588
19848. he was very funny about the whole thing.	7.610687131002604
19849. a delightful	vignette set in the unforgettable epoch of pre-punic war rome.	4.144256012964684
19850. marcellus the hero is beset from all sides by the problems of	approaching manhood.	5.448482501884564
19851. the story opens on the eve of his fifty-third birthday	as he prepares for the two weeks of festivities that are to follow.	3.922521100839497
19852. suddenly a messenger arrives and just before collapsing dead	at his feet informs him that the saracens have invaded silesia the	home province of his affianced.	5.099318095864945
19853. he at once cancels the celebrations	and buckling on his scimitar stumbles blindly from the house where	he is hit and killed by a passing oxcart.	3.68066510195704
19854. the albany civic	opera's presentation of spumoni's immortal il sevigli	del spegititgninino with guest contralto hattie sforzt.	4.827508206929211
19855. an	unusual if not extraordinary rendering of the classic myth that involves	the rescue of prometheus from the rock by the us cavalry	was given last week in the warehouse of the albany leather conduit	company amid cheers of hubba hubba and yalagaloo pip pip!	after a busy overture the curtain rises on a farm	scene- the ranavan valley in northern maine.	3.1942179699665503
19856. a dead armadillo	the sole occupant of the stage symbolizes the crisis and destruction	of the old order.	5.37932825090455
19857. old order acted and atonally sung by grunnfeu	arapacis the lovely serbantian import then entered and delivered	the well-known invocation to the god phineoppus whereupon the stage	is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of wandering gorshek priests	symbolizing love lust prudence and general motors respectively.	3.261476022444444
19858. according to the myth old order then vanishes at stage left	and reappears at extreme stage right but director shuz skillfully sidesteps	the rather gooshey problem of stage effects by simply having	miss arapacis walk across the stage.	4.729862266833237
19859. the night we saw it a rather	unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the	armadillo complaining- in ad-lib- that it smelled.	3.356801233047041
19860. we caught	the early train to new york.	7.543900632520252
19861. a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with eurasian	proto-senility cults.	4.912869622796152
19862. it's somewhat off the beaten track to	be sure but therein lies its variety and charm.	5.2288514545018705
19863. for example probably	very few people know that the word visrhanik that is bantered	about so much today stems from the verb bouanahsha: to salivate.	4.07834272818793
19864. likewise and equally fascinating is the news that such unlikely	synonyms as pratakku sweathruna and the tongue-twister	nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen	all originated in the same	village in bathar-on-walli	province and are all used to express	sentiments concerning british imperialism.	4.655966489312704
19865. the terms are fairly	safe to use on this side of the ocean but before you start spouting	them to your date it might be best to find out if he was a member of	major pockmanster's delhi regiment since resentment toward the	natives was reportedly very high in that outfit.	3.7821304548509733
19866. the	breeze and chancellor neitzbohr a movie melodrama that concerns	the attempts of a west german politician to woo a plaster cast of	the apollo belvedere.	4.714137561967006
19867. as you have doubtless guessed already the plot	is plastered with freudian jungian and meinckian theory.	4.504321551514546
19868. for	example when the film is only four minutes old neitzbohr refers to	a small victorian piano stool as wilhelmina and we are thereupon	subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool	was once used by an epileptic governess whose name of course was	doris	.	4.314494262432232
19869. for the remainder of the movie chancellor	neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano stool with a slat from a venetian	blind that used to hang in the pre-war reichstag.	3.8022982212327023
19870. in this manner	he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt pangs caused by his	personal assaults against the english at dunkirk.	5.392091183673811
19871. as we find out	at the end it is not the stool	that he is punishing but the piece of venetian blind.	4.913393780670195
19872. and when	the slat finally shatters we see him count the fragments all the	while muttering he loves me he loves me not.	4.967178624117571
19873. after a few tortuous	moments of wondering who he is the camera pans across the	room to the plaster statue and we realize that neitzbohr is trying	to redeem himself in the eyes of a mute piece of sculpture.	4.044208998844016
19874. the effect	needless to say is almost terrifying and though at times a bit obscure	the film is certainly a much-needed catharsis for the repressed	movie-goer.	4.56621318851021
19875. the music of bini salfininistas	capital lp 63711-r one of the rare recordings of this	titanic	yet unsung composer.	4.685678920471155
19876. those persons who were lucky enough to see	and hear the performance of his work at the brest-silevniov festival	in august 1916 will certainly welcome his return to public notice;	and it is not unlikely that even as the great bach lay dormant	for so many years so has the erudite ingenious salfininistas passed	through his purgatory of neglect.	4.76321101041572
19877. but now under the guidance	of the contemporary composer marc schlek jr a major revival	is under way.	4.163945293525977
19878. as he leads the neurenschatz skolkau orchestra schlek	gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the baslot and	rattzhenfuut concertos including the controversial tschilwyk cadenza	which was included at the conductor's insistence.	5.053286753495716
19879. a major portion	of the credit should also go to flautist haumd for his rendering of	the almost impossible indianapolis movement in the baslot.	3.591947018256229
19880. not	only was haumd's intonation and phrasing without flaw but he seemed	to take every tonal eccentricity in stride.	5.086691343563527
19881. for example to move	from the lowest f-major register up to a	barely audible n minor in four seconds not skipping at the same	time even one of the 407 fingerings seems a feat too absurd to consider	and it is to the flautist's credit that he remained silent	throughout the passage.	3.731068933240012
19882. we would have preferred however to have had	the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing at this and other spots	on the recording since it mars an otherwise sober if not lofty	performance.	5.2486663939546805
19883. as broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted down by trite heavy-handed	commercially successful musicals and inspirational problem dramas	the american theatre is going through an inexorable renaissance	in that nebulous area known as off-broadway.	3.398446589395808
19884. for the last two	years this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called	non-dramas which have left indelible bittersweet impressions on	the psyche of this veteran theatregoer.	5.796572186501671
19885. the latest and significantly	greatest fruit of this theatrical vine is the an adaptation of	basho's classic frog-haiku by roger entwhistle a former university	of maryland chemistry instructor.	3.326611120698147
19886. although the play does show	a certain structural amateurishness	the statement	it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound	and worthy of our attention.	5.100122667625429
19887. the action centers about a group	of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria	and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot	coffee.	3.406743357093066
19888. they are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress	the police and an intruding government tutor.	5.6328843990765405
19889. the innocence that	they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when	one of them asking for a piece of lemon-meringue pie gets a plate	of english muffins instead.	3.6190496178297002
19890. leaving the theatre after the performance	i had a flash of intuition that life after all	is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee and that this	unpretentious moving clever bitter slice of life was the greatest	thing to happen to the american theatre since brooks atkinson retired.	4.389247724039265
19891. aging but still precocious french feline enfant terrible	francoisette lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old paris	again this time with a sexy ballet scenario called the lascivious	interlude the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls	hopelessly in love with a middle-aged steam shovel.	3.4211379981463628
19892. a biting pithy	parable of the all-pervading hollowness of modern life the piece	has been set by mlle	lagoon to a sumptuous score	by existentialist hot-shot	jean-paul sartre.	4.690077521074806
19893. petite lovely yvette chadroe plays the	nymphomaniac engagingly.	4.913686410369733
19894. ever since bambi and more recently	born free there have been a lot of books about animals	but few compare with max fink's wry understated charming and immensely	readable my friend the quizzical salamander.	5.405771108062341
19895. done in	the modern style of a confession fink tells in exquisite detail	how he came to know and more important love his mother's pet salamander	alicia.	3.476381579288632
19896. it is not an entirely happy book as mrs fink	soon becomes jealous of alicia and in retaliation refuses to continue	to scrape the algae off her glass.	5.258704154130121
19897. max in a fit of despair takes	alicia and runs off for two marvelous weeks in burbank		at the end of which alicia tragically contracts parkinson's disease	and dies.	3.718089045195082
19898. this brief resume hardly does the book justice but	i heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major	problems of our time.	5.143520816397015
19899. opera in the grand tradition along	with mah-jongg seems to be staging a well-deserved comeback.	4.564216800203012
19900. in this	country the two guiding lights are without doubt felix fing and	anna pulova.	5.731306841482487
19901. fing a lean chiseled impeccable gentleman of the old	school who was once mistaken on the street for sir cedric hardwicke	is responsible for the rediscovery of verdi's earliest most raucous	opera nabisco	a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting	leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent of the mudugno	version of volare.	3.359965165334952
19902. miss pulova has a voice that maria callas	once described as like chipping teeth with a screw driver	and her round opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective of the	emotions demanded by the role of rosalie.	4.98383767874193
19903. the champs elysees	is literally littered this summer with the prostrate bodies of france's	beat-up beatnik jeunes filles.	3.470558666016351
19904. cause of all this commotion:	squat pug-nosed balding hopelessly ugly jean-pierre bravado	a bogartian figure who plays a sadistic amoral philosophic tasti-freeze	salesman in old new-waver fredrico de mille rossilini's	endlessly provocative film a sour sponge.	4.499253737968193
19905. bravado has been	alternately described as a symbol of the new grandeur of france and	myself	and a decadent disgusting slob!	but no one can deny that the screen crackles with electricity	whenever he is on it.	3.74739891554671
19906. soaring to stardom along with him margo	felicity brighetti a luscious and curvaceously beguiling italian	starlet turns in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic.	4.714137561967006
19907. the battle of the drib-drool continues but most of new york's	knowing sophisticates of abstract expressionism are stamping their	feet impatiently in expectation of v day	september first when augustus quasimodo's first one-man show opens	at the guggenheim.	3.391823194208843
19908. we have heard that after seeing mr quasimodo's	work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity	and importance of the whole abstract movement.	5.907254863944836
19909. and it is thought	by many who think about such things that quasimodo is the logical culmination	of a school that started with monet progressed through kandinsky	and the cubist picasso and blossomed just recently in pollock	and de kooning.	3.5023671182976446
19910. quasimodo defines his own art as the search	for what is not there.	5.583228874976599
19911. i paint the nothing he said	once to franz kline and myself the nothing that is behind the something	the inexpressible unpaintable 'tick' in the unconscious	the 'spirit' of the moment resting forever suspended like a huge	balloon in non-time.	3.3479808358781513
19912. it is his relentlessness and unwaivering adherence	to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him	to paint such pictures as the invasion of cuba.	5.302378989115398
19913. in this work	his use of non-color is startling and skillful.	5.004828069661893
19914. the sweep of space	the delicate counterbalance of the white masses the over-all completeness	and unity the originality and imagination all entitle it to be	called an authentic masterpiece.	4.668300184649826
19915. i asked quasimodo recently how he	accomplished this and he replied that he had painted his model a beautiful	shade of red and then had her breathe on the canvas which	was his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity.	3.5474204436909647
19916. dear sirs: let me begin by clearing up any possible misconception	in your minds wherever you are.	5.170466795053858
19917. the collective by which i	address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but	an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves.	3.293333371282077
19918. it is i	am reliably given to understand the technical argot for those who engage	in your particular branch of the boost; ie burglars who	rob while the tenants are absent in contrast to hot-slough prowlers	those who work while the occupants are home.	4.896755266957067
19919. since the latter obviously	require an audacity you do not possess you may perhaps suppose that	i am taunting you as socially inferior.	4.007182668341469
19920. far from it; i merely	draw an etymological distinction hoping that specialists and busy people	like you will welcome such precision in a layman.	5.088880028317707
19921. above all disabuse	yourselves of any thought that i propose to vent moral indignation	at your rifling my residence to whimper over the loss of a few objets	d'art or to shame you into rectitude.	3.698694149635056
19922. my object rather is to	alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest	implications for you far beyond the legal sanctions society might	inflict.	5.746513326816236
19923. you have unwittingly set in motion forces so malign so vindictive	that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about	them.	4.21883692590518
19924. quite candidly fellows i wouldn't be in your shoes for	all the rice in china.	5.6673789910129555
19925. as you've doubtless forgotten the circumstances	in the press of more recent depredations permit me to recapitulate	them briefly.	4.152060559162488
19926. sometime on saturday evening august 22nd	while my family and i were dining at the hostaria dell' orso in	rome you jimmied a window of our home in bucks county pennsylvania	and let yourselves into the premises.	4.4086953543581515
19927. hastening to the attic the	temperature of which was easily hotter than the gold coast you proceeded	to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet some khaki pants	and the like and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored	there.	3.2502595980421987
19928. what you were looking for	eludes me but to judge from	phonograph records scattered about a fumed-oak victrola you danced	two tangos and a paso doble which must have been fairly enervating	in that milieu.	4.956261411468882
19929. you then descended one story glommed a television	set from the music room- the only constructive feature of your visit	by the way- and returning to the ground floor entered the master	bedroom.	3.78197741103305
19930. from the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus	beneath you abstracted seventeen ivory metal wood and stone sculptures	of oriental and african origin two snuffboxes and a jade-handled	magnifying glass.	4.8832821851771255
19931. rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby you	unearthed an antique french chess set in ivory and sandalwood which	along with two box kodaks you added to your haul.	3.3277242066172517
19932. then having	wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on you lammed out	the front door considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover.	4.825124290679156
19933. so much for the tiresome facts as familiar to you i'm	sure as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake.	4.1199827761609455
19934. the foregoing aided by several clues i'll withhold to keep you	on your toes will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of inspector	javert but before they close in gird yourselves i repeat for a vengeance	infinitely more pitiless.	4.189770055441257
19935. fourteen of the sculptures you took	posses properties of a most curious and terrifying nature as you will	observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in	patches.	3.3456467208501737
19936. in time these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce	riddling	you with frambesia the king's evil sheep rot and clonic	spasm until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for	release.	4.646605824544013
19937. all this though is simply a prelude a curtain-raiser	for what ensues and i doubt whether any occidental could accurately	forecast it.	4.011538726161315
19938. if however it would help to intensify your anguish	i can delimit the powers of a few of the divinities you've affronted	and describe the punishment they meted out in one analogous instance.	5.2623809362490555
19939. first of all the six figures of the buddha	you heisted- four siamese heads a black obsidian statuette in the	earth-touching position and a large brass figure of the dying buddha	on a teakwood base.	3.8882584400590336
19940. now you probably share the widespread western	belief that the lord buddha is the most compassionate of the gods	much more so than jehovah and allah and the rest.	5.117597675081142
19941. 'fess up- don't	you?	6.939425769494729
19942.  well ordinarily he is except	toward impious folk who steal disturb or maltreat the	presence.	6.063358046174311
19943. very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such	jokers.	5.253286578342411
19944. eight or ten years ago a couple of french hoods stole a priceless	khmer head from the musee guimet in paris and a week later	crawled into the salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy.	5.135588415063502
19945. hell's own amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate	their	torment; they expired amid indescribable fantods imploring the blessed	one to forgive their desecration.	3.467766426174774
19946. any reputable french interne	can supply you with a dozen similar instances and i'll presently	recount a case out of my own personal experience but for the moment	let's resume our catalogue.	5.049675785729461
19947. whether the pair of sudanese	ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers	to lead as a dealer in khartoum assured me i am not competent to	say.	3.719005601445064
19948. likewise the ivory chinese female figure known as a doctor	lady; a friend of mine removing her from the	curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer but he had	previously drunk a quantity of applejack.	4.543299462384815
19949. the three indian brass deities	though- ganessa siva and krishna- are an altogether different	cup of tea.	3.8553111060060417
19950. they hail from travancore a state in the subcontinent	where kali the goddess of death is worshiped.	6.058002734486469
19951. have you ever	heard of thuggee?	7.074686404178957
19952.  nuf sed h.	9.52328749892442
19953. but it is the wooden sculpture from	bali the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and	their bodies interlaced by a fish that i particularly call to your	attention.	3.9595813795230055
19954. oddly enough this is an amulet against housebreakers presented	to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949.	5.398505420181998
19955. inscribed around	its base is a charm in balinese a dialect i take it you don't	comprehend.	3.8101576301595865
19956. neither do i but the tjokorda agoeng was good enough	to translate and i'll do as much for you.	5.611644096654948
19957. whosoever violates our	rooftree the legend states can expect maximal sorrow.	4.317068102383446
19958. the teeth	will rain from his mouth like pebbles his wife will make him cocu	with fishmongers and a trolley car will grow in his stomach.	4.426391855976781
19959. furthermore-	and this to me strikes an especially warming note- it shall	avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot.	3.467766426174774
19960. the	cycle of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours	and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation.	5.068698457689905
19961. sort of remorseless	isn't it?	6.162967476035402
19962.  still there it is.	10.98748798326302
19963. now you no doubt regard	the preceding as pap; you're tooling around full of gage in your hot	rods gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns	and generally behaving like u^bermenschen.	3.3830055212378953
19964. in that case listen	to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled with our joss.	6.164677743223478
19965. a couple	of years back i occupied a village apartment whose outer staircase	contained the type of niche called a coffin turn.	3.816475563359251
19966. in it was	a stone tibetan buddha i had picked up in bombay and occasionally	to make merit my wife and i garlanded it with flowers or laid a	few pennies in its lap.	4.618872268567979
19967. after a while we became aware that the money	was disappearing as fast as we replenished it.	4.391962499867034
19968. our suspicions eventually	centered by the process of elimination on a grocer's boy a	thoroughly bad hat who delivered cartons to the people overhead.	5.732866258982268
19969. the	more i probed into this young man's activities and character the	less savory i found him.	3.8101576301595865
19970. i learned for example that he made a practice	of yapping at dogs he encountered and in winter of sprinkling	salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet.	5.071112980575997
19971. his energy was prodigious;	sometimes he would be up before dawn clad as a garbage collector	and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us and thereafter would	hurry to the bronx zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar	butts against their paws.	3.2638418535741613
19972. evenings he was frequently to be seen at restaurants	like enrico + paglieri's or peter's backyard drunkenly	donning ladies' hats and singing o sole mio.	5.087416540796416
19973. in short	and to borrow an arboreal phrase slash timber.	4.713566240345231
19974. well the odious little	toad went along chivying animals and humans who couldn't retaliate	and in due course as was inevitable overreached himself.	5.170477185075472
19975. one morning	we discovered not only that the pennies were missing from the	idol but that a cigarette had been stubbed out in its lap.	3.666946709850918
19976. now he's	bought it said my wife contentedly.	8.033805969956559
19977. no divinity will hold	still for that.	5.9905667560537506
19978. he's really asking for it.	7.712079578137997
19979. and how right she was.	7.1236073013709165
19980. the next time we saw him he was a changed person; he had aged	thirty years and his face the color of tallow was crisscrossed with	wrinkles	as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire.	5.094978340063285
19981. some sort of	nemesis was haunting his footsteps he told us in a quavering voice-	either an ape specter or abe spector a process-server we couldn't	determine which.	3.5700414094207873
19982. his eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as dr	grimesby roylott's when he was found before his open safe wearing	the speckled band.	5.513089067925562
19983. the grocery the youth worked for soon tired	of his depressing effect on customers most of whom were sufficiently	neurotic without the threat of incubi and let him go.	3.4939439850310503
19984. the beautiful	the satisfying part of his disintegration however was the masterly	way the buddha polished him off.	5.282322141876069
19985. reduced to beggary he at last got	a job as office boy to a television producer.	3.9400065970399494
19986. his hubris deficiency	of taste and sadism carried him straightaway to the top.	5.765327675605419
19987. he evolved	programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks	and quickly superseded his boss.	3.834693659301933
19988. not long ago i rode down	with him in an elevator in radio city; he was talking to himself	thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at once clearly a man in	extremis.	4.945486222246104
19989. see that guy?	9.251525865485867
19990.  the operator asked pityingly.	6.996412649665628
19991. i	wouldn't be in his shoes for all the rice in china.	4.827596059796444
19992. there's	some kind of a nemesis haunting his footsteps.	6.712124678367471
