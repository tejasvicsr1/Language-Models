SENTENCES AND THEIR PERPLEXITY


1. thus the transformation of adam	smith's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides	closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life.	4.694668224237273
2. driven	from the marketplace by the course of history our hero disguises	himself as a private detective.	6.246798213044031
3. the birth of the myth compensates	for the death of the ideal.	5.311583065254168
4. even on the fictional level however	the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully	resolved.	6.2255442657505915
5. the individualism and public service of the private detective	both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct:	he enforces the law without being told to do so.	3.589017186915129
6. the private eye is therefore	a moral man; but his morality rests upon that of his society.	5.3535135909338125
7. the basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between	good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal.	4.253417229130161
8. unfortunately this assumption does not always hold good.	7.721980414858568
9. as	capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon	force and violence for its survival the private detective is placed	in a serious dilemma.	4.009567886504237
10. if he is good he may not be legal; if he is	legal he may not be good.	8.342686079758515
11. it is the gradual unfolding and deepening	of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution	of the mystery story.	4.324068562605547
12. with the advent of sir arthur	conan doyle's sherlock holmes the development of the modern private	detective begins.	7.381362699268692
13. sherlock holmes is not merely an individualist;	he is very close to being a mental case.	5.238478952681291
14. a brief list of the great	detective's little idiosyncrasies would provide dr freud with	ample food for thought.	6.006548844771116
15. holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and	other refreshing stimulants; he is prone to semi-catatonic trances	induced by the playing of the vioiln; he is a recluse an incredible	egotist a confirmed misogynist.	4.322819788484117
16. holmes rebels against the social	conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds.	5.636500868665733
17. his	eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom.	5.3285636594893
18. it was in order	to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that holmes became	a detective in the first place.	6.891267315594368
19. as he informs watson my life is	spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence.	4.806024495060205
20. these little problems help me to do so.	7.675019828375376
21. holmes is a public servant	to be sure; but the society which he serves bores him to tears.	4.219038752925444
22. the curious relationship between holmes and scotland yard	provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric	behavior.	5.2045335440434215
23. although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with scotland	yard holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality	of the police.	4.388876802914165
24. they for their part are convinced that holmes	is too unorthodox and theoretical to make a good detective.	6.7968013284199404
25. why do the police find holmes unorthodox?	6.2599306038762315
26.  on the face of	it it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official	police routine.	6.642590907313347
27. another more interesting explanation is hinted at by	watson when he observes on several occasions that holmes would have	made a magnificent criminal.	3.9606173010294836
28. the great detective modestly agrees.	8.243889184727871
29. watson's	insight is verified by the mysterious link between holmes	and his arch-opponent dr moriarty.	4.305414028832856
30. the two men resemble each other	closely in their cunning their egotism their relentlessness.	6.014872247591847
31. the	first series of sherlock holmes adventures ends with holmes and moriarty	grappling together on the edge of a cliff.	4.685492672847348
32. they are presumed	to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace.	6.444201577805812
33. linked to holmes	even in death moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great	detective the image of what our hero might have become were he not a	public servant.	3.888948745898811
34. just as holmes the eccentric stands behind holmes the	detective so holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both.	6.074739403816712
35. in the modern english whodunnit this insinuation of	latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared.	4.421519854325321
36. hercule poirot and lord peter whimsey	have retained	holmes'	egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits.	5.454336586728915
37. poirot and	his counterparts are perfectly respectable people; it is true that	they are also extremely dull.	4.538694476440035
38. their dedication to the status quo has	been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism	of a sherlock holmes.	5.932861840593582
39. the latter's real descendents were unable	to take root in england; they fled from the victorian parlor	and made their way across the stormy atlantic.	3.5952062133124953
40. in the american hardboiled	detective story of the '20s and '30s the spirit of the	mad genius from baker street lives on.	6.89338490042854
41. like holmes the	american private eye rejects the social conventions of his time.	4.915570261991866
42. but	unlike holmes he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt.	5.763023142066387
43. surrounded by crime and violence everywhere the hardboiled	private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed	isolation.	3.9378314648561785
44. his alienation is far more acute than holmes'; he	is not an eccentric but rather an outcast.	6.130090302790985
45. with rex stout's nero	wolfe alienation is represented on a purely physical plane.	4.8679888245169085
46. wolfe	refuses to ever leave his own house and spends most of his time drinking	beer and playing with orchids.	5.862034692466262
47. more profound and more disturbing	however is the moral isolation of raymond chandler's philip marlowe.	4.697493264272977
48. in a society where everything is for sale marlowe is the only	man who cannot be bought.	6.378560481820552
49. his tough honesty condemns him to a solitary	and difficult existence.	5.258332511707205
50. beaten bruised and exhausted he pursues	the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low	morals always alone always despised.	5.160513208686437
51. in the end he gets his man but	no one seems to care; virtue is its own and only reward.	4.639577423470684
52. a similar	tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers	of eric ambler and dominates the most famous of all american mystery	stories dashiell hammett's the maltese falcon.	4.848075396919564
53. sam spade	joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled	statue of a falcon; but when the bird is found at last it turns	out to be a fake.	4.227974374873775
54. now the detective must save his own skin by informing	on the girl he loves who is also the real murderer.	6.102736897885947
55. for sam spade	neither crime nor virtue pays; moreover it is increasingly difficult	to distinguish between the two.	4.397746574674534
56. because the private eye	intends to save society in spite of himself he invariably finds himself	in trouble with the police.	6.4725253287241316
57. the latter are either too stupid to	catch the killer or too corrupt to care.	4.2940786852662844
58. in either case they do not	appreciate the private detective's zeal.	7.181769965322449
59. perry mason and hamilton	burger nero wolfe and inspector cramer spend more time fighting	each other than they do in looking for the criminal.	4.00908387037386
60. frequently enough	the police are themselves in league with the killer; dashiell	hammett's	red harvest provides a classic example of this theme.	5.640010460811021
61. but even when the police are honest they do not trust the private	eye.	6.096763368712364
62. he is like phillip marlowe too alienated to be reliable.	7.3218104171203
63. finally	in the maltese falcon among others the clash between detective	and police is carried to its logical conclusion: sam spade	becomes the chief murder suspect.	3.725131536371901
64. in order to exonerate himself he	is compelled to find the real criminal who happens to be his girl friend.	6.654941233312143
65. what was only a vague suspicion in the case of sherlock holmes	now appears as a direct accusation: the private eye is in danger of	turning into his opposite.	4.642143928037869
66. it is the growing contradiction	between individualism and public service in the mystery story which	creates this fatal dilemma.	6.416913129421739
67. by upholding his own personal code of behavior	the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society	whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption.	4.172309061671211
68. that society	responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo	a potential criminal.	6.386333281428085
69. if the detective insists upon retaining his	personal standards he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society.	4.276358589295928
70. he must in short cease to be a detective and become a rebel.	7.692273022735672
71. on the other hand if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession	he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism.	4.291813781288864
72. dashiell hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write	mystery	stories and turning to other pursuits.	5.659455227543579
73. his successors have adopted	the opposite alternative.	5.958640424998724
74. in order to save the mystery story they	have converted the private detective into an organization man.	7.115329907585144
75. the first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by	mickey spillane's mike hammer.	5.123933505978882
76. at first glance this hero seems	to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors.	6.46642973636272
77. for hammer nothing is forbidden.	6.838647334942619
78. he kills when he pleases	takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge jury	and executioner rolled into one.	5.202221248788263
79. it will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in	an organization determine the type of network required because the	type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages	enumerated in table 1.	4.236600823486631
80. great stress is placed on the role that	the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness	of the network.	5.759684258114675
81. by monitoring we mean some system of control	over the types of information sent from the various centers.	4.250802375529208
82. as a word of caution we should be aware that in actual practice no	message is purely one of the four types question command statement	or exclamation.	6.839524598523699
83. for example suppose a man wearing a $200 watch driving	a 1959 rolls royce stops to ask a man on the sidewalk what	time is it?	4.113005580333434
84.  this sentence would have most of the characteristics	of a question but it has some of the characteristics of a statement	because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in	his own timepiece or the one attached to his car.	6.2199572326455606
85. if the man on the	sidewalk is surprised at this question it has served as an exclamation.	4.5310603116709744
86. also since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer	the question	has assumed some measurable properties of a command.	5.530852698708456
87. however for	convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified	according to table 1.	5.029032622238009
88. on this basis certain extreme kinds of networks	will be discussed for illustrative purposes.	6.810877061057646
89. some special types of organization	presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host's desire	to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted	and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy	for future cooperative endeavors.	4.366542727866511
90. the party is usually in a room	small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another.	5.488500579755457
91. the information is furnished by each of the guests is sent by	oral broadcasting over the air waves and is received by the ears.	4.153382604188301
92. since	the air is a continuum the network of communication remains intact	regardless of the positions or motions of the points	in the net.	5.334219345263066
93. as shown in figure 1 there is a connection for communication	between every pair of points.	5.556441106282921
94. this and other qualifications make	the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication	system ever dreamed up.	5.894445684673533
95. all four types of message listed in table	1 are permitted although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding	the commands to a minimum while exclamations having complimentary	intonations are more than customarily encouraged.	3.688788250534449
96. the completeness	of the connections provide that for n people there are f	lines of communication between the pairs which can become a large number	for a party of fifty guests.	4.667581188675998
97. looking at the diagram we	see that f connection lines come in to each member.	4.649114565222547
98. thus the cocktail	party would appear to be the ideal system but there is one weakness.	9.87734291399977
99. in spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group the	f incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond	comprehension if n exceeds about six.	4.090114001444112
100. the crowd consequently	breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six with	a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes.	4.874370579408488
101. for the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else	and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers then	the open house system is advantageous because the honored guests	are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections	at the door.	3.4966617376797364
102. we consider a rural	community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration	is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary	for family subsistence.	5.547965855361084
103. we assume for this illustration that the	size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings	is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication	is between nearest neighbors only as shown in figure 2.	4.278942971381647
104. information	beyond nearest neighbor is carried second- third- and fourth-hand	as a distortable rumor.	5.926734816808145
105. in figure 2 the points in the network are	designated by a letter accompanied by a number.	4.7471799043260035
106. the numbers indicate	the number of nearest neighbors.	6.235712268229572
107. it will be noted that point f	has seven nearest neighbors h and e have six and p	has only one while the remaining points have intermediate numbers.	4.24791099411754
108. in any social system in which communications have an importance	comparable with that of production and other human factors a point	like f in figure 2 would be the dwelling	place for the community leader while e and h would	house the next most important citizens.	5.168706588030362
109. a point like p gets	information directly from n but all information beyond n	is indirectly relayed through n.	3.969810750888568
110. the dweller at p is	last to hear about a new cure the slowest to announce to his neighbors	his urgent distresses the one who goes the farthest to trade and the	one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or	getting people to join him in a cooperative effort.	4.604647067913598
111. since the hazards	of poor communication are so great p can be justified as a habitable	site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made	available by a waterfall for milling purposes a mine or a sugar maple	camp.	3.802941636868106
112. location theorists have given these matters much consideration.	6.806723317680827
113. the networks for military communications	are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be	changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the	addition of new machines of war.	4.10284412684238
114. they also furnish proof that in	modern war message sending must be monitored.	6.669216874232325
115. without monitoring a	military hookup becomes a noisy party.	5.710682204439152
116. the need for monitoring became	greater when radio was adopted for military signaling.	6.2909647459254785
117. alexander the	great who used runners as message carriers did not have to worry about	having every officer in his command hear what he said and having	hundreds of them comment at once.	4.24546844109079
118. as time has passed and science has	progressed the speed of military vehicles has increased the range of	missiles has been extended the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles	has been adopted and the range and breadth of message sending	has increased.	5.265454996989047
119. next to the old problem of the slowness of decision	making network structure seems to be paramount and without monitoring	no network has value.	5.004068093477943
120. on the parade ground the net may be similar	to that shown in figure 3.	6.371624370053186
121. the monitoring is the highest and	most restrictive of any organization in existence.	4.012715720819275
122. no questions statements	or explanations are permitted- only commands.	7.634707380775526
123. commands go only	from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank.	4.816726569302973
124. the same command	is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to	corporal.	6.158202316404318
125. all orders originate with the officer of highest rank and	terminate with action of the men in the ranks.	5.137765817544385
126. even the officer in charge	be it a captain or a general is restrained	by monitoring.	6.55728352058283
127. this is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the	hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility.	4.500740570834292
128. the commands are specified by the military regulations; are	few in number briefly worded all different in sound; and are combinable	into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be	desired on a parade ground.	4.494012173111996
129. this monitoring is necessary because on	a parade ground everyone can hear too much and without monitoring	a confused social event would develop.	3.8848375982832044
130. with troops dispersed	on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground it may seem that	a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines	of communication.	5.27313600315699
131. years ago this was true but with the replacement	of wires or runners by radio and radar these	restrictions have disappeared and now again too much is heard.	4.009542598867207
132. in contrast to cocktail parties military organizations even	in the field are more formal.	6.451727817754432
133. in the extreme and oversimplified example	suggested in figure 3 the organization is more easily understood	and more predictable in behavior.	4.240111483060462
134. a military organization has an objective	chosen by the higher command.	6.226873061589773
135. this objective is adhered to throughout	the duration of the action.	5.00270118030033
136. the connective system or network	is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective and it is therefore	not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated	unit has a different communication network than a factory a college	or a rural village.	5.014499935001889
137. the assumptions upon which the example	shown	in figure 3 is based are: one man can direct about six subordinates	if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not	need too much personal coaching indoctrinating etc.	3.7160281244784725
138. a message	runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more	than about six consecutive times.	6.837309468510877
139. decisions of a general kind	are made by the central command.	5.315542350960959
140. and all action of a physical kind	pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower	rank.	6.06704522442152
141. these assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the	top six directly under him six under each of these and so on until	there are six levels of personnel.	3.9359910990999767
142. the number of people acting as one	body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of f 55987	men.	5.962021021959122
143. this organizational network would be of no avail if there	were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent.	4.040813365261647
144. of types	of message listed in table 1 commands and statements are the only	ones sent through the vertical network shown in figure 3.	5.500084735935524
145. a further	regulation is that commands always go down unaccompanied by statements	and statements always go up unaccompanied by commands.	3.9147703487056127
146. questions	and particularly exclamations are usually channeled along informal	horizontal lines not indicated in figure 3 and seldom are carried	beyond the nearest neighbor.	5.103675880876918
147. it will readily be seen that	in this suggested network	greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than	is usually put into practice.	4.369971273748713
148. furthermore the network in figure	3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics	and the like are interlaced.	5.3518427722789905
149. not discussed here are some	military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare where the	surveillance sending transmitting and receiving are all so inadequate	that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks.	3.9063386102873303
150. such	problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much	like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall	grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they	could teach.	5.061512941749692
151. this is an unsolved	problem which probably has never been seriously investigated although	one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists	of the kind who can compete with the germans or swiss for example	in precision machinery and mathematics or the finns in geochemistry.	3.8633432354291983
152. we hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have	not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine	our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes.	5.235567963784882
153. this problem	of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and	specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis.	3.8974694797130636
154. since	the difficulty of drawing the net is great we will merely discuss	it.	6.35033167163411
155. first we realize that a pure specialist does not exist.	5.530290547994213
156. but	for practical purposes we have people who can be considered as such.	6.48784583646846
157. for example there are persons who are in physical science in the	field of mineralogy trained in crystallography who use only x-rays	applying only the powder technique of x-ray diffraction to clay	minerals only and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating	on the montmorillonites; or persons in the social sciences in the	field of anthropology studying the lung capacity of seven andean	indians.	3.49103094867392
158. so we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more	about less and less as he develops as contrasted to the generalist	who knows less and less about more and more.	5.569380041868006
159. american democratic thought pointed up the relation between the	protestant movement in this country and the development of a social	religion which he called the american democratic faith.	4.930694816698224
160. those familiar	with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the	democratic faith at around 1850.	5.845089776359451
161. and he describes it as a balanced polarity	between the notions of the free individual and what he called	the fundamental law.	4.733032364702819
162. i want to say more about gabriel's so-called	fundamental law.	8.009210549207303
163. but first i want to quote him on the relationship	that he found between religion and politics in this country and	what happened to it.	4.544539028545792
164. he points out that from the time of jackson on	through world war 1 evangelical protestantism was a dominant influence	in the social and political life of america.	6.083944015032079
165. he terms this	early enthusiasm romantic christianity and concludes that its	similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that the doctrine	of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical	protestantism.	3.8103494472244352
166. let me quote him even more fully for his	analysis is important to my theme.	7.098915962070048
167. he says: beside the	protestant philosophy of progress as expressed in radical or conservative	millenarianism should be placed the doctrine of the democratic	faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the united	states to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted	the beacon of democracy.	4.0031194711043465
168. he specifies in the middle period	of the nineteenth century it was colored by christian supernaturalism	in the twentieth century it was affected by naturalism.	6.672297469319921
169. but in	every period it has been humanism.	7.043609515301075
170. and let me add utopianism also.	8.248291530411178
171. some fourteen or fifteen years ago in an essay i called	the leader follows- where?	4.979090899496442
172.  i used his polarity to illustrate	what i thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call	progressivism.	5.67934707496787
173. it seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the	balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law	in the common man.	4.741920396283683
174. that is to say gabriel's fundamental law had been	so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor	law any more.	6.984704817564926
175. it is a weakness of gabriel's analysis that he never	seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been	cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy.	4.199564900472011
176. and	with progressivism the religion of humanity was replacing what gabriel	called christian supernaturalism.	5.96331148341506
177. and the common man was developing	mythic power or charisma on his own.	5.193163005726023
178. during the decade	that followed the common man as that piece put it grew uncomfortable	as the voice of god and fled from behind saint woodrow	only to learn from science to his shocked relief that after all there	was no god he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow-	that there was a chemical formula for him and that too much couldn't	be expected of him.	5.352364378525417
179. the socialism implicit in the slogan	of the roosevelt revolution freedom from want and fear seems a	far cry from the individualism of the first amendment to the constitution	or of the jacksonian frontier.	3.7658413879407986
180. what had happened to the common	man?	9.618125492657587
181.    french egalitarianism had had only nominal influence	in this country before the days of popularism.	4.574278808491521
182. the riotous onrush	of industrialism after the war for southern independence and the general	secular drift to the religion of humanity however prepared	the way for a reception of the french revolution's socialistic offspring	of one sort of another.	4.796371071699456
183. the first of which to find important place	in our federal government was the graduated income tax under wilson.	4.73116314099407
184. moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920s the	dislocations of the depression the common ethos of materialism everywhere	all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced	mike fink and the great gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy	of the little people.	4.888102437991418
185. however it is important to trace the	philosophy of the french revolution to its sources to understand the	common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence	of the latter on the former.	4.287211291950343
186. that john locke's philosophy of	the social contract fathered the american revolution with its declaration	of independence i believe we generally accept.	5.612383356478478
187. yet after	rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion	of the general will the same philosophy it may be said became	the idea source of the french revolution also.	4.224095289580154
188. the importance	of rousseau's twist has not always been clear to us however.	5.390500575037483
189. this	notion of the general will gave rise to the commune of paris in	the revolution and later brought napoleon to dictatorship.	4.275758007467088
190. and it	is clearly argued by lord percy of newcastle in his remarkable long	essay the heresy of democracy and in a more general way by	voegelin in his new science of politics that this same rousseauan	idea descending through european democracy is the source of	marx's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.	4.914590516231284
191. this is important	to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves	in after world war 2 and our great democratic victory	that brought no peace.	4.523137096396854
192. the long road that had taken liberals in	this country into the social religion of democracy into a worship of	man led logically to the marxist dream of a classless society under	a socialist state.	4.773269645608744
193. and the ussr existed as the revolutionary	experiment in radical socialism the ultimate exemplar.	4.88380238970701
194. and by the	time the war ended liberal leadership in this country was spiritually	marxist.	7.194262199934479
195. we will recall that the still confident liberals of	the truman administration gathered with other western utopians in	san francisco to set up the legal framework finally and at last to	rationalize war- to rationalize want and fear- out of the world:	the united nations.	3.903127059558352
196. we of the liberal-led world got all set for peace	and rehabilitation.	7.399416397589123
197. then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle	of another fight an irrational an indecent an undeclared and immoral	war with our strongest ally.	3.9791913295474415
198. during the next five years the leaders of the fair deal reluctantly	backed down from the optimistic expectations of the new deal.	7.321323525209197
199. during	the next five years liberal leaders in the united states sank in	the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative	policy of containment- and the bitterest irony- enforced and enforceable	only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste	for but could not abandon: the atom bomb.	3.725647486881932
200. in 1952 it will be remembered	the gop without positive program campaigned on the	popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly.	5.943595135629777
201. all of this i know is recent history familiar to you.	5.885166798098334
202. but	i have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common	man to point up what happened to him under eisenhower's leadership.	5.569456967524205
203. a perceptive journalist sam lubell has phrased it in the	title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates.	4.499724966204575
204. he opens	his discourse however with a review of the eisenhower inaugural	festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents	all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age.	5.167271125877626
205. the	show was colorful indeed exuberant but the press for all its assiduity	could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny.	4.02666334586159
206. lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue.	6.794121879695618
207. and i select this sentence as its pertinent summation: in essence	the drama of his presidency can be described	as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling- thus far	with but limited and precarious success- to give effective voice	and force to that conservatism.	3.569183990754835
208. i will assume that we are	all aware of the continuing struggle with its limited and precarious	success toward conservatism.	6.39214701188648
209. it has moved on various levels it has	been clamorous and confused.	5.402898008017697
210. obviously there has been no agreement on	what american conservatism is or rather what it should be.	6.827724172229038
211. for it	was neglected not to say nascent when the struggle began.	5.253209510296175
212. i saw a	piece the other day assailing william buckley author of man and	god at yale and publisher of the national review as no conservative	at all but an old liberal.	5.48061125237986
213. i would agree with this view.	7.274152519947203
214. but	i'm not here to define conservatism.	7.603896187885215
215. what i am here to do	is to report on the gyrations of the struggle- a struggle that amounts	to self-redefinition- to see if we can predict its future course.	4.342141107365653
216. one of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of	the last election i suppose is that we the majority were dissatisfied	with eisenhower conservatism.	6.137908277040843
217. though to be sure we gave kennedy	no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment.	5.0008559329602695
218. this is however symptomatic of our national malaise.	8.494633285968535
219. but before i	try to diagnose it i would offer other evidence.	4.888956353788511
220. i will mention two	volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year.	6.708487786879644
221. the earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise sponsored by life	magazine under the title of the national purpose.	4.560192035024163
222. the contributors	to this testament were all well-known: a former democratic	candidate for president a new deal poet the magazine's chief	editorial writer two newspaper columnists head of a national broadcasting	company a popular protestant evangelist etc.	4.561085688268358
223. what i want	to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals or modified liberals	with perhaps one exception.	5.777562320037943
224. i suppose we might classify billy	graham as an old liberal.	7.164207487232489
225. and i would further note that they all-	with one exception again- sang in one key or another the same song.	4.397190338822279
226. its refrain was: let us return to the individualistic democracy	of our forefathers for our salvation.	6.562618782261992
227. adlai stevenson	expressed some reservations about this return.	5.3285636594893
228. others invoked technology	and common sense.	9.825581183934137
229. only walter lippman envisioned the possibility	of our having outlived most of what we used to regard as the program	of our national purposes.	4.356567835142637
230. but the most notable thing about	the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth	of socialism was conspicuously absent.	6.201433326045636
231. the second specific	comment was the report of eisenhower's commission on national	goals titled goals for americans.	4.437559118453341
232. they perhaps gave the pitch	of their position in the preface where it was said that eisenhower	requested that the commission be administered by the american assembly	of columbia university because it was non-partisan.	5.31115681521406
233. the	commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what i would call the	unconscious liberal but not unconscious enough to invoke the now	taboo symbolism of socialism.	3.692532313021866
234. and here again we hear the same refrain	mentioned above: the paramount goal of the united states	h set long ago h was to guard the rights of the individual h ensure	his development h enlarge his opportunity.	5.520736384132578
235. this group is secularist	and their program tends to be technological.	5.792633587259352
236. but it is	the need to undertake these testaments that i would submit here as	symptom of the common man's malaise.	6.670387060503833
237. and let me add murray's new	book as another symptom of it particularly so in view of the attention	time magazine gave it when it came out recently.	4.243377106782332
238. father murray	goes back to the declaration of independence too though i may	add with considerably more historical perception.	6.563213785040622
239. i will reserve	discussion of it for a moment however to return to president kennedy.	6.079188430340235
240. as symptomatic of the common man's malaise he is most significant:	a liberal and a catholic elected by the skin of his teeth.	5.612327288473889
241. does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy not to say confused	state of the public mind?	4.786055715847796
242.    what is the common man's	complaint?	11.834716641108068
243.  let's take a panoramic look back over the course we	have come.	4.535752126583474
244. has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism	up until the turning back under eisenhower?	5.638119140232106
245.  and the basic character	of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic.	5.043811773693913
246. ralph	gabriel gave it the name of protestant philosophy of progress.	7.3153663617283256
247. but	there's a subjective side to that utopian outlook.	5.066959048406199
248. does our society have a runaway uncontrollable growth of	technology which may end our civilization or a normal healthy growth?	5.71173842559353
249. 	here there may be an analogy with cancer: we can detect cancers	by their rapidly accelerating growth determinable only when related	to the more normal rate of healthy growth.	4.022950019818483
250. should the accelerating	growth of technology then warn us?	7.644177729071336
251.  noting such evidence is the first	step; and almost the only cure is early detection and removal.	4.2428826407164335
252. one way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology	would be to check the strength of our society's organs to see if their	functioning is as healthy as before.	5.796730920774668
253. so an objective look at our	present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous	situation.	4.3703990134474155
254. in any event whether society may have cancer or merely	a virus infection the disease we shall find is political	economical social and even medical.	5.541690327543543
255. have not our physical abilities	already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now	living?	5.825600469173731
256.  hence the prime issue as i see it is whether a democratic	or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind	or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible	with its own needs as a force of nature.	5.175546488406842
257. we are already committed	to establishing man's supremacy over nature and everywhere	on earth not merely in the limited social-political-economical context	we are fond of today.	4.117928157721877
258. otherwise we go on endlessly trying to draw	the line color and other as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate.	5.477056434065888
259. we have proved so able to solve technological problems that to	contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is	to be extremely shortsighted if nothing else.	3.926696883262048
260. we must believe we have	the ability to affect our own destinies: otherwise why try anything?	6.332678008838961
261. 	so in these pages the term technology is used to include any	and all means which could amplify project or augment man's control	over himself and over other men.	3.8064272287402767
262. naturally this includes all communication	forms eg languages or any social political economic	or religious structures employed for such control.	5.621873948309561
263. properly mindful	of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world we must	employ these resources without war or violent revolution.	4.0214460149307305
264. if	we were creating a wholly new society we could insist that our social	political economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than	hamper man; best growth.	5.105125264061747
265. but we cannot start off with a clean slate.	6.724734441356897
266. so we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to	the effect of each on man's major needs.	6.041272678012878
267. asked which institution	most needs correction i would say the corporation as it exists in america	today.	4.682493446117441
268. at first glance this appears strange: of all people	was not america founded by rugged individualists who established a new	way of life still inspiring undeveloped societies abroad?	5.3608858112375835
269.  but	hear harrison e salisbury former moscow correspondent of the	new york times and author of to moscow- and beyond.	4.2085365830281845
270. in a book review of the soviet cultural offensive he says	long before the state department organized its bureaucracy into	an east-west contacts staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive	within soviet borders the sharp cutting-edge of american	culture had carved its mark across the russian steppes as when the enterprising	promoters of 'porgy and bess' overrode the state department	to carry the contemporary 'cultural warfare' behind the	enemy lines.	4.9729216868061625
271. they were not diplomats or jazz musicians or even organizers	of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays but rugged capitalist	entrepreneurs like henry ford hugh cooper thomas campbell	the international harvester co and david w griffith.	3.8391384994176274
272. their	kind created an american culture superior to any in the world an	industrial and technological culture which penetrated russia as it did	almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the federal	treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or	program a series of consultations of interested agencies.	5.426459220126896
273. this favorable	image of america in the minds of russian men and women is still	there despite years of energetic anti-american propaganda h	perhaps the public's present attitude	toward business stems from the fact that the rugged capitalist entrepreneur	no more exists in america.	4.38794163494155
274. in his stead is a milquetoast	version known as the corporation.	8.37016049941636
275. but even if we cannot see	the repulsive characteristics in this new image of america foreigners	can; and our loss of prestige abroad is the direct result.	4.212946705642411
276. no amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts.	7.7011564840833655
277. if we want respect	from ourselves or others we will have to earn it.	6.185805298930438
278. first let us	realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times now	the corporation per se cannot take economic leadership.	5.560877949001169
279. businesses	must develop as a result of the ideas energies and ambitions of an	individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind.	4.462330075436692
280. when we forced individuals to assume the corporate structure	by means of taxes and other legal statutes we adopted what i would	term pseudo-capitalism and so took a major step toward socialism.	5.155974627451894
281. the biggest loss of course was the individual's lessened desire	and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and	our economy.	4.0453935335719935
282. socialism i grant has a definite place in our society.	6.289010577019261
283. but let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to	a form that is not truly capitalistic.	4.5110665947081054
284. some forms of capitalism do indeed	work- superb organizations a credit to any society.	6.156002654076167
285. but the pseudo-capitalism	which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics	and social life will not stand close scrutiny.	4.726709562924424
286. its pretense to operate	in the public interest is little more than a sham.	7.809389888590825
287. it serves	only its own stockholders and poorly at that.	5.48553146339856
288. as a creative enterprise	its abilities are primarily in swallowing creative enterprises	developed outside its own organization	.	6.205049250636099
289. as to benefits to employees it is notorious	for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services.	4.3097642784137244
290. the corporation in america is in reality our form of socialism	vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged	within governmental bureaucracy.	5.641829999577389
291. but while the corporation has all	the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization	it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its	unluckily it	does not have the desirable aspect of socialism the motivation to operate	for the benefit of society as a whole.	3.692958773174644
292. so we are faced with a	vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever	manner they can without regard to the needs of society controlling	society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation's	needs for survival.	5.531321959611855
293. the corporation has a limited specific	place in our society.	4.5884307043269414
294. ideally speaking it should be allowed to operate	only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply	or services and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary	to the needs of society.	5.900077004489296
295. examples are in public utilities making	military aircraft and accessories or where the investment and risk	for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible	to achieve by any means other than the corporate form eg	constructing major airports or dams.	3.592304240653621
296. thus if corporations are not	to run away with us they must become quasi-governmental institutions	subject to public control and needs.	5.739187692485559
297. in all other areas private initiative	of the proprietorship type should be urged to produce the	desired goods and services.	4.369008233722511
298. avoiding runaway	technology can be done only by assuring a humane society; and for this	human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our	society rests.	5.529207946933141
299. such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can	offer corporations cannot.	5.521911988567937
300. it can project long-range goals for itself.	9.260410570929535
301. corporations react violently to short-range stimuli e g	quarterly and annual dividend reports.	4.411891185517149
302. proprietorships can establish	a unity and integrity of control; corporations being more amorphous	cannot.	5.926734816808145
303. proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity representing	a human personality and thus establish sincere relationships with	customers and community.	3.996502389132312
304. corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal	inhumane shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated	a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public.	5.277774918328408
305. the	proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate	structure with its board of directors and stockholders.	4.904461480356293
306. leadership is	lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop.	6.325355777582214
307. men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences	of the most varied complicated and trying type so that at maturation	they have developed the competence and willingness to accept	the personal responsibility so sorely needed now.	3.740172430631257
308. hence government	must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their	activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest.	6.301510217712498
309. proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations	e g the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth.	4.022058679018191
310. corporations should pay added taxes to be used for educational purposes	.	7.573161969763394
311. the right to leave legacies	should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated.	5.244112549689465
312. to perpetuate	wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no	role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to	the fore and is basically anti-democratic.	5.051443222770688
313. when the proprietor dies	the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired	by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it.	4.1873610589744885
314. strikes	should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements	would have to be settled by government representatives acting as	controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would	now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors	must be completely interdependent as they are each a part of the	whole.	5.402021784401858
315. strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship if internally	motivated prevent a healthy relationship.	4.305414028832856
316. certainly external	forces	should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to	do so.	6.333679340416276
317. if we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system how can	we expect to abolish it internationally?	4.794710811229831
318. 	these proposals would go far toward creating the economic	atmosphere favoring growth of the individual who in turn would help	us to cope with runaway technology.	6.02213621140942
319. individual human strength is	needed to pit against an inhuman condition.	4.681571082223364
320. the battle is not easy.	6.915495430243132
321. we are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them	straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible	of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed	enlightened competent leaders.	4.076809845341756
322. persons developed in to-day's corporations	cannot hope to serve here- a judgment based on experiences	of my own in business and in activities outside.	5.081898203430707
323. in my own company in	effect a partnership although legally a corporation i have been able	to do many things for my employees which normal corporations	of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do.	4.205747271786672
324. also i	am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of	a partnership i would have been even abler to solve long-range problems	for myself and my fellow-employees.	5.514588357094918
325. any abilities i may have were	achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the	growth and control of my business coupled with raising my family.	3.8843570124194655
326. this	combined experience on a foundation of very average i assure you	intelligence and background has helped me do things many well-informed	people would bet heavily against.	4.96038068518468
327. perhaps a list of some of the practices	of my company will help here.	6.524236931432727
328. the company grew	out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties	neither having a formal education applicable to or experience in	manufacturing or selling our type of articles.	4.869850908132264
329. from an initial investment	of $1200 in 1943 it has grown with no additional capital investment	to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10000000	.	3.9244009846871655
330. its growth	continues steadily on a par with past growth; and no limitation is	in evidence.	6.081289519572102
331. our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance	in just a few years time despite substantial well established competition.	4.8527480743268425
332. during the last years of woodrow wilson's administration	a red scare developed in our country.	6.978117469609071
333. many americans reacted irrationally	to the challenge of russia and turned to the repression of	ideas by force.	4.826198380951718
334. postmaster general burleson set about to protect the	american people against radical propaganda that might be spread through	the mails.	5.729399376078681
335. attorney general palmer made a series of raids that	sent more than 4000 so-called radicals to the jails in direct violation	of their constitutional rights.	4.077381574066957
336. then not many years later the	un-american activities committee under the leadership of martin	dies pilloried hundreds of decent patriotic citizens.	5.8036345518141
337. anyone who	tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy	was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction	of our government.	4.358344360967275
338. this hysteria reached its height under the	leadership of senator joseph mccarthy.	6.235752476069656
339. demagogues of this sort found	communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter	to stereotyped notions.	4.215933312992338
340. new ideas were dangerous and must be repressed	no matter how.	8.016576391968199
341. those who would suppress dangerous thoughts	credit ideas with high potency.	6.1120758282257945
342. they give strict interpretation to	william james' statement that every idea that enters the mind	tends to express itself.	5.582512640258034
343. they seem to believe that a person will	act automatically as soon as he contacts something new.	5.520120433881872
344. hence the only	defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion unless it	gives evidence that it is perfectly safe.	6.676696753186417
345. despite this danger	however we are informed on every hand that ideas not machines are	our finest tools; they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded	on a ledger page; they are the most valuable of commodities-	and the most salable for their demand far exceeds supply.	3.785158769852424
346. so all-important	are ideas we are told that persons successful in business and	happy in social life usually fall into two classes: those who invent	new ideas of their own and those who borrow beg or steal from others.	5.310901323648455
347. seemingly with an unrestricted flow of ideas all will	be well and we are even assured that an idea a day will keep the sheriff	away.	3.789642360841507
348. that however may also bring the police if the thinking	does not meet with social approval.	6.033056678436821
349. criminals as well as model	citizens exercise their minds.	6.418051495076567
350. merely having a mental image of some	sort is not the all-important consideration.	7.367526524370932
351. of course there	must be clarity: a single distinct impression is more valuable than	many fuzzy ones.	4.627734556351686
352. but clarity is not enough.	9.085383511981039
353. the writer took a class	of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in st	joseph missouri.	4.058572397612134
354. an inmate a former university professor expounded	to us logically and clearly that someone was pilfering his thoughts.	5.692339211022675
355. he appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities	that justice might be done.	4.581780941925668
356. despite the clarity of his presentation	his idea was not of einsteinian calibre.	7.296788644556663
357. true ideas	are important perhaps life's most precious treasures.	5.777110630666325
358. but have we	not gone overboard in stressing their significance?	7.003053509347795
359.  have we not actually	developed idea worship?	7.124310897919756
360.    ideas we must have and we seek	them everywhere.	7.632551357520395
361. we scour literature for them; here we find stored	the wisdom of great minds.	4.629594649939228
362. but are all these works worthy of consideration?	7.358765780958141
363. 	can they stand rigid scrutiny?	6.094118058689911
364.    shakespeare's	wit and wisdom his profound insight into human nature have stood the	test of centuries.	5.659455227543579
365. but was he infallible in all things?	5.797972002787348
366.  what of	his treatment of the jew in the merchant of venice?	7.457074712751026
367. 	shakespeare	gives us a vivid picture of shylock but probably he never saw a	jew unless in some of his travels.	4.436362627125688
368. the jews had been banished from	england in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 when	shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years.	4.909115568581044
369. if any had escaped	expulsion by hiding they certainly would not frequent the market-place.	4.960475982174043
370. shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays	but borrowed them from old stories ballads and plays wove them	together and then breathed into them his spark of life.	4.805980645130889
371. rather than	from a first-hand study of jewish people his delineation of shylock	stems from a collection of italian stories il pecorone published	in 1558	although written almost two centuries earlier.	4.012229952268303
372. he could	learn at second hand from books but could not thus capture the real	jewish spirit.	5.857693230903877
373. harris j griston in shaking the dust from	shakespeare writes: there is not a word spoken by shylock	which one would expect from a real jew.	4.497359112106846
374. he took the	story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone.	6.3573189914981585
375. the jew	was the safest victim.	5.148617142042534
376. no jew was on hand to boycott his financially	struggling theater.	7.7059975302344865
377. it would have been unwise policy for instance	to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty scotchman.	5.488919322669453
378. just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of mars or even	of tikopia and no senatorial investigation will result.	5.706846978060975
379. who cares	about them!   shakespeare does not tell us that shylock was an	aberrant individual.	4.778082582126665
380. he sets him forth as being typical of the group.	6.78360114384952
381. he tells of his jewish heart- not a shylockian heart;	but a jewish heart.	4.428220463529652
382. this would make anyone crafty and cruel capable	of fiendish revenge.	7.25662154645442
383. there is no justification for such misrepresentation.	6.741888174255619
384. if living jews were unavailable for study the bible	was at hand.	6.731712716900033
385. reading the old testament would have shown the dramatist	that the ideas attributed to shylock were abhorrent to the jews.	4.07658381667691
386. are we better off for having shakespeare's idea of shylock?	7.628134269217994
387. 	studying the merchant of venice in high school and college	has given many young people their notions about jews.	4.53244349019731
388. does this help	the non-jew to understand this group?	8.254298215613153
389.    thomas de torquemada	inquisitor-general of the spanish inquisition put many persons	to death.	4.740401347464201
390. his name became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty.	7.495858562177517
391. would	we gain by keeping alive his memory and besmirching today's roman	catholics by saying he had a catholic heart?	4.323597399763842
392.  let his bones and	his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong; he is	out of place in our times.	5.626882777678753
393. shakespeare's shylock too is of dubious	value in the modern world.	5.018534789406016
394. ideas in and of themselves are	not necessarily the greatest good.	6.289010577019261
395. a successful businessman recently	prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all	economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where	they and their theories might rot together.	3.7337980897601657
396. will his words come	to be treasured and quoted through the years?	6.857220362936742
397.    frequently we	are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted	and in the end only the good ones will survive.	4.316874862455529
398. but is that not	like going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring out liquids	and powders from an array of bottles and then after stirring expecting	a new wonder drug inevitably to result?	5.0794247273757565
399.    what of the efficiency	of this natural instrument of free discussion?	5.226306406730656
400.  is there some	magic in it that assures results?	8.652016304207722
401.    when peter b kyne	informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive	dislike for the japanese did the heated debates of the californians	settle the truth or falsity of the proposition?	3.847719523496325
402.    the	leopard's spots came from the pen of thomas dixon in 1902	and in this he announced an unchangeable law.	5.829360554885174
403. if a child had	a single drop of negro blood he would revert to the ancestral line which	except as slaves under a superior race had not made one step of	progress in 3000 years.	3.856857340852151
404. that doctrine has been accepted by many but	has it produced good results?	6.543411409695642
405.    in the same vein a certain	short-story plot has been overworked.	6.036658669593168
406. the son and heir of a prominent	family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of	her finger nails.	5.5403310753232065
407. in time she presents her aristocratic husband with	a coal-black child.	5.111633708755669
408. is the world better for having this idea thrust upon	it?	8.031646573088828
409.  will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity?	5.564802744233753
410. 	for answers to such questions we must turn to the anthropologists	the biologists the historians the psychologists and the sociologists.	5.490937834041936
411. long ago they consigned the notions of kyne and dixon to the scrap	heap.	4.73626395038947
412. false ideas surfeit another sector of our life.	7.089841267945196
413. for	several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship.	5.0796757809000415
414. the stepmother almost without exception has been presented	as a cruel ogress.	5.506908456901043
415. children conditioned by this mistaken notion	have feared stepmothers while adults by their antagonistic attitudes	have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one.	3.9905686328264047
416. debate	is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild	a happier one.	6.346871299028434
417. research on the other hand has shown many stepmothers	to be eminently successful some far better than the real mothers.	4.828292740750911
418. helen deutsch informed us	that in all cultures the term 'stepmother'	automatically evokes deprecatory implications a conclusion accepted	by many.	5.368720319504203
419. will mere debate on that proposition even though it be	free and untrammeled remove the dross and leave a residue of refined	gold?	4.389896519463562
420.  that is questionable to say the least.	8.957861795896598
421. research into several	cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one.	5.34204388271798
422. most	assuredly ideas are invaluable.	8.978076491592427
423. but ideas just for the sake of having	them are not enough.	5.291128941791104
424. in the 1930's cures for the depression literally	flooded washington.	7.1278079600476945
425. for a time the president received hundreds	of them every day most of them worthless.	6.193536553063118
426. ideas need to be	tested and not merely by argument and debate.	6.693413162276938
427. when some question arises	in the medical field concerning cancer for instance we do not	turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign.	4.059293662251131
428. we have	recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory.	7.172454775627937
429. the	merits of the salk anti-polio vaccine were not established on the	forensic platform or in newspaper editorials but in the laboratory	and by tests in the field on thousands of children.	4.119284994968473
430. our presidential	campaigns provide much debate and argument.	7.980997087745906
431. but is the result	new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence	solve our domestic and international problems?	4.602507267281483
432.  man we are	told is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from	bad.	6.588160950671553
433. but what a super-herculean task it is to winnow anything of value	from the mud-beplastered arguments used so freely particularly since	such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes in themselves	declarations of intellectual bankruptcy.	3.9523844582432153
434. we are reminded however	that freedom of thought and discussion the unfettered exchange	of ideas is basic under our form of government.	5.794073306306094
435. assuredly in	our political campaigns there is freedom to think to examine any and	all issues and to speak without restraint.	3.9232053341390984
436. but	have the results been heartening?	8.18656221502958
437.  may we state with confidence that	in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security?	4.099633098637963
438. 	we must not forget to be sure that free discussion and debate	have produced beneficial results.	6.795696819098287
439. in truth we can say that this broke	the power of senator joseph mccarthy who was finally exposed	in full light to the american people.	4.281980526592391
440. if he had been liquidated	in some way he would have become a martyr a rallying point for people	who shared his ideas.	7.388609738578666
441. debate in the political arena can be productive	of good.	4.908640007301714
442. but it is a clumsy and wasteful process: it can produce	negative results but not much that is positive.	7.185476579989451
443. debate rid us of	mccarthy but did not give us much that is positive.	5.029792563993042
444. it did something	to clear the ground but it erected no striking new structure; it	did not even provide the architect's plan for anything new.	5.3412299895949245
445. in the field of the natural sciences scientifically verified data are	quite readily available and any discussion can be shortened with good	results.	4.655032325141435
446. in the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of	tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage.	7.457697337550438
447. by no means would we discourage the production of ideas:	they provide raw materials with which to work; they provide stimulations	that lead to further production.	4.598452185023279
448. we would establish no censorship.	10.646346090327292
449. the president's personality would have opened that office to him.	4.200697917275358
450. and for the first time a representative of the highest office in the	land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make	it a successorship by inheritance.	7.410635955511674
451. it is testimony to the deep respect	in which mr eisenhower was held by members of all parties that	the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were	not explicitly to be broached.	3.841815967878854
452. these began to be apparent in a	press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting	specialists might clarify the president's condition for the	nation.	5.6089285426202355
453. and if howard rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate	the ethics of the medical profession his article in the atlantic	monthly accomplished a good deal more.	4.5578135093574605
454. it forced us to fix the responsibility	for the position in which all medical commentators had been	placed.	6.052599766277777
455. the discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded	us that in the historical perspective the president's decision will	finally clarify itself as a moral rather than a medical problem.	4.029552579716923
456. because	the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the president	rather than with his doctors nothing raises more surely for us	the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems	under political pressure.	4.86658010936621
457. for the president had dealt with the	matter humbly in what he conceived as the democratic way.	4.878416799075077
458. but the	problem is one which gives us the measure of a man rather than a group	of men whether a group of doctors a group of party members assembled	at a dinner to give their opinion or the masses of the voters.	5.7845766491081605
459. any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central issue in	the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive	it as the central issue will at least resolve our confusions about the	chaotic and misleading results of the earnestness of both doctors and	president in a situation which should never have arisen.	4.01796779291438
460. it was a	response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition	which resulted in attempts at prediction.	5.910703310745432
461. in no other situation	would a group of doctors struggling competently to improve the life	expectancy of a man beloved by the world be subjected to such merciless	and persistent questioning and before they were prepared to demonstrate	the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind	the problems it faces.	3.6726142901433643
462. and though we can look back now and see their	errors we can look back also to the ultimate error.	5.546666558647055
463. it recurred	in the press conferences: the president's remarks about his running	developed a singular tone one which we find in few statements	made by public individuals on such a matter.	3.8924613163404143
464. the press conference became	a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking rather than	his convictions.	5.179076612968885
465. he commented- thoughtfully a reporter told us-	that it was not too important for the individual how he ends up.	4.390469241873004
466. he gave us a simile to explain his admission that even at the worst	period of his second illness it never occurred to him there was any	renewed question about his running: as in the battle of the bulge	he had no fears about the outcome until he read the american newspapers.	5.288882106295726
467. yet the attitude that the fate of the presidency demands in such	a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed	with battles to be fought regardless of the consequences.	4.042361556991696
468. in this	case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears.	7.30564286469221
469. the	presidency demands an incisive awareness of the larger implications	of the death of any incumbent.	5.283874721796487
470. it is of the utmost importance to the	people of america and of the world how their governing president ends	up during the four years of his term.	6.81061730925989
471. only when that term is	ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom	and the courage to discount the dangers of his death.	4.502805911465795
472. ironically enough	in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury.	6.328219112561903
473. at	the national and international level then what is the highest kind	of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political	immorality.	4.1999034983478225
474. and we had the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the	moral and the political progressed amid the events which concern us.	5.913512036697489
475. for the tone of the editorials which greeted mr eisenhower's	original announcement of his running had been strangely disquieting.	4.376226280713762
476. neither the vibrant enthusiasm which bespeaks a people's intuitive	sense of the fitness of things at climactic moments nor the vital argumentation	betraying its sense that something significant has transpired	was in evidence.	5.0456458315219805
477. nothing testifies more clearly to that cleavage than	the peculiar editorial page appearing in a july issue of life magazine	the issue which also carried the second announcement of the	candidacy.	3.813413654810405
478. the double editorial on two aspects of the u s	spirit was subtly calculated to suggest a moral sanction for gambles	great as well as small reflecting popular approval of this questionable	attitude toward the highest office in the land.	5.170573946827415
479. the moral	creed and the will to risk live happily together if we	do not examine where the line is to be drawn.	3.980022550360199
480. i may possibly be a	greater risk than is the normal person of my age the president had	said on february 29th of the election year ignoring the fact that	no one of his age had ever lived out another term.	5.050084459498972
481. my doctors assure	me that this increased percentage of risk is not great.	4.7848397027513805
482. but by	the time the risk was doubled events had dismissed from his mind both	increased percentages and a previously stated intention of considering	carefully anything more serious than a bout of influenza.	4.889927286386058
483. only infrequently	did the situation color his thinking.	6.257549499398021
484. ironically no president	we have had would have regretted more than president eisenhower the	possibility to which his own words in the press conference held at	the beginning of august testified: that unable as he was himself	to say his running was best for the country unconsciously he had placed	his party before his nation.	4.729488033212702
485. so it is that we relive his opening	statement in the first television address with the dramatic immediacy	of the present.	5.663005591113364
486. no consideration of risk urges itself upon him	now: for this is what the mind does with the ideas on which it has not	properly focussed.	6.281944856149096
487. yet with a mind less shallow if less sharp than	some of the fortune-happy syndicates which back him he feels what	he cannot formulate; and we watch him amid the overtones which suggest	he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the voters.	3.4802359437154844
488. moving	as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of	him he adopts a position that is morally indefensible.	5.22382164177904
489. he ascribes	to the mercy of god the peace which this personal matter- the assurance	that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer	than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do-	has brought him.	4.137885500129091
490. what is simply an opinion formed in defiance of the	laws of human probability whether or not it is later confirmed has	become by september of the election year a firm conviction.	5.694649366116316
491. as	a means of silencing a discussion which ought to have taken place the	statement is an effective one: we sympathize with the universal confusion	which gives rise to such convictions.	3.9027196485388536
492. but it is also the climax	to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history.	8.61244341168056
493. in assigning to god the responsibility which he learned could	not rest with his doctors eisenhower gave evidence of that weakening	of the moral intuition which was to characterize his administration	in the years to follow.	3.653096281152304
494. in any other man this reassurance to the electorate	would have caused us a profound moral shock.	6.07472526752081
495. about this man we	had to think twice.	6.207420141660314
496. we knew that it was as reassurance the ironic	fruit of a deeply moral nature.	6.847653787830493
497. but the fact remains that even the unconscious	acceptance of himself as a man of destiny divinely protected	must be censored in any man who evades the responsibility for his major	decisions and thus for imposing his will on the people.	4.290166611160551
498. and in the	context of drifting personal utterances we have examined there was	occasional evidence of the origin of all such evasions.	5.928166786862054
499. when the possibility	that he had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision	seemed	to disconcert his questioners mr eisenhower was known to	make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going	to talk about the matter any more.	4.208677120458013
500. thinking had stopped; it was not	to be resumed.	6.806723317680827
501. the portrait that had developed fragmentarily	but consistently was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking	is alien enough that the making of a decision inhibits when it does not	forestall any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence.	3.9266702639331332
502. this does not mean that the decision to run for office should	inevitably have been revoked.	6.833616861303515
503. instead it means that the thinking in	which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the	decision as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative	attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered	might have done.	4.118079853649343
504. drifting through a third illness apparently	without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency	other than a talk with the vice-president eisenhower revealed the singularly	static quality of his thinking.	4.949478974674249
505. despite three warnings no	sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish his situation and	thus his responsibilities from wilson's.	4.250527342589094
506. by contrast the	energetic reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision imposes	upon him strengthens the moral intuition and gives us the measure	of the man.	5.495887886026438
507. only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed	considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention	to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality	in the major decision are effectively to be checked.	3.9185164689571437
508. in the	incessant struggle with recalcitrant political fact he learns to focus	the essence of a problem in the significant detail and to articulate	the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant with what	is sometimes astounding rapidity.	5.1165147261182105
509. like lincoln he can distinguish	his relation to god from the constitutional responsibilities a questionable	decision exacts of him.	4.3396113034002575
510. like roosevelt he can distinguish an	attitude toward a russian leader he may share with a host of americans	from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may impose upon him.	5.245506757996035
511. he chooses to subordinate one to the other sometimes reluctantly	accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed.	4.753418289012987
512. the very	nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads to the	valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader.	4.698723859097317
513. the capacity for making the distinctions of which diplomacy is compact	and the facility with language which can render them into validity	in the eyes of other men are the leader's means for transforming the	moral intuition into moral leadership.	3.541882303977171
514. the making of distinctions	like the perception of the great distinctions made is an inordinately	difficult business.	6.001018188517631
515. lincoln's slow progress towards the several	marking his achievement is even now unrecognizable as such and loosely	interpreted as the alternation of inconsistency with vision.	3.777206378781194
516. but	because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other	by means of the capacities with which words endow it we do not unwisely	examine the type of distinction in the sphere of politics on which	decisions hang.	5.782470114693109
517. only recently and perhaps because a television debate	can so effectively dramatize president kennedy's extraordinary	mastery of detail have the abilities on which the capacity for making	distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of	politics.	4.0131149312663945
518. in his recent evaluation of kennedy's potentialities for	leadership walter lippmann has cited the precision of his mind	his immense command of factual detail and his instinct for	the crucial point as impressive in the extreme; and it is surely	clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the	individual's command of language interacts with the other two.	5.91321888224582
519. for this change is not a change from one positive position to another	but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation.	4.511407658978617
520. the	liberal-conservative	division we might observe in passing is not of itself	directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle	between ruling groups.	5.51250816386447
521. rather it is rooted in a difference of response	to the threat of social disintegration.	4.914727848790595
522. the division is not between	those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change.	6.600599335715112
523. rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways	of thought with regard to man's life in society.	4.831253758492405
524. these ways are	absolutely irreconcilable because they offer two different recipes for	man's redemption from chaos.	5.926388378734927
525. the civilizational crisis the	third type of change raises the question what are we to do?	3.960945817527352
526. 	on the most primitive level.	8.18656221502958
527. for the answer cannot be derived from any	socially cohesive element in the disrupting community.	4.916964956023117
528. there is no	socially existential answer to the question.	9.156840330164158
529. for the truth formerly experienced	by the community no longer has existential status in the community	nor does any answer elaborated by philosophers or theoriticians.	4.058172256552045
530. in this phase of change no idea has social acceptance and so none	has ontological status in the community.	5.814053034320085
531. an interregnum ensues in which	not men but ideas compete for existence.	4.8657498275719115
532. if we examine the	three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure	we find an additional profound difference between the third and the	first two one that accounts for the notable difference between the	responses they evoke.	5.759753578221466
533. the first two types of change occur within the	inward and immanent structure of the society.	5.0451672426647445
534. the first involves a simple	shift of interests in the society.	6.635711301278465
535. the second involves something	deeper but its characteristic form focuses on a shift in policy for	the community not in the truth on which the community rests.	4.3051318996812045
536. thus in	both types attention is focused on the community itself and its phenomenological	life.	6.335376808678853
537. the third type however wrenches attention from	the life of action and interests in the community and focuses it on the	ground of being on which the community depends for its existence.	3.9630194142788775
538. voegelin	has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable healthy	community.	8.227171719488092
539. there the community faced with the need to formulate policy	on the level of absolute justice can find the answer to its problem	in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced.	4.4859273413717835
540. this	however cannot be done by a community whose very experience of truth	is confused and incoherent: it has no absolute standard and consequently	cannot distinguish the absolute from the contingent.	5.121934330609104
541. it has	lost its ground of being and floats in a mist of appearances.	4.726305979836047
542. relativism	and equality are its characteristic diseases.	7.603896187885215
543. precisely at the moment	when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out	from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure	itself.	4.124226519378827
544. for paradigmatic history breaks rather than unfolds	precisely when the movement is from order to disorder and not from	one order to a new order.	5.64069330826276
545. the liberal-conservative split to define	it further derives from a basic difference concerning the existential	status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads	to its identification.	3.652991529258859
546. when disruptive change has penetrated	to the third level of social order the process of disruption rapidly	reaches a point of no return.	6.168078047703237
547. indeed it is probable that this point	is reached the moment the third level of change begins.	4.794145207271667
548. at that point	we reach the closed historical situation: the situation in	which man is no longer free to return to a status quo ante.	6.324592159409745
549. at that	point men become aware of the mystery of history called variously fate	or destiny or providence and feel themselves	caught helplessly in the writhing of a disrupted society.	4.26358825664759
550. the reasons	for this experience are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of	such a change.	5.366195161938785
551. of all forms of being society or community	has the greatest element of determinability.	5.236151102699976
552. its ontological status is	itself most tenuous because apart from individual men who are its matter	tradition the form of society exists only as a shared	perception of truth.	5.974091461265218
553. the ontological status of society thus is constituted	by the psychological-intellectual-volitional status of society's	members.	3.93777821379478
554. the content of that psychological status determines	ultimately the content of civilization.	6.286985459309962
555. those social civilizational	factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group ultimately cease	to exist.	5.505761957201393
556. civilization itself- tradition- falls out of existence	when the human spirit itself becomes confused.	5.7836982265615156
557. civilization is what	man has made of himself.	5.3285636594893
558. its massive contours are rooted in the simple	need of man since he is always incomplete to complete himself.	5.740304293160128
559. it is not enough for man to be an ontological esse.	6.794061790742046
560. he needs existential	completion he needs that is to move in the direction of completion.	7.1096309603247505
561. and the direction of that movement is determined by his perception	of the truth about himself.	5.117618747847185
562. he must consequently exist as a	self-perceived substantive developing agent or he does not exist as	man.	7.440527353375066
563. thus it is no mystical intuition but an analyzable conception	to say that man and his tradition can fall out of existence.	4.340248988527027
564. this	happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance	in himself of a nature that in maritain's words is perceived as	a locus of intelligible necessities.	5.25558722521868
565. an existentialist is a man	who perceives himself only as esse as existence without substance.	4.466845978350164
566. thus human perception and human volition is the immanent	cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches	the civilizational level.	5.299620380403096
567. thus with regard to the loss of tradition	in the change from order to disorder the metaphysics of change works	itself out as a disruption of the individual soul a change in which man	continues as an objective ontological existent but no longer as a	man.	4.183332145108756
568. further change is a form of motion it occurs as the act	of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached	the terminus of the change.	5.917300152150241
569. with regard to the change we are examining	the question is at what point does the change become irreversible?	4.750881147551966
570. 	a number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in	the process.	6.093123995732186
571. change involves the displacement of form.	6.315558421768847
572. this means that	the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive	to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring	the existent form in being.	5.210873769725668
573. if the existent form is to be retained new	factors that reinforce it must be introduced into the situation.	5.229890370896008
574. in	the case of social decay form is displaced simply by the process of	dissolution with no form at the terminus of the process.	5.3231915568540105
575. now in the	mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have prima-facie evidence	of the ontological weakness of the fading form.	4.80060074510528
576. and when we consider	the tenuous hold tradition has on existence any weakening of that	hold constitutes a crisis of existence.	6.008924650973398
577. the retention of a tradition	confronted with such a crisis necessitates the introduction of new	spiritual forces into the situation.	3.929403242715979
578. however the crisis occurs precisely	as a weakening of spiritual forces.	7.491293877062617
579. it would seem therefore that	in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself.	5.59786339536187
580. the emergence	of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory	of disorder.	5.713334351000642
581. and it would seem that history is a witness to this	truth.	5.784197047028139
582. as a further characterization of the liberal conservative	split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for	escaping inevitabilities in history.	5.982470506725381
583. these differences in turn derive	from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character	of change.	4.411633295274241
584. anxiety and deep insecurity	are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition.	5.7836982265615156
585. to experience them it is not necessary for a people to be actively	aware of what is happening to it.	5.335027915560294
586. the process of erosion need only	undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding	within the individual while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation	of processes occurs.	5.443420876745886
587. within the individual the reaction has been	called various names all however pointing to the same basic experience.	4.871787224202066
588. weil identifies it as being rootless guardini as being	placeless riesman as being lonely.	5.7836982265615156
589. others call it alienation	and mean by that no simple economic experience	but a deep spiritual sense of dislocation.	4.321626463250261
590. within institutions	there is a marked decline of the process of persuasion and the substitution	of a force-fear process which masquerades as the earlier one	of persuasion.	5.864267734468828
591. we note the use of rhetoric as a weapon the manipulation	of the masses by propaganda the mobilization of effort and	resources.	4.565549884868785
592. within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed	responses to the experience of civilizational crisis two basic organizations	of response are observable: reaction and ideological progressivism.	5.900499988092923
593. these responses are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent	in the crisis.	5.587050334160066
594. both are predictably destined to fail.	9.543373652638747
595. the	response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing.	4.52012790592672
596. its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through	the repression of disruptive forces.	5.941747700518562
597. to this end political authority	is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers.	4.862266268150484
598. the implicit	assumption of this response is that history is reversible.	5.643027344585572
599. seemingly	order is perceived as a kind of subsistent entity now covered by	adventitious accretions.	5.023380279278678
600. the problem is to remove the accretions and	thereby uncover the order that was always there.	6.229412071837298
601. such a response of	course misses the point that in crisis order is going out of existence.	4.812413651533481
602. moreover its posture of stubborn but simple resistance is doomed	to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the existent form of	order once the activation of change has reached visible proportions.	5.389372437537448
603. the most reaction can achieve is stasis and a stasis that can be maintained	only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts	itself.	4.074003384208211
604. despite the hopelessness of the response it is explicable	in terms of the crisis of tradition itself.	7.056190272241734
605. since a civilizational	crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling	class reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves	to be among the ruling class.	4.181331977675531
606. their great error is to mingle the responses	typical of each of the three types of change.	6.745440451575591
607. since civilizational	change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze it seldom is	given adequate attention.	5.043151400155475
608. and the anxiety it generates is misinterpreted	as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status.	6.213271163606078
609. the basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its	realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational.	4.794750011790866
610. but this truth is distorted by its extreme application: the assumption	of the separate existence of tradition.	6.285286965777641
611. the reactionary misses	the point that tradition exists ontologically only in the form of	psychological-intellectual	relations.	5.060157263899384
612. reactionary theories for this reason	usually assume some form of organismic theory.	6.711551604951044
613. in its defensive	formulations the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of	the independent existence of the community.	4.596529308943678
614. in its dynamic form it	visualizes the community as the embodiment of an ontological force-	the race for instance which unfolds in history.	5.590901441434432
615. in both cases the	individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality.	5.4666569615862475
616. when the reactionary response is thus bolstered by an intellectual	defense the characteristics of that defense are explicable only	in terms of the basic attitudes of unanalyzed reaction.	5.750332718831702
617. reaction is	rooted in a perception of tradition as a whole.	4.681571082223364
618. it is a total situation	that is defended: the good old days.	7.387880346600035
619. there is no selectivity;	even the questionable features of the past are defended.	6.526923577212336
620. the point	is that the reactionary for whatever motive perceives himself to	have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself	something which consequently he was not able to accept or reject	on the basis of subjective preference.	4.930553242817258
621. the reactionary is confused about	the existential status of a decaying tradition but he does perceive	the unity tradition had when it was healthy.	3.8008304176543137
622. all of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic	insight in a literary work.	8.124126477757036
623. is the oedipus complex the clinical	syndrome material for a tragedy?	5.728453863554091
624.  if we remove ourselves for a moment	from our time and our infatuation with mental disease isn't there	something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his infantile	neurosis?	5.134217080245011
625.  i am not making a clinical judgment here for such	personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst's	consulting room but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies	than tragedy in life.	3.8130211968021737
626. a man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood	and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat	his earliest failure in love only makes us a little weary of man;	his tragedy seems unworthy and trivial.	4.917553402299183
627. now we can argue that	the irresistible fate of oedipus rex was nothing more than the irresistible	unconscious longings of oedipus projected outward but this	externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between	a story and a clinical case history.	4.034381371059583
628. we can also argue that the	three brothers karamazov and smerdyakov were the external representatives	of an internal conflict within one man dostoevsky a conflict	having to	do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father's woman.	4.9768508573249095
629. but	a novel in which one man karamazov explored the divisions within	his personality would scarcely merit publication in the psychoanalytic	quarterly.	4.118041848849638
630. it is a mistake to look upon the oedipus of	oedipus complex as a literary descendant of oedipus rex.	6.119031084294002
631. whatever	the psychological truth in the oedipus myth an oedipus who is drawn	to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of	humanity and its archaic crime and the incest that is unknowing renews	the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the	secret.	3.365448814554807
632. but a modern oedipus who is doomed because he cannot oppose	his own childhood is only pathetic and for renouncing the mystery	in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our sympathies.	4.981696067893309
633. i am suggesting that a case-history approach to the oedipus	complex is a blind alley for a storyteller.	4.845940847723387
634. the best gifts of the novelist	will be wasted on the reader who is insulated against any surprises	the novelist may have in store for him.	5.101031029827239
635. incest is still a durable	theme but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways	to surprise the emotions and there is no better way to do this than	that of concealment and symbolic representation.	4.893481881152941
636. and the best way to	conceal and disguise the elements of an incest story is not to set out	to write an incest story.	6.516169878767119
637. which brings to mind another lawrence story	and some interesting comparisons in the treatment of the oedipal	theme.	4.888770173751889
638. the rocking horse winner is also a story about	a boy's love for his mother.	5.647126556024358
639. if i now risk some comparisons with	sons and lovers let it be clear that i am not comparing the two	works or judging their merits; i am only singling out differences	in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects.	3.9256007807148294
640. the rocking horse	winner is a fantasy with extraordinary power to disturb the	reader- but we do not know why.	5.667750778818077
641. it is the story of the hopeless love	of a little boy for his cold and vain mother.	5.178583516631091
642. there are ghostly scenes	in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the	climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse.	5.569580182119012
643. the	child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his uncle to make	secret gifts of his money to his mother.	3.841511969386553
644. the story ends in the child's	illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to	ride his horse to win for his mother.	5.3365206370477365
645. the child dies with his mourning	mother at his bedside.	4.687736147225874
646. i had read the story many times without	asking myself why it affected me or caring why it did.	5.909999475302098
647. but on one	occasion when i encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was	my patient i began to understand the uncanny effects of this story.	4.067390480577937
648. it was of course a little boy's fantasy of winning his mother to	himself and replacing the father who could not give her the things she	wanted- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like- but if it were	only this the story would be banal.	5.1775528517662694
649. why does the story affect us?	6.902076960094791
650.  how	does the rocking exert its uncanny effect upon the reader?	6.53689853926529
651.  the	rocking is actually felt in the story a terrible and ominous rhythm that	prophesies the tragedy.	4.3862088763117875
652. the rocking i realized is the single element	in the story that carries the erotic message the unspoken and	unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a child's fantasy	and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit.	5.019836323711328
653. the	rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the erotic undercurrent	silent and making it present; it conceals and yet is suggestive;	a perfect symbol.	3.9235927278058758
654. and if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol	we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of impending tragedy.	6.089412067286183
655. for this love of the boy for his mother is a hopeless and forbidden	love doomed by its nature.	4.405590854190543
656. we are also struck by the fact	that this story of a boy's love for his mother does not offend while	the incestuous love of the man paul morel sometimes repels.	5.535386244083807
657. it's	easy to see why.	6.683325264329536
658. this love belongs to childhood; we accord it	its place there and in lawrence's treatment we are given the innocent	fantasy of a child in fact the form in which oedipal love is expressed	in childhood.	5.1049204886359645
659. and when the child dies in lawrence's story	in a delirium that is somehow brought on by his mania to win and to make	his mother rich the manifest absurdity of such a disease and such	a death does not enter into our thoughts at all.	3.925814648810016
660. we have so completely	entered the child's fantasy that his illness and his death are the	plausible and the necessary conclusion.	5.9804141927081425
661. i am sure that none	of the effects of this story were consciously employed by lawrence to	describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood.	4.698601602630068
662. it is most probable that	freud and the oedipus complex never entered his head in the writing	of this story.	5.964248697388575
663. he was simply writing a story that wanted to be told	and in the writing a childhood fantasy of his own emerged.	4.763526575832183
664. he would not	have cared why it emerged he only wanted to capture a memory to play	with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the	story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy.	4.832022106675515
665. in	our own time we have seen that the novelist's debt to psychoanalysis	has increased but that the novel itself has not profited much from	this marriage.	4.1470158989693005
666. ortega's hope that modern psychology might yet bring	forth a last flowering of the novel has only been partially fulfilled.	5.259987859570164
667. the young writer seems intimidated by psychological knowledge; he	has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological	insights.	4.957120048503832
668. he borrows the insights of psychology to improve	his impaired vision but cannot bring to his work the distinctive vision	that should be a novelist's own.	5.444110644461038
669. he has been seduced by the marvels	of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces	of character.	4.831142905687502
670. if many of the characters in contemporary novels appear	to be the bloodless relations of characters in a case history it is	because the novelist is often forgetful today that those things that	we call character manifest themselves in surface behavior that the ego	is still the executive agency of personality and that all we know of	personality must be discerned through the ego.	4.7198277652235054
671. the novelist who has	been badly baptized in psychoanalysis often gives us the impression that	since all men must have an oedipus complex all men must have the	same faces.	3.4918027873177544
672. i have argued that oedipus of the oedipus	complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature.	5.902310855349126
673. but a	writer who has a taste for irony and who sees incest in all its modern	dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing joke in the	incest myth the joke that strikes right at the center of man's humanness.	4.201693060992019
674. moral dread is seen as the other face of desire and here psychoanalysis	delivers to the writer a magnificent irony and a moral problem	of great complexity.	4.919953094486945
675. there is probably some significance	in the fact that two of the best incest stories i have encountered	in recent years are burlesques of the incest myth.	5.1049783386472
676. the ancient types	are reassembled in gloom and foreboding to be irresistibly drawn to their	destinies but the myth fails before the modern truth; the oracle	speaks false and the dream speaks true.	4.668006763047354
677. in both the farmer's tale	in ralph ellison's invisible man and in thomas mann's the	holy sinner the incest hero rises above the myth by accepting	the wish as motive; the heroic act is the casting off of pretense.	3.687681650763087
678. thomas mann wrote the holy sinner in 1951.	7.192756325807262
679. it was conceived	as a leave-taking a kind of melancholy gathering-in of the myths	of the west bevor die nacht sinkt eine lange nacht vielleicht	und ein tiefes vergessen.	4.120001989639191
680. he chose a medieval legend of	incest gregorius vom stein and freely borrowed and parodied other	myths of the west mixing themes language peoples and times in a master	myth in which the old forms continually renew themselves as in his	previous treatment of joseph.	5.051326848766227
681. but the holy sinner is	not simply a retelling of old stories for an old man's entertainment.	4.5240804713871725
682. mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center	of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as	the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated	joke he liked to tell.	4.911567885292779
683. and when he retold the legend of gregorius	he interpolated a modern version in which the medieval players speak	contemporary thoughts in archaic language; while they move through	the pageantry of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through	not-knowing they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other	and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the	twentieth-century manner.	3.632052352745411
684. grigorss is the child of an incestuous	union between a royal brother and sister the twins sibylla and	wiligis.	5.598594048870746
685. he is born in secrecy after the death of his father and cast	adrift soon after birth.	5.477620789442428
686. the infant is discovered by a fisherman who	brings him home to rear him.	5.289832921804139
687. an ivory tablet in the infant's cask	recounts the story of his sinful origins and is preserved for the child	by the monks of a monastery in the fishing village.	3.991701350065349
688. grigorss at	seventeen learns his story and goes forth as a knight to uncover his	origins.	5.762045355417663
689. his sailing vessel is guided by fate to the shores of his own	country at a time when sibylla's domain is overrun by the armies	of one of her rejected suitors.	4.09154634766224
690. grigorss overcomes the suitor in battle	delivers the city from its oppressors and marries sibylla who had	fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him.	4.89531030083855
691. sibylla is pregnant with their second child when she finds the ivory	tablet concealed by her husband and the identities of mother and son	are revealed.	3.8976215830956664
692. grigorss goes off to do penance on a rock for seventeen	years.	6.093123995732186
693. at the end of this period two pious christians in rome receive	the revelation which leads them to seek the next pope on the rock.	4.495961999485463
694. grigorss comes to rome and becomes a great and beloved pope.	6.093123995732186
695. in	the last pages of the book sibylla comes to rome to seek an audience	with the great pope and to give her confession.	4.322040792908902
696. mother and son recognize	each other and in mann's version of this legend make a remarkable	confession of guilt to each other the confession of unconscious	motive and unconscious knowledge of their true identities from the	time they had first set eyes on each other.	4.7076844218482155
697. in recollection he has said: natural or man-made objects kept coming	into my head but i would suppress them sternly.	4.204840025513765
698. moreover	he organized the movement of his forms within his rigorously shaped space	into highly complex equilibriums; and used gradations of color	value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors.	5.374258651899197
699. the worthy	mondrian seeing these pictures said in a tone of kindly reproof:	but you are really an artist of the naturalistic tradition!	helion did not realize it at the time but it was true.	4.116838184930486
700. his	monumental abstraction made up of smooth metallic non-objects	acting upon each other with great tension won helion much	acclaim during the 'thirties.	5.530303556928633
701. the play of novel lighting effects also	entered into these compositions whose controlled power and varied	activity made them well worth meditating.	3.605962185644203
702. as helion's work	showed more and more nostalgia for the world of man and nature the pure	abstractionists expressed some disapproval; but leger arp lipchitz	and alexander calder at the time gave him their blessing.	5.9581966810022235
703. his	canvases nowadays bore titles frankly declaring them to be figures	in space or blue figure or pink figure; and	they had heads and feet.	3.843981842855102
704. exhibited in shows in london in	1935 and in new york the following year the new more elaborated	abstracts were much favored in the circles of the modernists as three-dimentional	dramas of great intellectual coherence.	5.0939235011147685
705. at this period	the thirty-year old helion was ranked as one of the mature leaders	of the modern movement according to herbert read and in the	direct line of descent from cezanne seurat gris and leger.	4.162995474249385
706. in	america meyer schapiro observed that unlike the mondrian school	helion sought a return path to the fullness of nature within the	framework of abstract art.	5.004173005508399
707. it is notable that at this time	he was writing with admiration of cimabue's and poussin's way	of filling space.	4.1564372158642655
708. abstract art was still the right path for him; but	he	held instead of continuing as an art of reduction it must grow	must make a place for the contributions of the raphaels and poussins	as well as for those of the early cubists and mondrian.	5.341571885534955
709. later	helion wrote of this phase: for years i built for myself	a subtle instrument of relationships- colors and forms without a name.	3.8659789941192084
710. i played on it my secret songs unexplained passionate and peaceful.	6.535629654039423
711. but his own work was evolving further.	6.467548231715819
712. the extreme limitations	he sensed in all current abstract art made that seem to him increasingly	arid and cold.	5.13675376062788
713. he was engaged in constant experiments that	searched for new directions.	5.519824192300624
714. where would it all lead?	9.971831355879885
715.  he himself	did not know as he said in 1935.	5.252864107177152
716. but he was afraid of the future-	he would in fact welcome a way back to social integration a functional	art of some kind.	5.786527179210385
717. during the 1920's the abstractionists	the german bauhaus group of industrial designers and the new	architects all had the dream of some well ordered utopia or welfare	state in which their neat and logical constructions might find their	proper place.	3.637157950496672
718. but whereas the postwar american abstractionists seem	to helion to be determined to escape from the real world or simply	to rebel against it the ordered abstractions which he and his	associates of the 1930's were painting embodied the hope of improving	things.	5.076215633264173
719. we were possessed by visions of a new civilization	to come very pure and elevated he has said in fact some ideal	form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of 1914-1918.	4.200057667552675
720. instead of this the 1930's witnessed a tragic economic	depression the rise of fascist dictators in europe the wasting	civil war in spain.	5.601866450089384
721. very much the political man helion felt himself	deeply affected by the increasingly pessimistic atmosphere of france	and all europe whose foundations seemed to him more and more shaky.	4.237292943425052
722. in 1936 he decided to migrate to america.	7.712287370161345
723. the rooseveltian america	was a haven of liberalism and progress and seemed to him to constitute	the last best hope for civilization.	3.745215610467047
724. helion also hoped that	america's mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be	accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works.	5.389116624094432
725. i arrived	in the united states with the idea of establishing myself there	more or less permanently and finding inspiration for new compositions.	5.039760471882651
726. in new york he was well received by what was then only	a small brave band of non-figurative artists including alexander calder	george k l morris de kooning holty and a few others.	5.644354892952186
727. after a year in a studio on sheridan square having married an	american girl who was a native of virginia helion moved to a village	in the blue ridge mountains where he produced some of the most	imposing of his abstract canvases.	4.146827829732849
728. the darkening world scene	at the time of the munich pact continued to trouble his mind even in	his remote virginia studio.	5.466256772127599
729. fear possessed me and the certainty	of war he has related.	5.017428852854806
730. i truly smelled blood death heaps of	corpses everywhere.	7.430146395037167
731. in haste he labored to finish some last abstract	paintings: a three-panel frieze with a flying figure and a fallen	figure; a double-figure which went to the chicago art	institute and is considered by him the most successful of his abstracts;	and in early 1939 a fallen figure of very ominous character	which concluded his abstract phase.	3.581360449425205
732. i knew i was carrying	on with abstraction to its very end- for me he said of the two	years' output in virginia.	5.747137976622466
733. with those paintings of big constructions	crashing down he felt he could stop.	4.867013367825509
734. they were in effect his last	testament to non-objective art.	8.217429565858046
735. he had taken out first papers	for american citizenship; but after war came to europe he decided	to return to france arriving there in january 1940.	4.047101943663938
736. i hated	the war he said but thought i ought to go because i was perhaps	one of those who hadn't done enough to prevent it.	5.948879804651741
737. in june 1940 sergeant helion with a company of reserve troops waiting	to go into battle was sketching the hills south of the loire	river when the war suddenly rolled in upon him.	3.8681699742442666
738. its first apparition	was a long gloomy column of refugees riding in farm wagons or pushing	prams.	5.938773946509162
739. his company then carried out a confused retreating movement	until it was surrounded by the germans a few days before france capitulated.	4.3089696759914435
740. after a sort of death march during four days without food	helion and his comrades were shipped by cattle-car to a labor camp	at an estate farm in east germany.	5.535428537004741
741. a year later they were removed to	a stalag in the harbor of stettin.	5.212699550125515
742. at the time of his capture helion	had on his person a sketchbook he had bought at woolworth's in	new york.	6.724268031990166
743. when he was stripped deloused and numbered by his guards	his much-thumbed sketchbook was seized and thrown on a pile of prisoners'	goods to be confiscated.	4.256585952623009
744. it was then i knew that they were	making war against man the individual within!- who questioned	things when given orders.	5.811224889190829
745. at stettin the university-educated	artist who had studied german was chosen to serve as interpreter	and clerk in the office of the stalag commander.	4.689755125798008
746. in secret he also	acted as a member of the prisoners' central committee which plotted	sabotage planned a few escapes and maintained a hidden control over	the wretched french slave-laborers.	5.450827362084791
747. in the stalag helion	came to know and love his comrades most of them plain folk who in	their extremity showed true courage and ran great risks to help each	other.	3.9984520866983906
748. how much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground	committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped	to escape.	7.103667553793056
749. in the prison camp's black market civilian clothes were	quietly bought and forged papers were devised for him; during long	weeks the plan for his flight was rehearsed.	3.7769624810712785
750. every morning	contingents of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories.	6.412233393147007
751. one evening while a volley-ball game was being played in the yard	among the prisoners remaining there a simulated melee was staged-	just as the gates were opened to admit other prisoners returning from	work.	3.6384863896270114
752. as helion wrote afterward:   their sentry followed	h four hands were stretched toward me by my comrades behind me.	5.629030617195874
753. marquet	held my briefcase; finot held a wallet with my money and papers;	moineau and david held nothing but their fingers h they felt	rough and kind and warm.	3.68775399310451
754. at this moment the volley-ball hit the ground.	9.215859424252136
755. duclos ran toward desprez with fists raised.	5.3285636594893
756. the guards all	rushed up to intervene h   shedding his prison cloak helion	shot through the gates now clad in civilian garments and with the	passport of a flemish worker.	4.616185526079841
757. riding trains hitching hikes on trucks	across germany slipping through guarded frontiers with the help of	secret guides he eventually reached vichy france and by the winter	of 1943 was back in virginia.	3.910450752820992
758. he wrote:   to escape from	a prison camp required a very special state of mind; not only loathing	of captivity but a faith a hope that is even stronger.	4.945258578377656
759. i left	behind me brave men whom captivity had robbed of all hope.	4.711609050204151
760. they too	loved their families longed for their villages: yet lacked the faith	that drove one to dare h the fearful chance of escape.	5.21437600263385
761. it was a time of revelations for him.	6.940746137246689
762. even the most rational of men	under great stress may be transported by a new faith and behave like	mystics.	6.778724118784346
763. helion knew that he owed his freedom as much to the self-sacrifice	of his fellow-men in arbeitskommando 13 stettin as to	his own fierce	will and love of life.	3.9701640087045353
764. after that he declared to return to	freedom was to fall to one's knees before the real world and adore	it.	5.697261940649579
765. in prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from	life his guards his companions in misery.	4.942602490347622
766. now all his desires centered	on rediscovering and singing of the prosaic and yet beautiful	world of men and objects so long barred from me by a barbed wire fence.	5.0361009067344416
767. and he added: during the many months in prison camp all	abstract images vanished from my mind.	4.593958408738386
768. before leaving for america	he happened to see his old friend jean arp and confided to	him his new resolutions.	5.868445069450208
769. arp protested: but it is impossible!	everything in the way of representation has already been done by the	old masters.	5.427741175541614
770. helion however clung to the belief that in escaping	from the stalag i had also escaped from abstraction.	6.075372978967674
771. while convalescing in his virginia home he wrote a book recording	his prison experiences and escape entitled: they shall not have	me h published originally in english by dutton	+ co of new york in 1943 the book was received by the press	as a work of astonishing literary power and one of the most realistic	accounts of world war 2 from the french side.	4.197069775308952
772. it was very widely	read too; and the author who seemed the embodiment of france's	rising spirit of resistance to her conquerors was much complimented	for his daring military action.	5.171125939702109
773. but when he showed his new figurative	pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp they paid him	no compliments and drew long faces.	4.128353550933639
774. between 1944 and 1947 helion	had a series of one-man shows- at the paul rosenberg gallery	in new york and in paris- of his new realistic pictures.	5.700192013610351
775. they reincarnated	the figures of human beings banished from his canvases since	the 1920's.	4.64497413390872
776. these new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace	objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking	about as the things they missed most hence associated with the sense	of lost freedom: the cafe at the corner the newspaper kiosk the girls	in doorways and windows along the street the golden-crusted french	bread they lacked the cigarettes denied them.	4.8745278742644125
777. one of the pictures	was of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously lighting a cigarette;	others were of men doffing their hats to each other carrying	umbrellas with pomp reading newspapers or simply showing loaves of	bread spread out.	4.094611158103707
778. important as was mr o'donnell's essay his thesis is	so restricting as to deny faulkner the stature which he obviously has.	5.160513208686437
779. he and also mr cowley and mr warren have fallen to the temptation	which besets many of us to read into our authors- nathaniel	hawthorne for example and herman melville- protests against	modernism material progress and science which are genuine protests of	our own but may not have been theirs.	3.7346196661235194
780. faulkner's total works today	and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when mr cowley	made his comment or in 1939 when mr o'donnell wrote his	essay reveal no such simple attitude toward the south.	4.890195702672801
781. if he is a	traditionalist he is an eclectic traditionalist.	7.104788659216417
782. if he condemns the	recent or the present he condemns the past with no less force.	6.457101418889612
783. if he	sees the heroic in a sartoris or a sutpen he sees also- and he	shows- the blind and the mean and he sees the compson family disintegrating	from within.	3.805623580307793
784. if the barn-burner's family produces a flem	snopes who personifies commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic	crassness the compson family produces a jason compson 4.	5.38709357028385
785. faulkner	is a most untraditional traditionalist.	6.094118058689911
786. others writing on	faulkner have found the phrase traditional moralist either inadequate	or misleading.	6.567459136747736
787. among them are frederick j hoffman william	van o'connor and mrs olga vickery.	5.222922855193622
788. they have indicated	the direction but they have not been explicit enough i believe in	pointing out faulkner's independence his questioning if not indeed	challenging the southern tradition.	5.987379323562388
789. faulkner's is not the mind	of the apologist which mr o'donnell implies that it is.	4.7637992704002
790. he is	not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body	of social cultural or literary traditions than he was within the traditions-	or possibly the regulations- governing his tenure in the	post office at oxford mississippi thirty-five years ago.	4.698867647091671
791. that	is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions of course that	he is steeped in them in fact or that he has dealt with them in	his books.	4.266773252953022
792. it is to say rather i believe that he has brought to bear	on the history the traditions and the lore of his region a critical	skeptical mind- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate	experimenter in literary form and technique.	5.688513414709643
793. he has employed from	his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed	southern.	4.571486595540816
794. the fact that he has cast over those materials the light	of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less southern i rather	think for the south has been no more solid than other regions except	in the political and related areas where patronage and force and	intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity.	5.228504457070233
795. some of us might	be inclined to argue in fact that an independence of mind and action	and an intolerance of regimentation either mental or physical	are particularly southern traits.	4.236375856262414
796. there is no necessity i suppose	to assert that mr faulkner is southern.	6.967200741494672
797. it would not be	easy to discover a more thoroughly southern pedigree than that of his	family.	5.622054423880937
798. and after all he has lived comfortably at both oxford mississippi	and charlottesville virginia.	6.808275006459121
799. the young william faulkner	in new orleans in the 1920's impressed the novelist hamilton	basso as obviously conscious of being a southerner and there is no	evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so.	3.7278326799562107
800. besides showing no inclination apparently to absent himself from his	native region even for short periods and in addition writing a shelf	of books set in the region he has handled in those books an astonishingly	complete list of matters which have been important in the south	during the past hundred years.	4.9271929436826865
801. it is more difficult with faulkner	than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is	the source of his knowledge.	4.743479648801278
802. his own testimony is that he has read very	little in the history of the south implying that what he knows of	that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around	him primarily from his own unassisted observation.	6.088958693697647
803. his denials of extensive	reading notwithstanding it is no doubt safe to assume that he	has spent time schooling himself in southern history and that he has	gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived	in the south or have written about the south.	3.8691678413082586
804. to believe otherwise	would be unrealistic.	9.234244616425169
805. but in looking at faulkner against	his background in mississippi and the south it is important not to	lose the broader perspective.	5.054854655799316
806. his earliest work reflected heavy influences	from english and continental writers.	6.523972367935294
807. evidence is plentiful that	early	and later also he has been indebted to the gothic romancers	who deal in extravagant horror to the symbolists writing at the end	of the preceding century and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness	novelists henry james and james joyce among them.	3.676427672509009
808. his repeated	experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence	of mind and an originality of approach but it also shows him	touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him.	5.014540996379669
809. my intention therefore is not to say that faulkner's awareness	has been confined within the borders of the south but rather that	he has looked at his world as a southerner and that presumably his outlook	is southern.	4.3009169270176
810. the ingredients of faulkner's novels and	stories are by no means new with him and most of the problems he takes	up have had the attention of authors before him.	6.123825915205746
811. a useful comment	on his relation to his region may be made i think by noting briefly	how in handling southern materials and southern problems he has deviated	from the pattern set by other southern authors while remaining	faithful to the essential character of the region.	3.535532447234592
812. the planter	aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since john pendleton	kennedy published swallow-barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait	of frank meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated	the most persistent tradition of southern literature.	4.6733591971611945
813. the thoroughgoing	idealization of the planter society did not come however	until after the civil war when southern writers were eager to defend	a way of life which had been destroyed.	4.256134624165982
814. as they looked with nostalgia	to a society which had been swept away they were probably no more	than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed.	5.492746640390136
815. their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the	south even while memories of the war were still sharp.	4.3714659090720165
816. the tradition	reached its apex perhaps in the works of thomas nelson page toward	the end of the century and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934	in the best-selling novel so red the rose by stark young.	5.728731858215901
817. although faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition	he did not have stark young's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize	the planter society.	4.486368970135511
818. the myth of the southern plantation	has had only a tangential relation with actuality as francis	pendleton gaines showed forty years ago and i suspect it has had a	far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed.	5.042349320216564
819. faulkner has found it useful but he has employed it with his	habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook.	4.520275660025826
820. without saying or	seeming to say that in portraying the sartoris and the compson families	faulkner's chief concern is social criticism we can say nevertheless	that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the	planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the civil	war.	4.926880133906352
821. it may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional	pattern more violently than in any other regard for the treatment	in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of ellen	glasgow who was the only important novelist before him to challenge	the conventional picture of planter society.	3.9429145122398452
822. faulkner's low-class	characters had but few counterparts in earlier southern novels	dealing with plantation life.	5.7836982265615156
823. they have an ancestry extending back	however at least to 1728 when william byrd described the lubberlanders	he encountered in the back country of virginia and north carolina.	4.476156112249227
824. the chief literary antecedents of the snopes clan appeared in the	realistic humorous writing which originated in the south and the	southwest in the three decades before the civil war.	5.162383741769536
825. these narratives	of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers	as a rule and later found their way between book covers though	rarely into the planters' libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes	of horace mr addison mr pope and sir walter scott.	3.494330945791169
826. there is evidence to suggest in fact that many authors of the humorous	sketches were prompted to write them- or to make them as indelicate	as they are- by way of protesting against the artificial refinements	which had come to dominate the polite letters of the south.	5.454113186213166
827. william	gilmore simms sturdy realist that he was pleaded for a natural	robustness such as he	found in his favorites the great elizabethans	to vivify the pale writings being produced around him.	3.8403365806594927
828. simms admired	the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods but he had himself social	affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully.	5.627363645091084
829. augustus	baldwin longstreet a preacher and a college and university president	in four southern states published the earliest of these backwoods	sketches and in the character ransy sniffle in the accounts of	sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat and in the shockingly	unliterary speech of his characters he set an example followed	by many after him.	3.6991191900627083
830. others who wrote of low characters and low	life included thomas bangs thorpe creator of the big bear of arkansas	and tom owen the bee-hunter; johnson jones hooper whose	character simon suggs bears a close kinship to flem snopes in	both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the	sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will; and george	washington harris whose tennessee hillbilly character sut lovingood	perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain	than any other character in literature.	4.558502894731379
831. it would be profitable i believe	to read these realistic humorists alongside faulkner's works	the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything	to them directly but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with	a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our	time to faulkner's time.	3.6147378858192885
832. such a comparison reminds us that in employing	low characters in his works faulkner is recording actuality	in the south and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent.	5.49858242711966
833. such characters with their low existence and often low morality	produce humorous effects in his novels and tales as they did in	the writing of longstreet and hooper and harris but it need not be	added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than	they had in the earlier writers; nor is there need to add that among	them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful	of his characters.	3.6919696782603144
834. one of the early humorists already mentioned	thomas bangs thorpe can be used to illustrate another point	where faulkner touches authentic southern materials and also earlier	literary treatment of those materials.	6.011159149450899
835. thorpe came to louisiana from	the east as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting	of romantic adventure and idealized beauty.	4.447516299211204
836. but thorpe saw also	the hardships of pioneer existence the cultural poverty of the frontier	settlements and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions.	5.549487341194333
837. as a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and	feelings he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips	and on the other an anecdote of the village of hardscrabble arkansas	where no one had ever seen a piano; and he wrote also the masterpiece	of frontier humor the big bear of arkansas in which	earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods	tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the	mysteries of nature.	3.5365402357619105
838. some years ago julian huxley proposed to an audience made	up of members of the british association for the advancement of	science that man's supernormal or extra-sensory faculties are now	in the same case as were his mathematical faculties during the ice	age.	5.383429981455962
839. as a humanist dr huxley interests himself in the possibilities	of human development and one thing we can say about this	suggestion which comes from a leading zoologist is that so far as he	is concerned the scientific outlook places no rigid limitation upon	the idea of future human evolution.	3.895269856083511
840. this text from dr huxley	is sometimes used by enthusiasts to indicate that they have the permission	of the scientists to press the case for a wonderful unfoldment	of psychic powers in human beings.	5.552373228851907
841. there may be a case of this sort	but it is not one we wish to argue here.	6.453452794600311
842. even if people do in a	not far distant future begin to read one another's minds there will	still be the question of whether what you find in another man's mind	is especially worth reading- worth more that is than what you can	read in good books.	5.032765990212251
843. even if men eventually find themselves able to	look through walls and around corners one may question whether this	will help them to live better lives.	4.073767690517174
844. there would be side-conclusions	to be drawn of course; such capacities are impressive evidence pointing	to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts	of biologists and organic evolutionists; but the basic puzzles	of existence would still be puzzling and we should still have to work	out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article.	5.149997954959237
845. all we want from dr huxley's statement is the feeling that this	is an open world in the view of the best scientific opinion with	practically no directional commitments as to what may happen next and	no important confinements with respect to what may be possible.	4.427764321171357
846. it seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human	beings arise from the fact that man is not one but many.	6.9799136403271085
847. each man	that is is both one and many.	5.665895349263116
848. he is a dreamer of the good society with	a plan to put into effect and he is an individual craftsman with	something to make for himself and the people of his time.	6.4113969601944385
849. he is a parent	with a child to nurture here and now and he is an educator who worries	about the children half way round the world.	4.564277861532892
850. he is a utopian with	a stake in tomorrow and he is a vulnerable human made captive by the	circumstances of today.	6.875087397433783
851. he can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and	he can sacrifice tomorrow for himself.	5.0233650351293475
852. he is a craig's wife who agonizes	about tobacco ash on the living room rug and he is a forgetful	genius who goes boating with the town baker when dignitaries from the	local university have come to call.	5.995566922951977
853. he is the stern guardian of the status	quo who has raised the utilitarian structures of the age and he	is the revolutionary poet with a gun in his hand who writes a tragic	apologetic to posterity for the men he has killed.	4.003119374959561
854. what will be	the final symmetry of the good society?	7.634987831467664
855.  for what do the utopians	labor?	6.835838655465237
856.  here on a desk is a stack of pamphlets representing the efforts	of some of the best men of the day to penetrate these questions.	7.190714449902739
857. the pamphlets are about law the corporation forms of government the	idea of freedom the defense of liberty the various lethargies which	overtake our major institutions the gap between traditional social	ideals and the working mechanisms that have been set in motion for their	realization.	3.4122162207201674
858. the thing that is notable in all these discussions is	the lack of ideological ardor.	6.115103624328115
859. there is another kind of ardor a quiet	sure devotion to the fundamental decencies of human life but no	angry utopian contentions.	4.334530359212692
860. actually you could wish for some passion	now and then but when you look around the world and see the little volcanos	of current history which partisan social passions have wrought	you are glad that in these pamphlets there is at least some civilized	calm.	5.645064239993484
861. you could also say that in these pamphlets is a relieving	quality of maturity.	5.031505071138466
862. there is essential pleasantness in reading the	writing of men who are not angry who can contend without quarreling.	7.041796463371123
863. this is the good kind of sophistication and with all our problems	and crises this kind of sophistication has flowered in the united states	during recent years.	4.75500161389675
864. a characteristic expression of such concern	and inquiry is found in joseph p lyford's introduction to the	agreeable autocracies a recent paperback study of the institutions	of modern democratic society.	5.443316955480385
865. mr lyford gives voice to a temper	that represents we think an achieved plateau of reflective thinking.	4.27311739284845
866. after casting about for a way of describing this spirit we decided	that it would be better to use mr lyford's introduction as	an illustration.	6.373989723695949
867. he begins:   at one time it seemed as if	the soviet union had done us a favor by providing a striking example	of how not to behave towards other peoples and other nations.	3.900286881732025
868. as	things turned out however we have not profited greatly from the lesson:	instead of persistently following a national program of our own	we have often been satisfied to be against whatever soviet policy seemed	to be at the moment.	4.969282399751028
869. such activity may or may not have irritated	the kremlin but it has frequently condemned america to an unnatural	defensiveness that has undermined our effort to give leadership to the	free world.	4.372043604354815
870. the defensiveness has been exaggerated by another	bad habit our tendency to rate the goodness or badness	of other nations by the extent to which they applaud the slogans we circulate	about ourselves.	4.964428860034554
871. since the slogans have little application to	reality and are sanctimonious to boot the applause is faint even in areas	of the world where we should expect to find the greatest affection	for free government.	3.951335002591577
872. shocked at the response to our proclamations	we grow more defensive and worse we lose our sense of humor and proportion.	5.7045315811366555
873. mr nehru is subjected to stern lectures on neutralism by	our department of state and an american president observes sourly	that sweden would be a little less neurotic if it were a little more	capitalistic.	4.395599713896642
874. one thing you can say about mr lyford is	that he does not suffer from any insecurity as an american.	6.56996857529704
875. those	who are insecure fear to be candid in self-examination.	5.241960549161479
876. only the strong	look squarely at weakness.	9.913542981627653
877. the maturity in this point of view lies	in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being	clearly understood.	3.8808955415776434
878. mr lyford continues:   even if the	self portrait we distribute for popular consumption were accurate it	would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society.	5.687971836360343
879. we	would be ignoring the special circumstances of other countries.	4.855658467968249
880. the	picture is the more treacherous when it misrepresents the facts of american	life.	6.569632698254213
881. the discrepancy between what we commonly profess and what	we practice or tolerate is great and it does not escape the notice	of others.	3.9245145019570478
882. if our sincerity is granted and it is granted the discrepancy	can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe	hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding	gained by earnest self-examination.	6.3916087643293045
883. what is more the legends have become	so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination or self-criticism	smells of low treason and men who practice it are defeatists and	unpatriotic scoundrels.	4.143547260623198
884. h although we continue to pay our	conversational devotions to free private enterprise individual	initiative the democratic way government of the people	competition of the marketplace etc we live rather comfortably	in a society in which economic competition is diminishing in	large areas bureaucracy is corroding representative government technology	is weakening the citizen's confidence in his own power to make	decisions and the threat of war is driving him economically and physically	into the ground.	4.779249950147965
885. the interesting thing about mr	lyford's approach and the approach of the contributors to the	agreeable autocracies to the situation	of american civilization is that it is concerned with comprehending	the psychological relationships which are having a decisive effect	on american life.	3.913144099276474
886. in an ideological argument the participants tend	to thump the table.	7.32172514412802
887. they are determined to prove something.	8.066614403660406
888. the	new spirit so well illustrated by mr lyford's work is wholly	free of this anxiety.	5.696609310373115
889. the problem is rather to find out what is actually	happening and this is especially difficult for the reason that we	are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present sometimes	by the very agencies- our educational system our mass media our	statesmen- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding	of ourselves.	4.4489472225586
890. the introduction continues:   we experience	a vague uneasiness about events a suspicion that our political	and economic institutions like the genie in the bottle have escaped	confinement and that we have lost the power to recall them.	4.93345594564445
891. we feel	uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television	set but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and	what they are doing to us we can hardly learn to control them.	3.702766146696861
892. it does	not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles	on the national purpose.	6.689545563321721
893. the agreeable autocracies	is an attempt to explore some of the institutions which both reflect	and determine the character of the free society today.	4.5546435298358725
894. the men who	speculate on these institutions have for the most part come to at least	one common conclusion: that many of the great enterprises and associations	around which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic	in nature and possessed of power which can be used to frustrate	the citizen who is trying to assert his individuality in the modern	world.	5.634816849062416
895. these institutions which mr lyford names agreeable	autocracies- where did they come from?	4.646674038929972
896.  of one thing we	can be sure: they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists	of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles	and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the free	society.	5.34876424471187
897. no doubt there are historians who can explain to a	great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth	century.	4.412259048863702
898. going back over this ground and analyzing the composition	of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken	by the center for the study of democratic institutions in	santa barbara.	5.671235165350873
899. but however we come finally to explain and account	for the present the truth we are trying to expose right now is that	the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find	it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host	of all their enterprises.	3.501134180179812
900. the host is the flowing life of the human race.	7.680273889723982
901. this life has its own currents and rhythms its own multiple cycles	and adaptations.	4.521133905130328
902. on occasion it produces extraordinary novelties.	9.139526785150355
903. should rousseau have been able to leave room in his social theory	for the advent of television atomic energy and ibm machines?	4.395976056424196
904. 	how would thomas jefferson feel after reading factories in the	field?	6.289010577019261
905.  they tell us sir that we are free because we have in one	hand a ballot and in the other a stock certificate.	5.576719687739109
906. with these we	shape our destiny and own private property and that sir makes ours	the best of all possible societies.	6.043829423556071
907. the reality of the situation however	is described by mr lyford:   many of us may even	be secretly relieved at having a plausible excuse to delegate ancient	civic responsibilities to a new bureaucracy of experts.	4.031385639626237
908. thus the member	of an industrial union comes to regard his officers as business	agents who may proceed without interference or recall; the stockholder	delivers his proxy; and the citizen narrows his political participation	to the mere act of voting- if he votes at all.	4.785050897500884
909. copernicus did not question it ptolemy could not.	5.066959048406199
910. given the conceptual	context within which ancient thought thrived how could anyone have	questioned this principle?	5.981496131889986
911.  the reasons for this are partly observational	partly philosophical and reinforced by other aesthetic and	cultural factors.	4.260087042311285
912. the obvious	natural fact to ancient thinkers was the diurnal rotation of the	heavens.	5.390500575037483
913. not only did constellations like draco cepheus and cassiopeia	spin circles around the pole but stars which were not circumpolar	rose and set at the same place on the horizon each night.	4.219059554561502
914. nor did	a constellation's stars vary in brightness during the course of their	nocturnal flights.	7.225383228775741
915. the conclusion- the distances of the constellations	did not vary and their paths were circular.	3.872342767520762
916. moreover the sun's	path over earth described a segment of a great circle; this was	clear from the contour of the shadow traced by a gnomon before and after	noon.	5.419601121845938
917. as early as the 6th century bc the earth	was seen to be spherical.	5.299021402657277
918. ships disappear hull-first over the horizon;	approaching shore their masts appeared first.	6.093123995732186
919. earth being at	the center of the universe would have the same shape as the latter;	so eg did aristotle argue although this may not be an observational	reason in favor of circularity.	5.121987934674431
920. the discoid shapes of	sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of celestial things.	5.769626297214899
921. in light of all this one would require special reasons for	saying that the paths of the heavenly bodies were other than circular.	4.112660136259363
922. why for example should the ancients have supposed the diurnal rotation	of the heavens to be elliptical?	6.195051609210132
923.  or oviform?	11.496738681532504
924.  or angular?	15.444198090664539
925. 	there were no reasons for such suppositions then.	5.066959048406199
926. this conjoined	with the considerations above made the circular motions of heavenly	bodies appear an almost directly observed fact.	5.45818851704242
927. additional philosophical	considerations advanced notably by aristotle supported further	the circularity principle.	4.9042855812487955
928. by distinguishing superlunary	and sublunary existence and reinforcing this with	the four-element physics of empedocles aristotle came to speak of	the stars as perfect bodies which moved in only a perfect way viz	in a perfect circle.	4.920976678115593
929. now what is perfect motion?	7.146806727942392
930.  it must	apparently be motion without termini.	8.910414979842207
931. because motion which begins and	ends at discrete places would be incomplete.	5.260309292903104
932. circular motion however since it is eternal and perfectly continuous	lacks termini.	6.764408985106059
933. it is never motion towards something.	6.638508225341052
934. only imcomplete	imperfect things move towards what they lack.	7.887076528025433
935. perfect complete	entities if they move at all do not move towards what they lack.	4.453324428454441
936. they move only in accordance with what is in their natures.	8.548947920793612
937. thus circular	motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely	perfect celestial existence.	5.593412337780835
938. to return now to the four-element	physics a mixture of muddy frothy water will when standing in	a jar separate out with earth at the bottom water on top and the	air on top of that.	5.5036417240789195
939. a candle alight in the air directs its flame and	smoke upwards.	5.1290551501771535
940. this gives a clue to the cosmical order of elements.	7.989676612005167
941. thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe.	6.5610042976687755
942. it is covered	with water air is atop of that.	7.142474654729522
943. pure fire is in	the heavens.	6.094118058689911
944. when combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms	of this universe are best appreciated when least embodied in a material	substratum it becomes clear that while earth will be dross on a	scale of material-formal ratios celestial bodies will be of a subtle	quickened ethereal existence in whose embodiment pure form will be	the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary.	4.636844622962273
945. the stars constitute an order of existence different from what	we encounter on earth.	4.01320189254933
946. this is clear when one distinguishes the types	of motion appropriate to both regions.	6.592151976095505
947. a projectile shot up from earth	returns rectlinearly to its 'natural' place of rest.	4.2705665792608904
948. but the	natural condition for the heavenly bodies is neither rest nor rectilinear	motion.	6.512782700697277
949. being less encumbered by material embodiments they partake	more of what is divine.	5.3393407420809424
950. their motion will be eternal and perfect.	7.89213993478442
951. let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between ptolemaic	and copernican astronomy.	5.475743997089916
952. bluntly there never was a ptolemaic system	of astronomy.	6.806723317680827
953. copernicus' achievement was to have invented	systematic astronomy.	5.936819829599329
954. the almagest and the hypotheses outline	ptolemy's conception of his own task as the provision of computational	tables independent calculating devices for the prediction	of future planetary perturbations.	5.016142848058539
955. indeed in the halma edition of theon's	presentation of the hypotheses there is a chart setting	out otherwise unrelated diagrams for describing	the planetary motions.	4.490365083898234
956. no attempt is made by ptolemy to weld	into a single scheme these independent predicting-machines.	6.294126765188816
957. they all have this in common: the earth is situated	near the center of the deferent.	5.153607870141916
958. but that one should superimpose all	these charts run a pin through the common point and then scale each	planetary deferent larger and smaller	this is contrary to any intention ptolemy ever expresses.	5.095720074203199
959. he might even suppose the planets to move at infinity.	5.208546087917959
960. ptolemy's	problem is to forecast where against the inverted bowl of night some	particular light will be found at future times.	5.270099936804924
961. his problem concerns	longitudes latitudes and angular velocities.	5.5832160523981065
962. the distances of these	points of light is a problem he cannot master beyond crude conjectures	as to the orderings of the planetary orbits viewed outward from earth.	4.846688938190442
963. but none of this has prevented scientists philosophers and even	historians of science from speaking of the ptolemaic system in	contrast to the copernican.	4.164298098226912
964. it is engendered by	confounding the aristotelian cosmology in the almagest with the	geocentric astronomy.	6.199299039213265
965. ptolemy recurrently denies that he could	ever explain planetary motion.	4.855658467968249
966. this is what necessitates the nonsystematic	character of his astronomy.	8.448645893571287
967. so when textbooks like that	of baker set out drawings of the 'ptolemaic system' complete	with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged	on their several deferents we have nothing but a misleading 20th-century	idea of what never existed historically.	3.7976295671652713
968. it is	the chief merit in copernicus' work that all his planetary calculations	are interdependent.	6.529512050809067
969. he cannot eg compute the retrograde	arc traveled by mars without also making suppositions about the	earth's own motion.	4.26819919707757
970. he cannot describe eclipses without entertaining	some form of	a three-body problem.	6.941114833316636
971. in ptolemaic terms however eclipses	and retrograde motion were phenomena simpliciter to be explained	directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations.	4.002551856872899
972. in a	systematic astronomy like that of copernicus retrogradations become	part of the conceptual structure of the system; they are no longer	a puzzling aspect of intricately variable local planetary motions.	5.443235690493521
973. another contrast stressed when discussing ptolemaic vs	copernican astronomy turns on the idea of simplicity.	5.283555738921018
974. it is often	stated that copernican astronomy is 'simpler' than ptolemaic.	6.8419076308501925
975. some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of	the former.	6.925052054401465
976. thus margenau remarks: a large number of unrelated	epicycles was needed to explain the observations but otherwise the	ptolemaic system served well and with quantitative precision.	5.746727805424996
977. copernicus	by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe	was able to reduce the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen.	5.020017169651547
978. historical records indicate that copernicus was unaware of the	fundamental aspects of his so-called 'revolution' unaware perhaps	of its historical importance he rested content with having produced	a simpler scheme for prediction.	4.803644928780919
979. as an illustration of the principle	of simplicity the heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because	it allows simplicity to be arithmetized; it involves a reduction	in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen.	4.084916057147674
980. without careful qualification this can be misleading.	9.032482521971229
981. if in any one	calculation ptolemy had had to invoke 83 epicycles all at once	while copernicus never required more than one third this number then	ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler	than copernican.	4.001152359370664
982. but no single planetary problem ever required	of ptolemy more than six epicycles at one time.	6.10198581374308
983. this of course results	from the non-systematic 'cellular' character of ptolemaic	theory.	5.293298828795261
984. calculations within the copernican framework always raised questions	about planetary configurations.	6.289010577019261
985. these could be met only by considering	the dynamical elements of several planets at one time.	4.519824559694223
986. this	is more ambitious than ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces	his isolated problems.	6.0812157403541525
987. thus in no ordinary sense of 'simplicity'	is the ptolemaic theory simpler than the copernican.	4.749071605910154
988. the latter required	juggling several elements simultaneously.	7.869571950852667
989. this was not simpler	but much more difficult than exercises within ptolemy's astronomy.	5.542070754542027
990. analogously anyone who argues that einstein's theory of	gravitation is simpler than newton's must say rather more to explain	how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists while	the former can be managed only by accomplished experts.	5.222366487848096
991. in a sense einstein's theory is simpler than newton's	and there is a corresponding sense in which copernicus' theory	is simpler than ptolemy's.	4.833804625471466
992. but 'simplicity' here refers to	systematic simplicity.	8.351292733569213
993. the number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple	theories is reduced to a minimum.	5.270828815174544
994. the axioms required to	make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully	so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced	rigorously back to these axioms rules and primitive notions.	4.511345546953926
995. this	characterizes euclid's formulation of geometry but not ptolemy's	astronomy.	5.066959048406199
996. there are in the almagest no rules for determining	in advance whether a new epicycle will be required for dealing with	abberations in lunar solar or planetary behavior.	5.701740265778097
997. the strongest	appeal of the copernican formulation consisted in just this: ideally	the justification for dealing with special problems in particular	ways is completely set out in the basic 'rules' of the theory.	3.6932359051115764
998. the	lower-level hypotheses are never 'ad hoc' never introduced ex	post facto just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum.	5.160513208686437
999. copernicus to an extent unachieved by ptolemy approximated to	euclid's vision.	4.739649730906688
1000. de revolutionibus is not just a collection of	facts and techniques.	6.3597166371299005
1001. it is an organized system of these things.	6.337860894361929
1002. solving	astronomical problems requires for copernicus not a random search	of unrelated tables but a regular employment of the rules defining	the entire discipline.	5.103675880876918
1003. hence noting the simplicity achieved	in copernicus' formulation does not provide another reason for	the acceptance of de revolutionibus another reason beyond its	systematic superiority.	3.966566059426802
1004. it provides exactly the same reason.	10.699778348391193
1005. 1543 ad is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific	revolution.	4.535752126583474
1006. it is really the funeral day of scholastic science.	7.387043418584458
1007. granted	the cosmological philosophical and cultural reverberations	initiated by the de revolutionibus were felt with increasing violence	during the 300 years to follow.	3.841511969386553
1008. but considered within technical	astronomy a different pattern can be traced.	6.724597173527754
1009. in what does the	dissatisfaction of copernicus-the-astronomer consist?	6.205852435676169
1010.  what in the	almagest draws his fire?	9.288350657908774
1011.  geocentricism per se?	7.525342255260206
1012.  no.	14.778306436938408
1013. the	formal displacement of the geocentric principle far from being copernicus'	primary concern was introduced only to resolve what seemed	to him intolerable in orthodox astronomy namely the 'unphysical'	triplication of centric reference-points: one center from which	the planet's distances were calculated another around which planetary	velocities were computed and still a third center from	which the observations originated.	3.3698479754228394
1014. this arrangement was for copernicus	literally monstrous: with the ptolemaists it is as though	an artist were to gather the hands feet head and other members	for his images from divers models each part excellently drawn but not	related to a single body; and since they in no way match each other	the result would be a monster rather than a man.	4.855400601904633
1015. copernicus	required a systematically integrated physically intelligible astronomy.	5.3285636594893
1016. his objective was essentially to repair those aspects of orthodox	astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends.	5.417032158765409
1017. that such deficiencies existed within ptolemy's theory was not	discovered de novo by copernicus.	4.864007363440205
1018. the critical rigorous examinations	of nicholas of cusa and nicholas of oresme provided the context	for nicholas copernicus' own work.	4.939358304713113
1019. the latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies.	5.497549989974415
1020. without abandoning	too much copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically	and mechanically acceptable.	6.482924211985938
1021. he did not think himself to be	firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution.	5.137394072181762
1022. henrietta's feeling of identity with sara sullam was crowned by her	discovery of the coincidence that sara's epitaph in the jewish	cemetery in venice referred to her as the sulamite.	4.9822522738606105
1023. into	the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama henrietta	as every artist delights to do wove strands of her own intuitive insights	into human nature and-	especially in the remarkable story of the	attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters	as this pair- into the relations of men and women: in their	relations she was the giver and he the receiver nay the demander.	3.3132990214095246
1024. his	feeling always exacted sacrifices from her.	7.603896187885215
1025. h one is so accustomed	to think of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive and	women as submissive and yielding that our sympathies are usually enlisted	on the side of the man whose love is not returned and we condemn	the woman as a coquette h.	3.8743300502911096
1026. the very firmness of her convictions and	logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to	make greater efforts; usually this is most exasperating to men who	expect every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning her	sex and when she does not immediately condemn her as eccentric and	unwomanly h.	4.615190834176977
1027. she had the opportunity that few clever women can resist	of showing her superiority in argument over a man h.	4.3021308836676875
1028. women themselves	have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside	world and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities	of a stronger will even when their affections are withheld h.	5.0289426848627095
1029. she was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where	it can consistently be done.	4.918879861837699
1030. one who invites such trials of character	is either foolhardy overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith	in mankind to see the danger.	6.015108720155235
1031. in any case but the last such a course	is sure to avenge itself upon the individual; the moral powers	no more than the physical and mental can bear overstraining.	4.4274507420041305
1032. and in	the last case a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding	nature h.	5.921508243959613
1033. henrietta was discovering in the process of	writing as the born writer does not merely a channel for the discharge	of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the	creative powers of observation insight and intuition.	4.064398397431177
1034. dr	isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of	sara sullam that he considered submitting it to the century magazine	or harper's but he decided that its jewish subject probably	would not interest them and published it in the messenger	so our readers will be benefited instead.	5.228338895196195
1035. under her father's	influence it did not occur to henrietta that she might write on subjects	outside the jewish field but she did begin writing for other anglo-jewish	papers and thus increased her output and her audience.	3.739978443174063
1036. and	she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of judas maccabeus	performed at the hanukkah festival which came in december.	5.808531333421839
1037. by her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that	papa and mamma gave her a life of dickens as a spur to her aspiration.	3.8502688167845456
1038. another source of intellectual stimulus was opened	to her at that time by the founding of johns hopkins university within	walking distance of home.	5.746710693895102
1039. it was established in a couple of buildings	in the shopping district with only a few professors but all eminent	men and a few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings.	4.655013114083185
1040. in september '76 thomas huxley darwin's famous disciple came	from england to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening	of the university; and although it was a school for men only it	afforded henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures.	5.307541451123723
1041. in the following year her father undertook to give a course in hebrew	theology to johns hopkins students and this brought to the szold	house a group of bright young jews who had come to baltimore to	study and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by mamma and entertained	by henrietta and rachel who played and sang for them in the upstairs	sitting room on sunday evenings.	3.886047962303893
1042. from philadelphia came cyrus	adler and joseph	jastrow.	9.031467279561884
1043. adler judge sulzberger's nephew came to study assyriology.	5.066959048406199
1044. a smart shrewd and ambitious young man well connected and with	a knack for getting in the good graces of important people he was	bound to go far.	4.955511712727538
1045. joseph jastrow the younger son of the distinguished	rabbi marcus jastrow was a friendly round-faced fellow with a	little mustache whose field was psychology and who was also a punster	and a jolly tease.	3.7612577483720973
1046. his father was a good friend of rabbi szold and	joe lived with the szolds for a while.	6.39842015476962
1047. both these youths who greatly	admired henrietta were somewhat younger than she as were also	the neighboring friedenwald	boys who were then studying medicine;	and bright though they all were they could not possibly compete for	her interest with papa whose mind- although he never tried to dazzle	or patronize lesser lights with it- naturally eclipsed theirs and	made them seem to her even younger than they were.	3.3236014219202574
1048. besides miss henrietta-	as she was generally known since she had put up her hair	with a chignon in the back- had little time to spare them from her	teaching and writing; so cyrus adler became interested in her friend	racie friedenwald and joe jastrow- the only young man who when	he wrote had the temerity to address her as henrietta and signed	himself joe- fell in love with pretty sister rachel.	4.439187546142838
1049. henrietta	however was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with	joe's older and more serious brother morris who was just about	her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to philadelphia	with papa when he substituted for rabbi jastrow at rodeph	shalom temple there during its rabbi's absence in europe.	3.502267805743058
1050. young	morris who while attending the university of pennsylvania also	taught and edited a paper found time to write henrietta twenty-page	letters on everything that engaged his interest from the acting of sarah	bernhardt in philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of	sulamith on the jewish reform movement being promulgated by the	hebrew union college in cincinnati.	4.582286523595789
1051. unlike his younger brother	joe he never presumed to address her more familiarly than as my	dear friend although he praised and envied the elegance and purity	of her style.	3.802255470793435
1052. and when he complained of the lack of time for all	he wanted to do henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning	as she and papa did.	5.821771571914078
1053. one thing papa had not taught henrietta	was how to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated as	herself.	4.860647066960489
1054. she could not resist the opportunity of showing her superiority	in argument over a man which she had remarked as one of the	feminine follies of sara sullam; and in her forthright way	henrietta who in her story of sara had indicated her own unwillingness	to think of men as the privileged and women as submissive	and yielding felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers	to which morris jastrow took the slightest exception- he objected	to her stand on the corbin affair as well as on the radical reforms	of dr wise of hebrew union college- until once in sheer	desperation he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree	on anything.	4.607587225106322
1055. but that did not prevent him from writing more long letters	or from coming to spend his christmas vacations with the hospitable	lively szolds in their pleasant house on lombard street.	4.1026894321917995
1056. little women	we've got father and mother	and each other h said beth on the first page of louisa alcott's	little women; and i do think that families are the	most beautiful things in all the world burst out jo some five hundred	pages later in that popular story of the march family which had	first appeared when henrietta was eight; and the szold family as	it developed bore a striking resemblance to the marches.	4.808927046590469
1057. mr	march like benjamin szold was a clergyman although of an indeterminate	denomination; and marmee march like sophie szold	was the competent manager of her brood of girls of whom the marches	had only four to the szolds' five.	3.5431154366587463
1058. but the march girls had their	counterparts in the szold girls.	7.080973745718368
1059. henrietta could easily identify	herself with jo march although jo was not the eldest sister.	4.6066744487936075
1060. neither	was henrietta hoydenish like jo who frankly wished she were a	boy and had deliberately shortened her name which like henrietta's	was the feminine form of a boy's name.	5.141804601575669
1061. but both were high-spirited	and vivacious both had tempers to control both loved languages	especially english and german both were good teachers and wrote for	publication.	3.8567561298752464
1062. each was her mother's assistant and confidante; and	each stood out conspicuously in the family picture.	6.387703057626183
1063. bertha szold	was more like meg the eldest march girl who learned that a	woman's happiest kingdom is home her highest honor the art of ruling	it not as a queen but a wise wife and mother.	3.717071252212548
1064. bertha blue-eyed	like mamma was from the start her mother's daughter destined for	her mother's role in life.	5.772846931487155
1065. sadie like beth march suffered ill	health- got rheumatic fever and had to be careful of her heart-	but that never dampened her spirits.	4.2976703628039665
1066. when her right hand was incapacitated	by the rheumatism sadie learned to write with her left hand.	5.964219019278973
1067. she	wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments like oh	what fun! a comedy in three acts in which under personages	henrietta appeared as a schoolmarm and bertha	who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school than henrietta	had been appeared as dummkopf.	3.5272257098220026
1068. sadie studied piano; played	chopin in the soiree musicale of mr guthrie's pupils;	and she recited hector's farewell to andromache most	movingly to the special delight of rabbi jastrow at his home in germantown	near philadelphia where the szold girls took turns visiting	between the visits of the jastrow boys at the szolds' in baltimore.	4.531832522280041
1069. adele like amy the youngest of the marches was the rebellious	mischievous rather calculating and ambitious one.	4.060235568763422
1070. for rachel	conceded to be the prettiest of the szold girls- and she did make	a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing	in her silvery tones- there was no particular march counterpart;	but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences	the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere	if not entirely in content- the one being definitely jewish	and the other vaguely christian.	4.716739544887303
1071. the szolds like the marches	enjoyed and loved living together even in troubled times; and	as in the march home any young man who called on the szolds found	himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult	to direct his particular attention to any one of them.	3.4824311614787242
1072. this	included mamma jolly generous and pretty with whom they all fell	in love just as papa had first fallen in love with her mamma before	he chose her; and when a young man like morris jastrow had enjoyed	the szold hospitality he felt obliged to send his respects and	his gifts not merely to henrietta in whom he was really interested	but to all the szold girls and mamma.	4.55588696158738
1073. and just as laurie lawrence	was first attracted to bright jo march who found him immature	by her high standards and then had to content himself with her younger	sister amy so joe jastrow who had also been writing henrietta	before he came to johns hopkins had to content himself with her	younger sister pretty rachel.	3.4917707489908176
1074. and like jo march who saw her sisters	meg and amy involved in lovering before herself henrietta	saw her sisters rachel and sadie drawn outside their family circle	by the attraction of suitors rachel by joe jastrow and sadie by	max lo^bl a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions	of his trips by steamboat down the mississippi.	4.48346470874671
1075. this time he was making no mistake.	7.056748600323766
1076. olgivanna- in her country	the	nickname was a respectful form of address- was not only attractive but	shrewd durable sensible and smart.	5.559819518236458
1077. no wonder wright was enchanted-	no two better suited people ever met.	5.074602045349432
1078. almost from that day until	his death olgivanna was to stay at his side; but the years that	immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying both for wright	and his montenegrin lady.	5.611547754206363
1079. it must be granted that the flouting	of convention no matter how well intentioned one may be is sure	to lead to trouble or at least to the discomfort that goes with social	disapproval.	4.613610624558964
1080. even so many of the things that happened to wright	and olgivanna seem inordinately severe.	8.915526831076708
1081. their afflictions centered	on one maddening difficulty: miriam held up the divorce proceedings	that she herself had asked for.	4.20616604807918
1082. reporters began to trail miriam everywhere	and to encourage her to make appalling statements about wright	and his doings.	5.368720319504203
1083. flocks of writs attachments and unpleasant legal	papers of every sort began to fly through the air.	4.060235568763422
1084. the distracted miriam	would agree to a settlement through her legal representative then	change her mind and make another attack on wright as a person.	4.9961271477346605
1085. at	last her lawyer arthur d cloud gave up the case because she	turned down three successive settlements he arranged.	4.145816520035811
1086. cloud made an interesting	statement in parting from his client: i wanted to be	a lawyer and mrs wright wanted me to be an avenging angel.	5.692260060617906
1087. mrs wright is without funds.	6.902846367195701
1088. the first thing to do is	get her some money by a temporary but definite adjustment pending a final	disposition of the case.	5.78373450802553
1089. but every time i suggested this to her	mrs wright turned it down and demanded that i go out and punish	mr wright.	4.270157851407151
1090. i am an attorney not an instrument of vengeance.	7.646310828316733
1091. miriam noel disregarded the free advice of her departing counselor	and appointed a heavy-faced young man named harold jackson to take	his place.	3.87669233339106
1092. there were three years of this strange warfare;	and during the unhappy time miriam often would charge that wright and	olgivanna were misdemeanants against the public order of wisconsin.	5.5449084594963285
1093. yet somehow when officers were prodded into visiting taliesin to	execute the warrants they would find neither wright nor olgivanna	at home.	4.068897622763215
1094. this showed that common sense had not died out at the county	and village level- though why the unhappy and obviously unbalanced	woman was not restrained remains a puzzle.	5.175421213166576
1095. the misery of miriam's	bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case- it was	hopeless agonizing and destructive with miriam herself bearing the	heaviest burden of shame and pain.	3.4184935408954735
1096. to get an idea of the embarrassment	and chagrin that was heaped upon wright and olgivanna we	should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by miriam in person.	5.872704894595406
1097. one of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at spring	green toward the end of the open warfare on a beautiful day in june.	4.90647684298757
1098. at this time miriam noel appeared urging on constable henry pengally	whose name showed him to be a descendant of the welsh settlers	in the neighborhood.	6.681187372118496
1099. a troop of reporters brought up the rear.	5.0925007458095335
1100. miriam	was stopped at the taliesin gate and william weston now the	estate foreman came out to parley.	5.616228506893672
1101. he said that mr wright was	not in and so could not be arrested on something called a peace warrant	that miriam was waving in the air.	4.392744518274867
1102. miriam now ordered pengally to	break down the gate but he said he really couldn't go that far.	6.006914740298765
1103. at	this point mrs frances cupply one of wright's handsome daughters	by his first wife came from the house and tried to calm miriam	as she tore down a no visitors sign and smashed the glass pane	on another sign with a rock.	3.9059901498120655
1104. miriam noel wright said here	i am at my own home locked out so i must stand in the road!	then she rounded on weston and cried you always did wright's	dirty work! when i take over taliesin the first thing i'll	do is fire you.	4.659810209195131
1105. madame noel i think you had better	go said mrs cupply.	5.041489239202459
1106. and i think you had better	leave replied miriam.	9.949524964818936
1107. turning to the reporters she asked did	you hear her?	5.641442330939496
1108.  'i think you had better leave'! and this	is my own home.	6.093123995732186
1109. in the silence that followed miriam walked close	to mrs cupply who drew back a step on her side of the gate.	4.494424283280482
1110. then	with staring eyes and lips drawn thin miriam said to the young woman	you are ugly- uglier than you used to be and you were always	very ugly.	5.565590097331215
1111. you are even uglier than mr wright.	6.963065504050738
1112. the	animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a	natural force; and it gave miriam noel a fund of energy like that	of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art.	4.661715224078439
1113. as if to make certain that wright would be unable to pay any settlement	at all miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him; she	also went to washington and appealed to senator george william	norris of nebraska the fighting liberal from whose office a sympathetic	but cautious harrumphing was heard.	3.6448762322998363
1114. then after overtures to	accept a settlement and go through with a divorce miriam gave a ghastly	echo of mrs micawber by suddenly stating i will never leave	mr wright.	5.0641251477259965
1115. under this kind of pressure it is not	surprising that wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers.	4.834678078322579
1116. miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly but one	can feel the generalized anger in wright's remarks to reporters	when he was asked one morning on arrival in chicago what he thought	of the city as a whole.	4.635671209171306
1117. first wright said he was choked by the smoke	which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town.	4.741727070376354
1118. but surely	michigan avenue was handsome?	9.085383511981039
1119.  that isn't a boulevard it's	a racetrack! cried wright showing that automobiles were considered	to be a danger as early as the 1920's.	4.323981422417892
1120. this is a horrible	way to live wright went on.	7.980894149394633
1121. you are being strangled by traffic.	7.594128875441939
1122. he was then asked for a solution of the difficulty and began	to talk trenchant sense though private anguish showed through in the	vehemence of his manner.	5.701659449446798
1123. take a gigantic knife and sweep it over	the loop wright said.	5.176264037639724
1124. cut off every building at the seventh	floor.	8.224529324157329
1125. you don't need concentration.	8.776350999366766
1126. if	you cut down these horrible buildings you'll have no more traffic jams.	6.175186098381726
1127. you'll have some joy in the life of	this city.	5.322377496391928
1128. after all that's the job of the architect- to give	the world a little joy.	6.991950535938704
1129. little enough joy was afforded wright	in the spring of 1925 when another destructive fire broke out at taliesin.	4.1536614289330025
1130. the first news stories had it that this blaze was started by	a bolt of lightning as though miriam could call down fire from heaven	like a prophet of the old testament.	5.343821731469745
1131. a storm did take place that	night and fortunately enough it included a cloudburst that helped put	out the flames.	3.9147703487056127
1132. later accounts blamed defective wiring for starting	the fire; at any rate heat grew so intense in the main part of the	house that it melted the window panes and fused the k'ang-si pottery	to cinders.	5.153367296274285
1133. wright set his loss at $200000 a figure perhaps justified	by the unique character of the house that had been ruined and	the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and	other things that were destroyed.	4.123688748976403
1134. in spite of the disaster wright	completed during this period plans for the lake tahoe resort in which	he suggested the shapes of american indian tepees- a project of	great and appropriate charm that came to nothing.	5.298179433470471
1135. amid a shortage of	profitable work the memory of albert johnson's $20000 stood out	in lonely grandeur- the money had quickly melted away.	3.995168868824091
1136. a series of	conferences with friends and bankers began about this time; and the	question before these meetings was here is a man of international reputation	and proved earning power; how can he be financed so that he	can find the work he ought to do?	5.1843370604729
1137.  while this was under consideration	dauntless as ever wright set about the building of taliesin 3.	4.533298225767546
1138. as he made plans for the new taliesin wright also got on	paper his conception of a cathedral of steel and glass to house a congregation	of all faiths and the idea for a planetarium with a sloping	ramp.	5.62397252607381
1139. years were to pass before these plans came off the paper and	wright was justified in thinking as the projects failed that much	of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except	by visitors to taliesin.	3.9088973914406093
1140. and now there was some question as to	his continued residence there.	7.23284742900056
1141. billy koch who had once worked for	wright as a chauffeur gave a deposition for miriam's use that he	had seen olgivanna living at taliesin.	3.871685519470893
1142. this might put wright in such	a bad light before a court that miriam would be awarded taliesin;	nor was she moved by a letter from wright pointing out that if he	was not compelled to spend money on useless lawyer's bills useless	hotel bills and useless doctor's bills he could more quickly	provide miriam with a suitable home either in los angeles or paris	as she preferred.	4.732665411335846
1143. miriam sniffed at this and complained that wright	had said unkind things about her to reporters.	4.131860641767443
1144. his reply was everything	that has been printed derogatory to you purporting to have	come from me was a betrayal and nothing yet has been printed which	i have sanctioned.	4.954634904009367
1145. what irritated miriam was that wright had told	the papers about a reasonable offer he had made which he considered	she would accept when she tires of publicity.	3.9704902578347134
1146. from her california	headquarters miriam fired back i shall never divorce mr	wright to permit him to marry olga milanoff.	5.759841215282447
1147. then miriam	varied the senseless psychological warfare by suddenly withdrawing	a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending and asking	for divorce on the grounds of cruelty with the understanding that wright	would not contest it.	3.877229303772231
1148. the bank of wisconsin sent a representative	to the judge's chambers in madison to give information on wright's	ability to meet the terms.	5.250676786075997
1149. he said that the architect might reasonably	be expected to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment	could be brought to an end and that the bank would accept a mortgage	on taliesin to help bring this about.	4.148450597731054
1150. miriam said that she must be	assured that that other woman olga will not be in luxury while i	am scraping along.	6.0305890499232895
1151. this exhausted wright's patience and in consequence	he talked freely to reporters in a madison hotel suite.	4.171714683607608
1152. volstead	laws speed laws divorce laws he said as they now	stand demoralize the individual make liars and law breakers of us in	one way or another and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd.	4.829133693886328
1153. if mrs wright doesn't accept the terms in the morning i'll	go either to tokyo or to holland to do what i can.	4.263045872905422
1154. i realize	in taking this stand just what it means to me and mine.	7.367970171939153
1155. here wright	gave a slight sigh of weariness and continued it means more	long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people	making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding	as i best can for myself and those dependent upon me.	4.116817566908844
1156. next	day word came that miriam was not going through with the divorce;	but wright stayed in the united states.	6.602614215593962
1157. his mentioning of japan and	holland had been merely the expression of wishful thinking.	4.437450999192512
1158. no matter	what troubles might betide him this most american of artists knew	in his heart he could not function properly outside his native land.	5.527942491195616
1159. in a few weeks miriam made another sortie at taliesin but	was repulsed at the locked and guarded gates.	4.92201698510604
1160. more likely you simply told yourself as you handed us the book that	it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline	of incantation.	5.319566048081392
1161. for pride's sake i will not say that	the coy and leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself into	my soul.	4.105474124895958
1162. besides that particular message does no more than weakly echo	the roar in all fresh blood.	6.6290355223046955
1163. but what you could not know of course	was how smoothly the victorian fitzgerald was to lead into an american	fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents	were to come if not of age then into a bright taut semblance of it.	3.6584177671966476
1164. i do not suppose you ever heard of f scott fitzgerald living	or dead and moreover i do not suppose that even if you had his legend	would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval.	5.8353252406637335
1165. neither his appetites his exacerbations nor his despair were	kin to yours.	5.0491287615491505
1166. he might have been the man in the moon for all you could	have understood him.	8.447077229451489
1167. but he was no man in the moon to me.	7.177823621267668
1168. although	his tender nights were not the ones i dreamed of nor was it for yachts	sports cars tall drinks and swimming pools nor yet for money or	what money buys that i burned i too was burning and watching myself	burn.	4.642157134710469
1169. the flame was simply of a different kind.	4.645839058003088
1170. it was symbolized	by that	self-consuming elegiac candle of edna st vincent millay's	that candle which from the quatrain where she ensconced it became a	beacon to us but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall	as a funeral taper to last even the evening let alone the night.	5.234378001835497
1171. one	should not of course pluck the head off a flower and expect its perfume	to linger on.	4.060235568763422
1172. yet this passion for passion now that i look back	on it with passion spent seems somewhat overblown and operatic though	as a diva miss millay perfectly controlled her notes.	5.16148542660589
1173. only what	else was she singing but the old song of songs that most ancient	of tunes that nature plays with such unfailing response upon young nerves?	3.892636911762473
1174. 	perhaps this is not so little.	11.21786842629924
1175. perhaps the mere fact that by	plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us temporarily	anyway the sleeping poet and in poets can discover their	immortality is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to	which we can attest?	4.0266731324084075
1176.  one can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone	casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives	for a lover or a friend; one can take it as no more than another	veil torn from the mystery of the soul.	5.176221674235331
1177. but it could also be looked	at from the other end of the spectrum.	7.219338580390836
1178. one could see this chemical determinant	as in itself a miracle.	7.869766011509509
1179. in any case miss millay's sweet-throated	bitterness her variations on the theme that the world was	not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love her constant	and wonderfully tragic posture so unlike that of fitzgerald since	it required no scenery or props drew from the me that i was when	i fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea.	3.4845376433357123
1180. but all this i	am well aware is the bel canto of love and although i have always	liked to think that it was to the bel canto and to that alone	that i listened i know well enough that it was not.	5.626784666001088
1181. if i am to speak	the whole truth about my knowledge of love i will have to stop	trying to emulate the transcendant nightingale.	4.718976275396865
1182. there is another side	of love more nearly symbolized by the croak of the mating capercailzie	or better still perhaps by the mute antics of the slug.	5.3613783727571045
1183. whether	you experienced the passion of desire i have of course no way	of knowing nor indeed have i wished with even the most fleeting fragment	of a wish to know for the fact that one constitutes by one's	mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any	speculation upon this part of one's parents' experience more immodest	more scandalizing more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from	a stranger.	3.5743742360755006
1184. i recoil from the very thought.	8.882676667812733
1185. at the same time i am	aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves	at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign since theirs is a science	of paradox: if one hates they say it is because one loves;	if one bullies they say it is because one is afraid; if one shuns	they say it is because one desires; and according to them whatever	one fancies one feels what one feels in fact is the opposite.	3.7029171617063454
1186. well	normally abnormal or normally normal neurotic or merely fastidious		i have never wanted to know what you knew of passion.	5.47576011909098
1187. you	probably would not remember since you never seemed to remember	even	the same moments as i much less their intensity one sunny midday on	fifth avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping	less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance	at the farm.	3.37411739242904
1188. i can see us now.	11.279912617042745
1189. we had been walking quite briskly	for despite your being so small and me so tall your stride in those	days could easily match mine.	4.140392035311827
1190. we had stopped before a shop window	to assess its autumnal display when you suddenly turned to me looking	up from beneath one of your wrong hats and with your nervous ahem!	said: there are things i must tell you about this man you	are marrying which he does not know himself.	5.064835628237302
1191. if you had screamed	right there in the street where we stood i could not have felt more	fear.	5.125231330578881
1192. with scarcely a mumble of excuse i fled.	7.7607638923264295
1193. i fled however	not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise	from you that the things about my bridegroom- in the sense you	meant the word things- which you had been galvanizing yourself	to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which	i had already insisted upon finding out for myself	say the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle	because i was resolved as	a modern woman not to be a mollycoddle waiting for life but to seize	life by the throat.	3.724873587087141
1194. i had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid	of self-betrayal.	7.241055879898811
1195. what i fled from was my fear of what unwittingly	you might betray without meaning to about my father and yourself.	4.279256503553799
1196. but i can see from this latest trick of memory how much	more arbitrary and influential it is than the will.	5.852469491628185
1197. while my memory	holds with relentless tenacity as i cannot too often stress to my wrongs	when it comes to my shames it gestures and jokes and toys with	chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distracting me from	them.	3.7667485632928694
1198. just as i was about to enlarge upon my discovery of the underside	of the leaf of love memory displeased at being asked to yield its	unsavory secrets dashed ahead of me calling back over its shoulder:	skip it.	5.157790816112915
1199. but i will not skip it or cut it	out.	6.145183023160923
1200. it is not my intention in this narrative to picture myself as a helpless	victim moored to the rock of experience and left to the buffetings	of chance.	5.5338913508805785
1201. if to be innocent is to be helpless then i had been-	as are we all- helpless at the start.	4.828934230355076
1202. but the time came when i was	no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless.	6.627760346438827
1203. helpless in that	sense i can never be again.	5.388951754102495
1204. however i confess my hope that i	will be innocent again not with a pristine accidental innocence but	rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh	to reach the bone.	4.906919454167838
1205. for innocence of all the graces of the	spirit is i believe the one most to be prayed for.	4.752001602395765
1206. although it is constantly	made to look foolish	it does not	mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks.	7.146202781532704
1207. it assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best and when	they seem worst it overlooks them.	4.165528738288654
1208. to innocence a word given is a word	that will be kept.	6.550827809061843
1209. instinctively innocence does unto others as it	expects to be done by.	5.03798565006237
1210. but when these expectations are once too often	ground into the dust innocence can falter since its strength is according	to the strength of him who possesses it.	5.4926304937690436
1211. the innocence of which	i speak is i know not incorruptible.	4.260685282778794
1212. but i insist upon believing	that even when it is lost it may like paradise be regained.	7.285506087359589
1213. however it was not of innocence in general that i was speaking	but of perhaps the frailest and surely the least important side of	it which is innocence in romantic love.	4.265575391529559
1214. here if anywhere it is not	wholly incontrovertible.	8.551930392345666
1215. to you for instance the word innocence in	this connotation probably retained its biblical or should i say	technical sense and therefore i suppose i must make myself quite clear	by saying that i lost- or rather handed over- what you would	have considered to be my innocence two weeks before i was legally entitled	and in fact by oath required to hand it over along with what other	goods and bads i had.	3.309242378316711
1216. but to me innocence is far less tangible.	8.68777516429652
1217. i had long since begun to lose my general innocence when i lost my	trust in you but this special innocence i lost before ever i loved	through my discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience	a flaming delight that had nothing nothing whatever to do with	friendship or liking let alone with love.	3.4755565704537954
1218. i knew this knowledge to	be corrupting at the time i acquired it; today these many years later	after all the temptations resisted or yielded to the weasel satisfactions	and the engulfing dissatisfactions since endured i call it	corrupting still.	5.206642651408468
1219. you i could swear to it remained innocent	in this sense until the end.	4.893812188888004
1220. yours but not mine was an age in which	innocence was fostered and carefully- if not perhaps altogether	innocently- preserved.	5.2920541105344485
1221. you had grown up at a time when the most distinguishing	mark of a lady was the noli me tangere writ plain across	her face.	4.870571286925575
1222. moreover because of the particular blot on your family	escutcheon through what may only have been one unbridled moment on your	grandmother's part and because you had the lean-to kitchen and trundle	bed of your childhood to outgrow what you obviously most desired	with both your conscious and unconscious person what you bent your	whole will sensibility and intelligence upon was to be a lady.	4.938569528959274
1223. before	being daughter wife or mother before being cultured	bereft both socially and politically of the sheen you children of frontiersmen	before being sorry for the poor progressive	about public health and prettily if somewhat imprecisely humanitarian	indeed first and foremost you were a lady.	3.465468984564005
1224. there was of course	more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your mind's eye than	the sine qua non of her virtue.	5.669685419815286
1225. a lady you made clear to me both	by precept and example never raised her voice or slumped in her chair	never failed in social tact	never pouted or withdrew or	scandalized in company never reminded others of her physical presence	by unseemly sound or gesture never indulged in public scenes or private	confidences never spoke of money save in terms of alleviating suffering	never gossiped or maligned never stressed but always minimized	the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself.	3.284869343701976
1226. with each song he gave verbal footnotes.	8.252155925053561
1227. the songs sandburg sang often	reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely	or in fragments.	3.7179193381860367
1228. often these listeners would refer sandburg to persons	who had similar ballads or ditties.	6.355988913435821
1229. in due time sandburg was	a walking thesaurus of american folk music.	4.986040423993185
1230. after he had finished	the first two volumes of his lincoln sandburg went to work	assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the	memory of songs others had taught him.	5.085641667577758
1231. he rummaged found composers	and arrangers collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization	with musicians ballad singers and musicologists.	3.969704809519161
1232. the	result was a collection of 280 songs ballads ditties brought together	from all regions of america more than one hundred never before published:	the american songbag.	5.738870305529158
1233. each song or ditty was prefaced	by an author's note which indicated the origin and meaning of the	song as well as special interest the song had musical arrangement	and most of the chorus and verses.	4.194651568385939
1234. the book published in 1927	has been selling steadily ever since.	5.85388278353001
1235. as sandburg said at the time:	it is as ancient as the medieval european ballads brought to	the appalachian mountains it is as modern as skyscrapers the volstead	act and the latest oil well gusher.	3.7514360431448828
1236. sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer.	6.806723317680827
1237. two things	contribute to his popularity.	7.194228478107291
1238. first carl respects his audience and	prepares his speeches carefully.	7.48768204013523
1239. even when he is called upon for impromptu	remarks he has notes written on the back of handy envelopes.	5.6748778387176095
1240. he has his own system of shorthand devised by abbreviations: humility	will be humly with will be w and that	will be tt.	5.544550669623459
1241. the second reason for his popularity	is his complete spontaneity with the guitar.	4.733158777212496
1242. it is a mistake however	to imagine that sandburg uses the guitar as a prop.	6.359869934703692
1243. he is no dextrous-fingered	college boy but rather a dedicated humble and bashful	apostle of this instrument.	4.831406265295934
1244. at age seventy-four he became what he	shyly terms a pupil of andres segovia the great guitarist of	the western world.	5.638558876005445
1245. it is not easy to become segovia's pupil.	6.635990599229168
1246. segovia has written about carl:	his fingers labor heavily on the strings and he asked for my help	in disciplining them.	5.335989950297656
1247. i found that this precocious grown-up boy of	74 deserved to be taught.	5.154753979337925
1248. there has long existed a brotherly affection	between us thus i accepted him as my pupil.	6.567438362164409
1249. just as in the case of	every prodigy child we must watch for the efficacy of my teaching to	show up in the future- if he should master all the strenuous exercises	i inflicted on him.	4.492725411699642
1250. to play the guitar as he aspires will	devour his three-fold energy as a historian a poet and a singer.	5.818179797332961
1251. one	cause of schopenhauer's pessimism was the fact that he failed to	learn the guitar.	5.385581345885674
1252. i am certain that carl sandburg will not fall into	the same sad philosophy.	6.531010144044969
1253. the heart of this great poet constantly bubbles	forth a generous joy of life- with or without the guitar.	4.3105910431312875
1254. the public's identification of carl sandburg and the guitar	is no happenstance.	5.506908456901043
1255. nor does carl reject this identity.	7.063241195988104
1256. he	is proud of having segovia for a friend and dedicated a poem to him	titled the guitar.	5.844268088011846
1257. carl says it is the greatest poem	ever written to the guitar because he has never heard of any other poem	to that subtle instrument.	4.5301187594932255
1258. a portable companion always ready to	go where you go- a small friend weighing less than a freshborn infant-	to be shared with few or many- just two of you in sweet meditation.	5.016316872424315
1259. the new york herald tribune's photographer	ira rosenberg tells an anecdote about the time he wanted to take a	picture of carl playing a guitar.	4.473788146234936
1260. carl hadn't brought his along.	8.18656221502958
1261. mr	rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one.	5.273636924865989
1262. preferably	said carl one battered and worn such as might be found	in a pawnshop.	5.967505951953756
1263. they went to the pawnshop of joseph miller	of 1162 sixth avenue.	5.782768803265786
1264. mr miller was in the shop	the herald tribune story related but was reluctant to have	anybody's picture taken inside because his business was too 'confidential'	for pictures.	5.512347401728161
1265. but after introductions he asked:	'carl sandburg?	7.005224812470407
1266.  well you can pose inside'.	10.018832946108885
1267. he wanted mr sandburg to pose with one of the guitars he had	displayed behind glass in the center of his shop but the poet eyed this	somewhat distastefully.	4.701137396536558
1268. 'kalamazoo guitars' he said 'used	by radio hillbilly singers'.	6.806723317680827
1269. he chose one from mr miller's	window a plain guitar with no fancy polish.	4.427919237137663
1270. while the picture	was taken mr miller's disposition to be generous to mr	sandburg increased to the point where he advised 'i won't even	charge you the one dollar rental fee'.	5.555853196794591
1271. when someone in the audience rose and asked how does it feel to	be a celebrity carl said a celebrity is a fellow who eats celery	with celerity.	3.9586524895821524
1272. this has always been carl's attitude.	9.542669571773287
1273. lloyd lewis wrote that when he first knew carl in 1916 sandburg was	making $27.	4.679253579520834

1275. he walked home at night	for two miles beyond the end of a suburban trolley.	5.503580533243105
1276. when fame	came it changed sandburg only slightly.	8.184789206340353
1277. lewis remembered another newspaperman	asking carl have your ideas changed any since you got	all these comforts?	4.131860641767443
1278.    carl thought the question over slowly	and answered: i know a starving man who is fed never remembers	all the pangs of his starvation i know that.	5.167713380038901
1279. that was all	he said lewis reports.	7.407432776519646
1280. that was all he had to say.	10.811795775850896

1282. it changes with every generation.	10.664100278650636
1283. there	never were two fames alike.	6.094118058689911
1284. one fame is precious and luminous; another	is a bubble of a bauble.	6.455667702362499
1285. plain?	11.00104558771429

1333. for two years in the normal school at valley city north dakota	then two years at princeton by	the time the streetcar pulled away he had fallen in love with paula.	4.205963216732995
1334. a letter awaited her at princeton.	7.497159691564029
1335. paula says that even	though carl's letters usually began dear miss steichen there	was an understanding from the beginning that they would become husband	and wife.	4.1337630427615935
1336. paula generously lent me one of carl's love	letters dated february 21 1908 hotel athearn oshkosh wisconsin:	dear miss steichen: it is a very good letter you	send me- softens the intensity of this guerilla warfare i am carrying	on up here.	5.116248913107026
1337. never until in this work of s-d organization	have i realized and felt the attitude and experience of a teacher.	4.185907054373999
1338. the united states is always ready to participate with the soviet	union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that	may lead to peace with justice.	5.557305792852742
1339. certainly it is not necessary	to repeat that the united states has no intention of interfering in	the internal affairs of any nation; by the same token we reject any	soviet attempt to impose its system on us or other peoples by force	or subversion.	4.440620128665614
1340. now this concern for the freedom of other peoples	is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with	more than forty other nations in a common defense effort.	5.646230338991352
1341. not for a	moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these	countries; we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our	solemn commitments to them.	4.214209281556818
1342. we and our friends are of course	concerned with self-defense.	7.172454775627937
1343. growing out of this concern is the realization	that all people of the free world have a great stake in the	progress in freedom of the uncommitted and newly emerging nations.	4.542841391987836
1344. these peoples desperately hoping to lift themselves to decent levels	of living must not by our neglect be forced to seek help from and	finally become virtual satellites of those who proclaim their hostility	to freedom.	5.0778469518894225
1345. but they must have technical and investment assistance.	6.494328573829739
1346. this is a problem to be solved not by america alone but also	by every nation cherishing the same ideals and in position to provide	help.	6.01872687595702
1347. in recent years america's partners and friends in	western europe and japan have made great economic progress.	4.850058809953305
1348. the international economy of 1960 is markedly different from that of	the early postwar years.	5.49942105793858
1349. no longer is the united states the only major	industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the	resources so urgently needed in the newly developed countries.	4.6361076466682185
1350. to remain secure and prosperous themselves wealthy nations must extend	the kind of co-operation to the less fortunate members that will	inspire hope confidence and progress.	5.156366874106216
1351. a rich nation can for a time	without noticeable damage to itself pursue a course of self-indulgence	making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens-	thus repudiating its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful	and prosperous society of nations.	3.4482478205886884
1352. but the enmities it will incur	the isolation into which it will descend and the internal moral	and spiritual softness that will be engendered will in the long term	bring it to economic and political disaster.	5.50644135917502
1353. america did not	become great through softness and self-indulgence.	5.6724103158360535
1354. her miraculous progress	in material achievements flows from other qualities far more worthy	and substantial: adherence to principles and methods consonant	with our religious philosophy; a satisfaction in hard work; the readiness	to sacrifice for worthwhile causes; the courage to meet every	challenge; the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the	true path of her own best interests.	4.606968599692038
1355. to us and to every nation	of the free world rich or poor these qualities are necessary today	as never before if we are to march together to greater security prosperity	and peace.	4.205162172544679
1356. i believe that the industrial countries are	ready to participate actively in supplementing the efforts of the developing	nations to achieve progress.	7.164558328909925
1357. the immediate need for	this kind of co-operation is underscored by the strain in this nation's	international balance of payments.	3.8061424260810623
1358. our surplus from foreign business	transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the	expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments overseas	to finance private investment and to provide assistance to the	less developed nations.	5.202428246252481
1359. in 1959 our deficit in balance of payments	approached four billion dollars.	5.219645596296622
1360. continuing deficits of anything	like this magnitude would over time impair our own economic growth	and check the forward progress of the free world.	5.267924301760574
1361. we must	meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and world	trade.	4.629594649939228
1362. further we must induce all industrialized nations of the free	world to work together to help lift the scourge of poverty from less	fortunate.	5.679421142408432
1363. this co-operation in this matter will provide both for	the necessary sharing of this burden and in bringing about still further	increases in mutually profitable trade.	3.9116212302993043
1364. new nations and	others struggling with the problems of development will progress only-	regardless of any outside help- if they demonstrate faith in their	own destiny and use their own resources to fulfill it.	5.1720863025776165
1365. moreover	progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned;	there is no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane.	3.722863362877958
1366. but just as we drew on europe for assistance in our earlier years	so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith	and determination deserve help.	4.982027657206642
1367. respecting their need one of	the major focal points of our concern is the south-asian region.	4.131860641767443
1368. here	in two nations alone are almost five hundred million people all working	and working hard to raise their standards and in doing so to	make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology	that would destroy liberty.	4.870515426270759
1369. i cannot express to you the depth	of my conviction that in our own and free world interest we must co-operate	with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions	as expressed in their different multi-year plans.	3.7939677380219576
1370. through the	world bank and other instrumentalities as well as through individual	action by every nation in position to help we must squarely face	this titanic challenge.	5.863835441581062
1371. i shall continue to urge the american	people in the interests of their own security prosperity and peace	to make sure that their own part of this great project be amply and	cheerfully supported.	4.2992368838942685
1372. free world decisions in this matter may spell the	difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom.	5.702557624328426
1373. other countries some of which i visited last month have similar	needs.	5.524030182566887
1374. a common meeting ground is desirable for those nations	which are prepared to assist in the development effort.	5.778586528414069
1375. during the	past year i have discussed this matter with the leaders of several western	nations.	4.955451337755889
1376. because of its wealth of experience the organization	for european economic cooperation could help with the initial	studies needed.	6.429508230345101
1377. the goal is to enlist all available economic resources	in the industrialized free world especially private investment	capital.	3.948466563449902
1378. by extending this help we hope to make possible the	enthusiastic enrollment of these nations under freedom's banner.	5.7103354047175205
1379. no more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be	imagined.	5.600957194378268
1380. if we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive	partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have	already achieved a high state of economic advancement we will make	brighter the outlook for a world order based upon security and freedom.	5.152209621874282
1381. otherwise the outlook could be dark indeed.	6.2079038694001705
1382. we face indeed what	may be a turning point in history and we must act decisively and wisely.	5.693685624831177
1383. as a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives	only from a position of broadly based strength.	4.6351508120831895
1384. no matter how	earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace we must maintain a high degree	of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating	the issue of arms reduction.	5.799528777244824
1385. until tangible and mutually enforceable	arms reduction measures are worked out we will not weaken the	means of defending our institutions.	4.291510824251164
1386. america possesses an enormous	defense power.	9.516163426235378
1387. it is my studied conviction that no nation will ever	risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as	to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support.	3.6657796076899634
1388. it is world-wide	knowledge that any power which might be tempted today to attack	the united states by surprise even though we might sustain great	losses would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction.	5.0593999878750076
1389. but i once	again assure all peoples and all nations that the united states	except in defense will never turn loose this destructive power.	4.675293496597127
1390. during the past year our long-range striking power unmatched today	in manned bombers has taken on new strength as the atlas intercontinental	ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory.	5.609658878329141
1391. in	fourteen recent test launchings at ranges of five thousand miles atlas	has been striking on an average within two miles of the target.	3.8239897056502956
1392. this is less than the length of a jet runway- well within the circle	of destruction.	7.915513005484406
1393. incidentally there was an atlas firing last	night.	6.49049680202602
1394. from all reports so far received its performance conformed to	the high standards i have just described.	6.551425757715392
1395. such performance is a great	tribute to american scientists and engineers who in the past five	years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range	ballistic missiles where america had none before.	4.250362290168217
1396. this	year moreover growing numbers of nuclear powered submarines will	enter our active forces some to be armed with polaris missiles.	5.491438337082449
1397. these	remarkable ships and weapons ranging the oceans will be capable of	accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth.	3.9394316778493597
1398. to meet	situations of less than general nuclear war we continue to maintain	our carrier forces our many service units abroad our always ready	army strategic forces and marine corps divisions and the civilian	components.	4.958572113510676
1399. the continuing modernization of these forces is a costly	but necessary process.	4.09934505004725
1400. it is scheduled to go forward at a rate which	will steadily add to our strength.	6.816070516244305
1401. the deployment of a portion	of these forces beyond our shores on land and sea is persuasive demonstration	of our determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our	allies for collective security.	3.4363117066526185
1402. moreover i have directed that steps	be taken to program on a longer range basis our military assistance to	these allies.	5.633177580431578
1403. this is necessary for a sounder collective defense system.	6.506325770039989
1404. next i refer to our program in space exploration which	is often mistakenly supposed to be an integral part of defense research	and development.	6.146051179276166
1405. we note that first america has already	made	great contributions in the past two years to the world's fund of	knowledge of astrophysics and space science.	4.454066589444211
1406. these discoveries are of	present interest chiefly to the scientific community; but they are	important foundation stones for more extensive exploration of outer space	for the ultimate benefit of all mankind.	4.9418584405379775
1407. second our military	missile program going forward so successfully does not suffer from	our present lack of very large rocket engines which are necessary	in distant space exploration.	3.837640677711007
1408. i am assured by experts that the thrust	of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements.	5.923701738876842
1409. third the united states is pressing forward in the development	of large rocket engines to place vehicles of many tons into space	for exploration purposes.	4.5726567726502845
1410. fourth in the meantime it is necessary	to remember that we have only begun to probe the environment immediately	surrounding the earth.	5.84937576557491
1411. using launch systems presently available	we are developing satellites to scout the world's weather; satellite	relay stations to facilitate and extend communications over the	globe; for navigation aids to give accurate bearings to ships and	aircraft; and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit the	data we seek.	3.4711968575491046
1412. fifth we have just completed a year's experience	with our new space law.	6.30968334249359
1413. i believe it deficient in certain particulars.	7.113004869046302
1414. suggested improvements will be submitted to the congress shortly.	7.05100976207356
1415. the accomplishment of the many tasks i have alluded to requires	the continuous strengthening of the spiritual intellectual	and	economic sinews of american life.	3.797250687854567
1416. the steady purpose of our society	is to assure justice before god for every individual.	5.201903170649684
1417. we must be	ever alert that freedom does not wither through the careless amassing	of restrictive controls or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the	issues of the day.	4.185381126326838
1418. a year ago when i met with you the nation	was emerging from an economic downturn even though the signs of resurgent	prosperity were not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful.	5.5008135785090015
1419. today our surging strength is apparent to everyone.	5.9799954867165654
1420. 1960 promises	to be the most prosperous year in our history.	7.027030854290625
1421. yet we continue	to be afflicted by nagging disorders.	6.04791955809758
1422. among current problems that	require solutions participated in by citizens as well as government	are:   the need to protect the public interest in situations of	prolonged labor-management stalemate;   the persistent refusal	to come to grips with a critical problem in one sector of american agriculture;	the continuing threat of inflation together with	the persisting tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility;   in certain	instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection	of the law.	4.817798100702656
1423. the group upon the issuance of its first press release on december	21 1957 designated itself a committee of investigation.	4.112769669339599
1424. in the course of its inquiry it took testimony from only seven witnesses.	7.091080243929411
1425. it heard bang-jensen twice and his lawyer adolf a berle	jr once.	5.041469536611291
1426. its second press release was on january 15	1958 and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed.	5.990906070786331
1427. it also	implied that paul bang-jensen had been irresponsible.	5.782720307653081
1428. on	january 18 ernest gross conducted a press conference at the un	lasting an hour.	6.444923241401702
1429. here he openly attacked bang-jensen and referred	to his aberrant conduct.	5.463061738454144
1430. this conference was held despite	stavropoulos' assurance to adolf berle who was leaving the same	day for puerto rico that nothing would be done until his return on	january 22 except that the secretary general would probably order	the list destroyed.	5.2028046828637295
1431. on january 24 paul bang-jensen accompanied	by adolf berle was met by dragoslav protitch and colonel	frank begley former police chief of farmington conn and now	head of un special police.	3.8378307277477868
1432. the four bundled in overcoats	mounted to the wind-swept roof of the un   there	begley lit a fire in a wire basket and bang-jensen dropped four	sealed envelopes into the flames.	4.592147308755053
1433. in one of these he said were notes	on the identities of the eighty-one refugees.	6.016111642907147
1434. the method of destroying	the evidence embarrassed paul bang-jensen.	6.65346927566893
1435. he knew it would	be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence.	6.451078065807567
1436. he was	right and peter marshall could not help but recall andrew cordier's	words on the subject well it seemed as good a place as any	to do the job.	5.311410533370238
1437. the gross group had been formed for the express	purpose of advising the secretary general.	3.9858096083160164
1438. hammarskjold's supposed	desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of ernest gross	is illusion at best.	5.508743333263307
1439. gross's being outside the un	applied only to a physical state not an objective one.	4.21292691591616
1440. but by the	time the papers were finally disposed of the group had informed the	world of its purpose its recommendations and its belief that paul	bang-jensen was not of sound mind.	5.310798739575775
1441. shortly the group would issue	its report to the secretary general recommending paul bang-jensen's	dismissal from the united nations.	4.7977322862337815
1442. the contents of this	195-page document would become known to many before it would become known	to the man it was written about.	4.886183021893319
1443. until this hungarian	committee matter came up bang-jensen was a fine and devoted individual.	4.856578580682437
1444. i had known him for some years when i was a delegate and before	and this manner had never been his.	6.649562788989033
1445. ernest a gross	leaned back in his chair and told peter marshall how secretary general	dag hammarskjold had on december 41957 called him in as a	private lawyer to review bang-jensen's conduct relating to his	association with the special committee on the problem of hungary.	3.5855635034149818
1446. the result was the gross report prepared by gross as chairman	with the assistance of two un under secretaries constantin	stavropoulos and philippe de seynes.	5.183481172451537
1447. yes gross	went on bang-jensen was an up-and-coming young man.	5.517515678162371
1448. he had	always done well.	9.53100541324648
1449. never well known but he had done his work competently	h.	5.752129323277727
1450. gross had received marshall courteously and they	were discussing the case.	6.289010577019261
1451. you know the lawyer said it's	difficult to talk like this about a man who can't answer back.	5.4660028986583225
1452. gross was behind a clean-top desk only a manila folder before	him.	6.093123995732186
1453. marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs.	6.251011449311033
1454. outside the	office windows twenty-four stories above wall street a light rain	was falling.	6.452095765231624
1455. mr gross your report says that 'our	function is investigative and advisory and does not in any way derogate	from or prejudice mr bang-jensen's rights as a staff member'.	4.0908870766902545
1456. you know bang-jensen characterized your committee as having prejudged	his case.	7.748348148418885
1457. gross swung his swivel chair.	6.094118058689911
1458. well	how could that have been?	8.18656221502958
1459.  i don't consider that he was prejudged.	7.1646305411905695
1460. we were given a job and we carried it out and later his case was taken	up by the disciplinary committee h.	5.950692165236619
1461. we have nothing	to hide under a bushel.	6.499152268376671
1462. we did our job mr stavropoulos and mr	de seynes and myself taking evidence from a number of people.	6.573348512348123
1463. what did you think about his mental state?	5.8551216990437265
1464.    i	think our report sums up our finding gross answered.	6.522871687113793
1465. don't	forget here was a man who had been accusing his colleagues for almost	a year of willfully attempting to present an incorrect report h.	4.850112990662779
1466. this was not merely alleging errors but was carried out	by day-after-day allegations in memos written charges of serious consequence	h.	6.330211219515237
1467. this is a distressing thing.	8.155724806725317
1468. supposing you or	i were being accused in this manner and yet we were doing our level	best to carry on our work.	5.576974521802042
1469. no organization can carry on like that.	6.039439933523581
1470. i've been in government and i can tell some pretty hairy	stories	about personnel difficulties so i know what a problem he was.	5.154339637026587
1471. what i'd like you to comment on is the criticism leveled	at your committee.	4.8540391175834205
1472. what do you mean?	13.384913465890723
1473. 	for instance regarding the fact that the gross committee issued	two interim announcements to the press during its investigation.	4.787292514326147
1474. you	know bang-jensen was told the committee was 'to convey its views	suggestions and recommendations to the secretary general'.	5.497320487044358
1475. in his	own words bang-jensen 'took it for granted that the group would	report to the secretary general privately and not in public'.	4.556900751891871
1476. he	claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was 'prejudicial	to his position'.	6.1461867820533
1477. for an instant he	glared speechless at marshall.	6.761130517053391
1478. i thought	the entire report was going to be confidential from beginning to end.	7.57812071803448
1479. but you know bang-jensen launched an active campaign against us in	the press.	5.117503107579755
1480. it was getting so that we the committee were being tried.	7.377384752572127
1481. you can find it in the papers.	8.367578995899027
1482. well as a matter of	fact i've looked through back-issue files of new york papers for	december 1957 and haven't found a great deal-   gross	shot another look at marshall.	6.2569741502710166
1483. it wasn't necessarily all here	in new york.	6.154768904979509
1484. don't forget the foreign press.	8.321007412107924
1485. then	what about the second interim public announcement?	5.3285636594893
1486.  this cited bang-jensen's	'aberrant conduct'.	9.376157588833626
1487. the reason for that	report was to settle the matter of the list.	5.365691701076806
1488. as far as i'm concerned	it was a separate matter from the general committee study of bang-jensen's	conduct.	6.669956777352145
1489. the january fifteen report recommended that	bang-jensen be instructed to burn the list- the papers- in the presence	of a un security officer.	3.6353787693665094
1490. how about your	press conference three days later- what was the reason for that?	7.366559114071058
1491. 	bang-jensen said you told correspondents that you had checked in advance	to make sure the term 'aberrant conduct' was not libelous.	3.841511969386553
1492. he claimed you made other slanderous allegations.	7.476141753554903
1493. gross paused	and repeated himself.	6.683325264329536
1494. the entire object of the press conference	was to clarify the problem of the list since many in the press were	querying the un about it.	5.765343940979371
1495. what was the list?	9.86839126079974
1496.  i don't know.	11.747932107609333
1497. bang-jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that	he had in his possession.	4.21292691591616
1498. it was foolish of him to keep	them whatever they were.	6.9884745100224945
1499. he could have been blackmailed or his family	might have been threatened.	6.29790113304689
1500. of course the matter caught the public's	attention.	9.56871527869628
1501. we attempted to conclude this and did so by having	the papers burned.	4.765663141943135
1502. hammerskjold didn't like the way it was	carried out.	7.359448155184428
1503. it was a sort of go^tterda^mmerung affair.	8.155123921439829
1504. hammarskjold	believes the un is an organization that settles matters	in a procedural way h.	6.039958096915346
1505. if hammarskjold	had not wanted the list disposed of in this manner and if	bang-jensen had not wanted it- who had ordered it?	4.296853310816818
1506.    mr	gross concerning the formation of your committee there's the	fact that you have been a legal adviser to the un in the past;	as i understand it mr hammarskjold wanted outside advice.	5.735976264103206
1507. could you comment on that?	7.062622490332837
1508.    i've served as a counsel	for the un for some years specializing particularly in real	estate matters or other problems that the regular un legal	staff might not be equipped to handle.	5.101964573793115
1509. mr stavropoulos is the un	legal chief and a very good man but he is not fully versed on	some technical points of american law.	4.544289944817409
1510. what did you think	about bang-jensen's contention of errors and omissions in the	hungarian report?	6.405115147093153
1511.  marshall asked.	8.815314306294878
1512. why mick shann went over and over the report with alsing	andersen trying to check them out.	6.321053255952756
1513. even after the incident between	bang-jensen and shann in the delegates' lounge h and this	was not the way the chicago tribune presented it.	4.343839665202401
1514. gross	reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings.	6.289010577019261
1515. one	was an article on the un by alice widener from the cincinnati	enquirer.	4.411891185517149
1516. the other was by chesly manley in the chicago	daily tribune.	6.493992437518121
1517. gross pointed to the manley story.	5.991408784245929
1518. i	know ches he's a friend of mine.	7.1581511048922275
1519. he probably didn't mean to write	it this way or maybe he did.	4.545718103129052
1520. there wasn't any 'violent argument'	between bang-jensen and shann as the tribune puts it.	6.678840080597852
1521. that	implies that shann was on the enemy side.	6.0273910646430515
1522. you see what i mean?	10.41673404048442
1523. 	how it's phrased there- the word 'violent'.	5.3285636594893
1524. the	case was that bang-jensen came up to shann claiming he had found further	errors in the report.	6.150186255815285
1525. 'i've found errors and i want you to	look them over'.	4.681571082223364
1526. so once again shann had to argue with him about	this.	6.986401669357007
1527. but it wasn't a violent discussion.	7.408737183703147
1528. and after all this shann	went over all that bang-jensen had brought up.	6.655567161464254
1529. own report peter marshall reflected describes the encounter as	gross stopped briefly then went on.	4.21292691591616
1530. shann was responsible	for the report.	8.18656221502958
1531. he has felt terrible about all this.	6.431839159556837
1532. it was a good	report he did all he could to make it a good report.	7.813322038427109
1533. when i speak	of how shann felt i know well.	5.957395349209523
1534. don't forget i am an old member	of the club a former delegate.	5.981289363743106
1535. i think you are being unfair to take	these things up now.	5.945361408085705
1536. you know this hits in many areas.	9.335639292297357
1537. it	appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the hungarian	situation.	5.671998121358239
1538. don't forget the un did no more than the united	states did h it takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to	get the impact of this fact.	6.657035963909022
1539. from the home	of his friend henrik kauffmann in washington dc paul	bang-jensen sent a telegram dated december 9 1957 to ernest gross.	4.174789344027666
1540. it said in part:   h the matters to be considered are	obviously of a grave character and i therefore respectfully request	that the hearing be postponed for two weeks in order that i might make	adequate preparation.	5.1169917898831745
1541. ernest gross replied the next day	putting the suspended diplomat's fears to rest.	4.411891185517149
1542. this reveals some	misunderstanding on your part.	7.872441762333743
1543. the group conducting the review is	not holding formal hearings.	4.700315086579668
1544. it wished to pursue in the course of this	review questions arising from the body of material already in its	possession h.	6.513490333666505
1545. it sounded like a fair enough invitation	peter marshall reflected and bang-jensen must have thought so too	because on the thirteenth he met the group of three on the thirty-sixth	floor of the un.	3.919002202148415
1546. there ernest gross further assured him:	we were requested by the secretary general as i understand	it to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant	and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee	in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the secretariat.	5.088624114608395
1547. the only rules which i think we shall follow will be those	of common sense justice and fairness.	4.499418886048254
1548. peter marshall	noted that bang-jensen had later referred to his two interviews with	the gross group as unfortunate experiences and after his second	meeting on the sixteenth the dane refused to attend further hearings	without legal counsel.	4.801498583440173
1549. marshall pondered the reason for this and	pondered too the replacement of one member of the three-man group.	5.104704385459942
1550. j a c robertson after serving gross one week left	for england.	6.3700564631063825
1551. fortunately the hole was found at last and plugged.	5.43969834280557
1552. another week passed	and even the missionaries were enjoying the voyage.	6.774091695095158
1553. the sickness	was gone and after all the two young couples were on their honeymoon.	4.19474606914296
1554. the only lasting difficulty was the food.	7.6430158749713115
1555. in spite of pickering	dodge's explicit instructions regarding variation of meals the	food did not seem the same as at home.	4.733229921714279
1556. everything tasted differently	from what it does on land and those things i was most fond of at	home i loathed the most here ann noted.	5.215903694335216
1557. at last they concluded	that the heavy full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise.	4.643207168794281
1558. walking was the remedy they decided but a deck full of chicken	coops and pigpens was hardly suitable.	5.402966832360922
1559. a rope was found and like children in school the missionaries	skipped for hours at a time.	4.032285002619357
1560. finally tiring of so monotonous a form	of exercise they decided to dance instead.	6.5366947688032875
1561. it was much more fun reminding	the girls of their old carefree days in the hasseltine frolics	room at bradford.	4.3259609592133
1562. the weather turned warmer and with it came better	appetites although harriet was still a little off-color.	5.737296352872911
1563. she could	not face coffee or tea without milk and was always craving types of	food that were not available aboard a sailing ship.	3.9308177323121423
1564. by now she was sure	she was going to have a baby deciding it would be born in india	or burma that november.	7.288827147905778
1565. she was more excited than frightened at the	prospect of having her first child in a foreign land.	4.437317828489077
1566. the crew	of the caravan never failed to amaze ann who during her stay	in salem must frequently have overheard strong sailorly language.	4.910242167869515
1567. she	wrote in her journal i have not heard the least profane language	since i have been on board the vessel.	4.375168071659337
1568. she was now enjoying the voyage very much.	8.17487988699699
1569. even the first wave	of homesickness had passed although there were moments when captain	heard pointed out on his compass the direction of bradford that she	felt a little twinge at her heart.	4.12270723206257
1570. as for adoniram she found him	to be the kindest of husbands.	7.234051238393506
1571. on sundays with the permission	of captain heard who usually attended with two of his officers	services were held in the double cabin.	4.737477099471162
1572. sometimes a ship would be	sighted and the caravan pass so close that people could easily	be seen on the distant deck.	5.640705943328059
1573. captain heard did not communicate with	any strange vessels because of the possibility of war between the united	states and britain.	5.163113235072127
1574. as warmer temperatures were encountered ann	and harriet were introduced to the pleasures of bathing daily in salt	water.	6.049945095567984
1575. when may came the caravan had already crossed	the equator.	5.438760090171104
1576. they were sailing round the cape of good hope; the	weather had turned wet and cold.	6.134205870735891
1577. at this time harriet wrote in a letter	which after their finally landing in india was sent to her mother:	i care not how soon we reach calcutta and are placed	in a still room with a bowl of milk and a loaf of indian bread.	3.832664094897076
1578. i	can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming oh what a luxury.	5.7836982265615156
1579. i have been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel and	the almost intolerable smell after the rain that i have done little	more than lounge on the bed for several days.	3.944397254149978
1580. but i have been blest	with excellent spirits and to-day have been running about the deck	and dancing in our room for exercise as well as ever.	6.574674533825539
1581. while studying at the seminary in andover adoniram had been working	on a new testament translation from the original greek.	4.339282356674641
1582. he	had brought it along to continue during the voyage.	6.584679545078271
1583. there was one particular	word that troubled his conscience.	6.253766721067867
1584. this was the greek word most	often translated as baptism.	8.27215154902096
1585. born a congregationalist	he had been baptized as a tiny baby in the usual manner by having	a few drops of water sprinkled on his head yet nowhere in the whole of	the new testament could he find a description of anybody being baptized	by sprinkling.	3.7377580505935377
1586. john the baptist used total immersion in the river	jordan for believers; even christ was baptized by this method.	5.6490622009214375
1587. the more adoniram	looked at the greek word for baptism the more unhappy	he became over its true meaning.	3.9614086128314496
1588. as was only natural he	confided his searchings to ann conceding ruefully that it certainly	looked as if their own	congregationalists were wrong and the baptists right.	5.36851607663237
1589. by this time she had learned that	it was futile to argue with her young husband yet the uncomfortable	fact remained: the american congregationalists were sending them as	missionaries to the far east and paying their salaries.	3.9061392049458386
1590. what would	happen if adoniram changed horses in midstream?	7.739422420849732
1591.  baptists and	congregationalists in new england were on friendly terms.	5.262825482853273
1592. how embarrassing	it would be if the newly appointed congregationalist missionaries	should suddenly switch their own beliefs in order to embrace baptist	teachings!   if you become a baptist i will not	ann informed her husband but sweeping her threat aside adoniram	continued to search for an answer to the personal dilemma in which he	found himself.	4.930890110930649
1593. by early june they were a hundred miles off the	coast of ceylon by which time all four missionaries were hardened	seafarers.	4.141614542285641
1594. even harriet could boldly write i know not how it is;	but i hear the thunder roll; see the lightning flash; and the	waves threatening to swallow up the vessel; and yet remain unmoved.	5.007500482647543
1595. ann thrilled to the sight of a delicate butterfly and two	strange tropical birds.	4.305414028832856
1596. land was near and on june 12 one hundred	and fourteen days after leaving america they actually saw twenty miles	away the coast of orissa.	5.0375226425757775
1597. captain heard gave orders for	the ship to be anchored in the bay of bengal until he could obtain	the services of a reputable pilot to steer her through the shallow waters.	3.64063521251356
1598. sometimes ships waited for days for such a man but captain	heard was lucky.	7.570264436117662
1599. next day a ship arrived with an english pilot	his leadsman an english youth and the first hindu the judsons and	newells had ever seen.	4.2808062010415595
1600. a little man with a a dark copper color	skin he was wearing calico trousers and a white cotton short gown.	5.826812993545751
1601. ann was plainly disappointed in his appearance.	5.3285636594893
1602. he looks	as feminine as you can imagine she decided.	7.772339966612537
1603. the pilot possessed	excellent skill at his calling; all day long the caravan	slowly made her way through the difficult passages.	3.6965464264052694
1604. alas to ann's	consternation his language while thus employed left much to be desired.	6.156873074119021
1605. he swore so loudly at the top of his voice that she didn't get	any sleep all the next night.	4.651270129155402
1606. next morning the caravan was	out of the treacherous bay.	7.404043297047888
1607. relieved of the major part of his responsibility	for the safety of the ship the pilot's oaths became fewer.	4.826386462564451
1608. slowly she moved up the hooghli river a mouth of the mighty ganges	toward calcutta.	6.1475403961543975
1609. ann was entranced with the view as	were her husband and friends.	4.823133223497581
1610. running across the deck which was empty	now that the livestock had been killed and eaten they sniffed the spice-laden	breezes that came from the shore each pointing out new and	exciting wonders to the other.	5.085777807981485
1611. out came the journal and in it	went ann's own description of the scene:   on each side	of the hoogli where we are now sailing are the hindoo cottages as	thick together as the houses in our seaports.	3.9566821909116077
1612. they are very small	and in the form of haystacks without either chimney or windows.	7.120353304132096
1613. they	are situated in the midst of trees which hang over them and appear	truly romantick.	4.859795069501017
1614. the grass and fields of rice are perfectly green and	herds of cattle are everywhere feeding on the banks of the river and	the natives are scattered about differently employed.	4.806374889301396
1615. some are fishing	some driving the team and many are sitting indolently on the banks	of the river.	4.535375575278742
1616. the pagodas we have passed are much larger than the	houses.	5.827440601910497
1617. harriet was just as delighted.	6.094118058689911
1618. where were the hardships	she had expected?	9.081178277207362
1619.  she was certain now that it would be no harder	to bear her child here in such pleasant surroundings than at home	in the big white house in haverhill.	4.734203076363556
1620. with childlike innocence she wrote	of the indians as walking with fruit and umbrellas in their hands	with the tawny children around them h.	5.367047454796592
1621. this is the most delightful	trial i have ever had she decided.	6.81507352133518
1622. the indians	who came aboard ship to collect the mail also interested her greatly	even if she was suitably shocked according to the customs of the society	in which she had been reared to find them naked except a piece	of cotton cloth wrapped around their middle.	4.918323828187354
1623. at last they	saw calcutta largest city of bengal and the caravan's destination.	5.185159997837565
1624. founded august 24 1690 by job charnock of the east india	company and commonly called the city of palaces it seemed	a vast and elegant place to ann hasseltine judson.	5.4774947943814185
1625. solid brick	buildings painted dazzling white large domes and tall picturesque palms	stretched as far as the eye could see while the wharves and harbor	were filled with tall-masted sailing ships.	3.9682441607724437
1626. crowds flocked through the waterfront streets chattering loudly in their	strange-sounding bengali tongue.	5.926734816808145
1627. harriet's mouth watered	with anticipation when after months of dreaming she sat down at last	to her much-craved milk and fresh bread.	3.923292235882769
1628. ann pleased to see her friend	happy was intrigued by the new fruits a friend of captain heard	had sent on board for their enjoyment.	5.331966849683893
1629. cautiously she sampled her first	pineapple and another fruit whose taste she likened to that of a	rich pear.	4.335117564839391
1630. though she did not then know its name this strange new	fruit was a banana.	6.476146444518012
1631. the first act of adoniram and samuel	on reaching calcutta was to report at the police station a necessity	when landing in east india company territory.	4.034748391410313
1632. on the way they	tried to discover all they could about burma and they were disturbed	to find that michael symes's book had not presented an altogether	true picture.	5.7644944921787955
1633. he had failed to realize that the burmese were not really	treating him as the important visitor he considered himself.	5.218750974207075
1634. they	were in fact quietly laughing at him for their king wished to have	nothing to do with the western world.	6.105002548043837
1635. when captain john gibault	of salem had visited burma in 1793 his ship the astra had been	promptly commandeered and taken by her captors up the irrawaddy river.	3.8176453723265067
1636. although after much trouble he did manage to get it back he discovered	there was no trade to be had.	6.083810152971843
1637. all captain gibault took back	to salem were a few items for the town's east india museum.	4.667635675929035
1638. a	year later another salem ship returned from burma with a cargo of gum	lacquer which nobody wanted to buy.	5.502667012403734
1639. after that salem ships decided	to bypass unfriendly burma.	5.990806767547404
1640. the burmese appeared to have little	knowledge of british power or any idea of trade.	5.375157754858297
1641. cruel burmese governors could on the slightest whim take	a man's life.	4.60694635905655
1642. as for missionaries even if they succeeded in getting	into the country they probably would not be allowed to preach the	christian faith to the burmans.	6.681291352573287
1643. unspeakable tortures or even execution	might well be their fate.	4.855658467968249
1644. go back to america or any	other place well-meaning friends of captain heard advised them	but put thoughts of going to burma out of your heads.	5.445582539099816
1645. somewhat	daunted the two american missionaries reached the police station	where they were questioned by a most unfriendly clerk.	3.996502389132312
1646. when he discovered	they had received from the company's court of directors	no permission to live in india coupled with the fact that they were	americans who had been sent to asia to convert the heathen he	became more belligerent than ever.	6.216341062127448
1647. they explained that they	desired only to stop in india until a ship traveling on to burma could	be found.	4.089726876004858
1648. she describes first the imaginary reaction of a foreigner puzzled by	this unseasonable exultation; he is answered by a confused	honest englishman.	5.414093725929371
1649. the reasons for the whig joy on this occasion are	found to be their expectation of regaining control of the government	their delight at the prospect of a new war their hopes of having the	tories hanged and so on.	3.9420166389265447
1650. as for the author of the englishman	mrs manley sarcastically deplores that the sole defense of the	protestant cause should be left to ridpath dick steele and	their associates with the apostles of young man's coffee-house.	5.573444074452404
1651. another controversy typical of the war between the	englishman and the examiner centered on robert	molesworth a whig leader in ireland and a member of the irish	privy council.	4.5907399578203885
1652. on december 21 the day that the irish house	of commons petitioned for removal of sir constantine phipps their	tory lord chancellor molesworth reportedly made this remark on the	defense of phipps by convocation: they that have turned the	world upside down are come hither also.	4.761637453939682
1653. upon complaints from the	lower house of convocation to the house of lords he was removed	from the privy council his remark having been represented as a blasphemous	affront to the clergy.	4.1229038023633855
1654. steele who had earlier praised molesworth	in tatler no 189 now defended him in englishman	no 46 depicting his removal as a setback to the constitution.	4.96038068518468
1655. on	the other hand molesworth was naturally assailed in the tory press.	5.299428630959499
1656. swift in the dublin edition of a preface to the bishop of sarum's	introduction indicated his feelings by including molesworth	along with toland tindal and collins in the group of those	who like burnet are engaged in attacking all convocations of the clergy.	4.831662693257647
1657. in the same way he coupled molesworth and wharton in a letter	to archbishop king and he had earlier described him as the worst	of them in some observations on the irish privy council	submitted to oxford.	4.123571065441665
1658. a month later in the publick spirit of	the whigs he used steele's defense of molesworth as evidence of	his disrespect for the clergy calling steele's position an affront	to the whole convocation of ireland.	4.865564153343978
1659. on this issue then	as on so many in these months steele and swift took rigidly opposed	points of view.	4.664346599285576
1660. in the early months of 1714 the battle	between swift and steele over the issue of the succession entered its	major phase.	6.14146030874371
1661. the preliminaries ended with the publication of steele's	crisis on january 19 and from that point on the fight proceeded	at a rapid pace.	3.771349087693314
1662. in answer to the crisis swift produced	the publick spirit of the whigs his most extensive and bitter	attack on his old friend.	6.279809831003328
1663. by this time as we shall see the tories	were already planning to punish steele for his political writing	by expelling him from the house of commons.	4.991618918410762
1664. despite his defense	of himself in the final paper of the englishman and in his speech	before the house their efforts were successful.	6.387105887621318
1665. steele lost his	seat in parliament and his personal quarrel with swift by now a public	issue thus reached its climax.	3.8880356915934375
1666. of all the whig tracts	written in support of the succession the crisis is perhaps the	most significant.	7.5989889766662415
1667. certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate.	8.9735337493466
1668. hanoverian agents assisted in promoting circulation said to have reached	40000 and if one may judge by the reaction of swift and other	government writers the work must have had considerable impact.	5.202195391338831
1669. steele's	main business here is to arouse public opinion to the immediate	danger of a stuart restoration.	4.263061882014337
1670. to this end the first and longest	section of the tract cites all the laws enacted since the revolution	to defend england against the arbitrary power of a popish prince.	5.306770610728014
1671. in his comment on these laws steele sounds all the usual notes	of current whig propaganda ranging from a criticism of the tory	peace to an attack on the dismissal of marlborough; but his principal	theme is that the intrigues of the tories our popish or jacobite	party pose an immediate threat to church and state.	3.6343350816168427
1672. like	burnet he deplores the indifference of the people in the face of the	crisis.	8.849486591733093
1673. treasonable books striking at the hanoverian succession	he complains are allowed to pass unnoticed.	4.596163306967573
1674. in this connection swift	too is drawn in for attack: the author of the conduct of	the allies has dared to drop insinuations about altering the succession.	5.7292846344499875
1675. in his effort to stir the public from its lethargy steele	goes so far as to list catholic atrocities of the sort to be expected	in the event of a stuart restoration and with rousing rhetoric he	asserts that the only preservation from these terrours is to	be	found in the laws he has so tediously cited.	3.7168433173596234
1676. it is no time he	writes to talk with hints and innuendos but openly and honestly	to profess our sentiments before our enemies have compleated and put	their designs in execution against us.	5.317973757713557
1677. steele apparently	professed his sentiments in this book too openly and honestly for his	own good since the government was soon to use it as evidence against	him in his trial before the house.	3.808666726382772
1678. in the final issues of the englishman	which ended just as the new session of parliament began	he provided his enemies with still more ammunition.	6.050824684468725
1679. for example no	56 printed the patent giving the electoral prince the title of duke	of cambridge.	4.942690526491434
1680. in a few months the duke was to be the center of	a controversy of some significance on the touchy question of the protestant	succession.	7.473258865289739
1681. at the order of the dowager electress the hanoverian	agents supported by the whig leaders demanded that a writ	of summons be issued which would call the duke to england to sit in	parliament thus further insuring the succession by establishing a hanoverian	prince in england before the queen's death.	3.6704571744891474
1682. anne was	furious and bolingbroke advised that the request be refused.	6.289010577019261
1683. oxford	realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ took the opposite	view for which the queen never forgave him.	4.231716927264713
1684. accordingly the	request was granted but the elector himself who had not been consulted	by his mother rejected the proposal and recalled his agent schu^tz	whose impolitic handling of the affair had caused the hanoverian	interest to suffer and had made oxford's dismissal more likely	than ever.	4.85520050817056
1685. steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a	plan.	4.535752126583474
1686. a few days after this englishman appeared defoe reported	to oxford that steele was expected to move in parliament that the	duke be called over; defoe then commented if they could draw	that young gentleman into their measures they would show themselves	quickly for they are not asham'd to say they want onely a head	to make a beginning.	5.173899778417652
1687. the final issue of the englishman	no 57 for february 15 ran to some length and was printed	as a separate pamphlet entitled the englishman: being the close	of the paper so-called.	3.5930198444051236
1688. steele's purpose is to present a general	defense of his political writing and a resume of the themes which	had occupied him in the englishman; but there is much here also	which bears directly on his personal quarrel with swift.	5.436663491218684
1689. thus he complains	with considerable justice that the tory writers have resorted	to libel instead of answering his arguments.	4.387385792699249
1690. his birth education	and fortune he says have all been ridiculed simply because he has	spoken with the freedom of an englishman and he assures the reader that	whoever talks with me is speaking to a gentleman born.	4.932081271775474
1691. as	notable examples of this abuse he quotes passages from the examiner	that destroyer of all things and the character of richard	steele which he here attributes to swift.	3.9073436789834144
1692. though put in rather	maudlin terms steele's defense of himself has a reasonable basis.	6.462478401728433
1693. his point is simply that the tories have showered him with personal	satire despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right	to speak on political matters without affronting the prerogative of	the sovereign.	4.0833924597305
1694. he claims too that his political convictions are simply	those which are called revolution principles and which are	accepted by moderate men in both parties.	5.093576218283101
1695. the final section	of this pamphlet is of special interest in a consideration of steele's	relations with swift.	4.102361021058397
1696. it purports to be a letter from steele to	a friend at court who in miss blanchard's opinion could only be	meant as swift.	6.141234782910151
1697. steele first answers briefly the charges which his	dear old friend has made about his pamphlet on dunkirk and	his	crisis.	3.9394316778493597
1698. then he launches into an attack on the tory ministers	whom he calls the new converts; by this term he means to ridicule	their professions of acting in the interest of the church despite	their own education and manner of life- a gibe in other words	at the presbyterianism in harley's family and at bolingbroke's	reputed impiety.	5.259775261862197
1699. the tory leaders he insinuates are cynically	using the church as a political by-word to increase party friction	and keep themselves in power.	3.6230450572704735
1700. this is the principal point made	in this final section of englishman no 57 and it caps steele's	efforts in his other writing of these months to counteract the	notion of the tories as a church party supported by the body	of the clergy.	5.081578224379258
1701. next steele turns his attention to the courtier	he is addressing.	5.843374388272418
1702. he explains that there are sometimes honorable	courtiers but that too often a man who succeeds at court does not	hesitate to sacrifice his sovereign and nation to his own avarice	and ambition.	5.9399657279462765
1703. such he implies is the case with his friend who is not	really a new convert himself but merely a favorer of new converts.	4.050654044829422
1704. if jack the courtier is really to be taken as swift the following	remark is obviously steele's comment on swift's change of	parties and its effect on their friendship: i assure you dear	jack when i first found out such an allay in you as makes you	of so malleable a constitution that you may be worked into any form	an artificer pleases i foresaw i should not enjoy your favour much	longer.	4.665001029633766
1705. he closes his letter by demanding that dunkirk	be demolished that the pretender be forced to move farther away from	the coast of england and that the queen and the house of hanover	come to a better understanding.	4.0361986464968185
1706. the last point was soon to be included	in the seditious remarks used against him in parliament.	5.555155372103709
1707. the examiner during steele's trial a month later printed	an answer from the courtier addressed to r s at	button's coffee-house.	3.667725176716267
1708. he reviews steele's entrance into politics	and finds that his present difficulties are due to his habit of attributing	to his own abilities and talents achievements which more properly	should be credited to the indulgence of his friends.	4.696441601979777
1709. once more	in other words steele is said to be indebted to swift for his wit;	this was the form in which their private feud most often appeared	in the tory press especially the examiner.	4.047110666880423
1710. in the publick	spirit of the whigs it may be noted swift himself contemptuously	dismissed steele's reference to his friend at court: i	suppose by the style of old friend and the like it must be some	body there of his own level; among whom his party have indeed	more friends than i could wish.	5.276981013119211
1711. on february 16	steele took his seat in parliament.	5.906871049997006
1712. by now he was undergoing a fresh	torrent of abuse from tory papers and pamphlets and action was being	taken to effect his punishment by expulsion from parliament.	5.097971927471258
1713. on the	very day that the parliamentary session began another infamous	libel appeared entitled a letter from the facetious dr	andrew tripe at bath to the venerable nestor ironside.	4.067771978331478
1714. it is	filled with the usual personal abuse of steele especially of his physical	appearance; in the opening paragraph too steele is accused	of extreme egotism of giving himself the preference to all the learned	his contemporaries from dr sw-ft himself even down to	poet cr-spe of the customhouse.	4.968124075223141
1715. when harold arlen returned to california in the winter of 1944 it	was to take up again a collaboration with johnny mercer begun some	years before.	4.114228967219481
1716. the film they did after his return was an inconsequential	bit of nothing titled out of this world a satire on the sinatra	bobby-soxer craze.	5.218628930326353
1717. the twist lay in using bing crosby's voice	on the sound track while leading man eddie bracken mouthed the	words.	3.705157937514626
1718. if nothing else at least two good songs came out of the project	out of this world and june comes around every year.	6.542107892628996
1719. though they would produce some very memorable and lasting	songs arlen and mercer were not given strong material to work on.	4.231150631990284
1720. their first collaboration came close.	9.218456287398336
1721. early in 1941 they were assigned	to a script titled hot nocturne.	5.1291364932589305
1722. it purported to be a reasonably	serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians their aims their	problems- the tug-of-war between the pure and the commercial-	and seemed a promising vehicle for the two men shared a	common interest in jazz.	5.413870562562185
1723. johnny mercer practically grew up with	the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears.	4.275006671028585
1724. he was born in savannah	georgia in 1909.	10.172937999032692
1725. his father george a mercer was descended	from an honored southern family that could trace its ancestry back	to one hugh mercer who had emigrated from scotland in 1747.	3.782376506129172
1726. the lyricist's father was a lawyer who had branched out into	real estate.	5.390500575037483
1727. his second wife lillian was the mother of john h	mercer.	5.4447747927814945
1728. by the age of six young johnny indicated that he had the	call.	9.155243021384505
1729. one day he followed the irish jasper greens the town band	to a picnic and spent the entire day listening while his family spent	the day looking.	4.071462272582348
1730. the disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time	maid to keeping an eye on the boy.	5.492636744399149
1731. but one afternoon mrs	mercer met her; both were obviously on the way to the mercer home.	5.64167007047096
1732. the mother inquired where's johnny and why did you leave him?	5.850887935155896
1733. 	there was nothing else i could do the maid answered	satisfied with a rather vague explanation.	4.362106748707132
1734. but mrs mercer demanded	more.	10.094393053875976
1735. the maid then told her because he fired me.	4.320699760725407
1736. with	her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little	else but get him started on the study of music- though she waited	until he was ten- beginning with the piano and following that with	the trumpet.	4.924966487281837
1737. young mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for	both instruments.	5.011674284212689
1738. still he did like music making and even sang in	the chapel choir of the woodberry forest school near orange virginia	where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well.	5.120481296713317
1739. when he was fifteen john h mercer turned out his first song a	jazzy little thing he called sister susie strut your	stuff.	4.482204824880997
1740. if his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have	been mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with	a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect.	5.734593804561696
1741. from his playmates in savannah	mercer had picked up along with a soft southern dialect traces	also of the gullah dialects of africa.	4.618943360371071
1742. such speech differences	made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language.	7.3561121559987015
1743. during the summers while he was still in school mercer worked	for his father's firm as a messenger boy.	5.04504094255698
1744. it generally took well	into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer's help.	6.0336400218934
1745. we'd	give him things to deliver letters checks deeds and things	like that remembers his half-brother walter still in the real estate	business in savannah and learn days later that he'd absent-mindedly	stuffed them into his pocket.	3.663600538631548
1746. this rather detached attitude toward life's encumbrances has seemed	to be the dominant trait in mercer's personality ever since.	5.376204325152083
1747. it	is however a disarming disguise or perhaps a shield for not only has	mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the	years but also one who can function remarkably under pressure.	4.219342671065712
1748. he	has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer	and is a sharp businessman.	5.821243801797533
1749. he has also	an extraordinary conscience.	7.67121921529829
1750. in 1927 his father's business collapsed	and rather than go bankrupt mercer senior turned his firm over	to a bank for liquidation.	5.446297021485777
1751. he died before he could completely pay off	his debts.	5.65547855897924
1752. some years later the bank handling the mercer liquidation	received a check for $300000 enough to clear up the debt.	5.828967507072245
1753. the check	had been mailed from chicago the envelope bore no return address	and the check was not signed.	3.7179193381860367
1754. that's johnny sighed	the bank president the best-hearted boy in the world but absent-minded.	7.096498491289341
1755. but mercer's explanation was simple: i made out	the check and carried it around a few days unsigned- in case i lost	it.	4.245350768002785
1756. when he remembered that he might have not signed the check	mercer made out another for the same amount instructing the bank to	destroy the other- especially if he had happened to have absent-mindedly	signed both of them.	5.860493768749475
1757. when the family business failed mercer	left school and on his mother's urging- for she hoped that he	would become an actor- he joined a local little theater group.	4.000698321649407
1758. when	the troupe traveled to new york to participate in a one-act-play competition-	and won- mercer instead of returning with the rest of	the company in triumph remained in new york.	5.664134639181768
1759. he had talked one other	member of the group to stay with him but that friend had tired of	not eating regularly and returned to savannah.	4.16054862214413
1760. but mercer hung on	living after a fashion in a greenwich village fourth-flight walk-up.	6.215934785379358
1761. the place had no sink or washbasin only a bathtub his mother	discovered when she visited him.	3.9385914137816576
1762. johnny insisted on cooking a	chicken dinner in my honor- he's always been a good cook- and i'll	never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub.	5.0309697221948335
1763. a story	no doubt apocryphal for mercer himself denies it has him sporting	a monacle in those village days.	3.970296342830025
1764. though merely clear glass it	was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint	himself upon the memories of producers.	5.431932747540009
1765. one day in a bar so the legend	goes someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monacle	and broke it.	4.323490512149937
1766. the innocent malfeasant filled with that supreme sense	of honor found in bars insisted upon replacing the destroyed monacle-	and did over the protests of the former owner- with a square monacle.	4.6701850388672534
1767. mercer is supposed to have refused it with anyone who wears	a square monacle must be affected!   everett miller then	assistant director for the garrick gaieties a theatre guild	production needed a lyricist for a song he had written; he just	happened not to need any actor at the moment however.	3.6471401901217546
1768. for him mercer	produced the lyric to out of breath scared to death of you	introduced in that most successful of all the gaieties by sterling	holloway.	5.703941546258834
1769. this 1930 edition also had songs in it by vernon duke	and ira gershwin by e y harburg and duke and by harry	myers.	3.8110967500434594
1770. entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged	the burgeoning song writer to take a wife elizabeth meehan a dancer	in the gaieties.	5.421054271209871
1771. the mercers took up residence in brooklyn	and mercer found a regular job in wall street misplacing stocks	and bonds.	3.7453998022046284
1772. when he heard that paul whiteman was looking	for singers to replace the rhythm boys mercer applied and got the	job not for my voice i'm sure but because i could write songs	and material generally.	5.212103711736945
1773. while with the whiteman band mercer met	jerry arlen.	5.688451255343937
1774. he had yet to meet harold arlen for although they	had collaborated on satan's li'l lamb mercer and	harburg had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them.	5.143602080180852
1775. the lyric mercer remembers was tailored to fit the unusual melody.	4.300486583092194
1776. mercer's whiteman association brought him into contact	with	hoagy carmichael whose snowball mercer relyriced as lazybones	in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning	of mercer's song-writing career.	4.869557185706496
1777. after leaving whiteman mercer	joined the benny goodman band as a vocalist.	5.019675817828634
1778. with the help of ziggy	elman also in the band he transformed a traditional jewish melody	into a popular song and the angels sing.	6.17356231710168
1779. the countrywide	success of lazybones and and the angels sing could only	lead to hollywood where besides harold arlen mercer collaborated	with harry warren jimmy van heusen richard whiting walter	donaldson jerome kern and arthur schwartz.	3.3582682992635013
1780. mercer has also	written both music and lyrics for several songs.	6.61739161483436
1781. he may be the only	song writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the u s	treasury; he collaborated on a song with william hartman woodin	who was secretary of the treasury 1932-33.	4.807765557266973
1782. when johnny	mercer and harold arlen began their collaboration in 1940 mercer	like arlen had several substantial film songs to his credit among	them hooray for hollywood ride tenderfoot ride	have you got any castles baby?	4.902262028234713
1783.  and too marvelous	for words; with harry warren he	did the girl friend of the whirling dervish jeepers creepers	and you must have been a beautiful baby.	4.351896131277233
1784. mercer's	lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances	a puckish sense of humor expressed in language with a colloquial flair.	5.3925623172918495
1785. though versatile and capable of turning out a ballad lyric with	the best of them mercer's forte is a highly polished quasi-folk wit.	4.043558038269066
1786. his casual dreamlike working methods often as not in absentia	were an abrupt change from harburg's so that arlen had	to adjust again to another approach to collaboration.	5.333012853924684
1787. there were times	that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously.	5.87113357748251
1788. speaking	of his work with johnny mercer arlen says our working habits	were strange.	5.926734816808145

1795. some guys bothered me	mercer has said.	6.293668596807881
1796. i couldn't write with them in the same room with	me but i could with harold.	7.440795644426183
1797. he is probably our most original composer;	he often uses very odd rhythms which makes it difficult and	challenging for the lyric writer.	4.230652600240654

1800. besides	doing a single song when the sun comes out they worked on	the ambitious americanegro suite for voices and piano as well	as songs for films.	5.0819826375384745
1801. the americanegro suite is in a sense	an extension of the cotton club songs in that it is a collection	of negro songs not for a night club but for the concert stage.	4.752280722509695
1802. the	work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar musical strain to which	koehler set the words there'll be no more work there'll	be no	more worry matching the spiritual feeling of the jot.	5.081405512835101

1804. by september 1940 the suite	had developed into a collection of six songs four spirituals a	dream and a lullaby.	6.117942626878941
1805. the negro composer hall johnson studied	the americanegro suite and said of it of all the many	songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a negroid	idiom in both words and music these six songs by harold arlen	and ted koehler easily stand far out above the rest.	3.538368011029809
1806. thoroughly	modern in treatment they are at the same time full of simple sincerity	which invariably characterizes genuine negro folk-music and are by	no means to be confused with the average 'broadway spirituals'	which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the 'amen	corner' 'judgement day' 'gabriel's horn' and a	frustrated devil- with a few random 'hallelujahs' thrown in for	good measure.	4.876363879953527
1807. i feel obliged to describe this cubbyhole.	6.592675001897885

1809. it was	here that the terror-stricken dennis moon played an unrehearsed role	during the children's party.	4.600875209016058
1810. a much larger room adjacent to the	lavatory served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet.	6.197028602157775
1811. that	unused room was large enough for- well say an elephant could get	into it h and as a matter of fact an elephant did h   something	occurred on the morning of the children's party which may	illustrate the kind of trouble our restricted toilet facilities caused	us.	4.082076158105711

1816. he arrived on crutches at the	newspaper club with one of his great pals oliver herford artist	author and foe of stupidity.	6.245196808196708
1817. mr herford's appearance was that	of a frustrated gnome.	5.517428519734371
1818. he seemed timid wore nose glasses	from which a black ribbon dangled and was no bigger than a jockey.	5.654012528542802
1819. robinson asked herford to escort him to the club's lavatory before	they sat down for a highball and a game of cards.	4.227163332392016

1821. he had barely assumed his stance there	when a fat fellow charged through the doorway.	4.736875400492903
1822. without any regard for	rest-room protocol the hulking stranger almost knocked herford off	his pins.	6.449811959192468
1823. the artist-author said nothing but stood to one side.	4.320730508808147
1824. he	waited a long time.	8.978076491592427
1825. nothing was said nothing accomplished.	7.125240589051627
1826. the unrelieved	stranger eventually turned away from the place of his- shall	we dare say his waterloo?	5.902533934904691
1827. - to go to the door.	7.681076276828683
1828. mr herford	touched the fat man's arm.	8.42215760917367
1829. may i say that	you have just demonstrated the truth of an old proverb- the younger	pliny's if memory serves me- which translated freely from the	archaic latin says 'the more haste the less peed'.	3.5216834993071346
1830. governor alfred e smith was the official host at the children's	party.	6.796980920132091
1831. united states senator royal s copeland was wearing	the robes of santa claus and a great white beard; the honorable	robert wagner sr at that time a justice of the new york supreme	court was on the reception committee.	4.279347325321038
1832. i was in charge of the	arrangements- which were soon enough disarranged.	8.027930853216652
1833. i had had	difficulties from the very first day.	6.64818318519327
1834. when in my enthusiasm i proposed	the party my city editor	tried to block my participation in the gala event.	6.040144302319933

1836. city editor victor watson of the	new york american was a man of brooding suspicions and mysterious	shifts of mood.	6.266896444586601
1837. mr hearst's telegraphic code word for victor	watson was fatboy.	5.2528151860127545
1838. the staff saw in him the qualities of a	don cossack hence as mentioned before his nickname the hetman.	5.1572575819562685
1839. the hetman's physical aspects were not those of a savage	rider of the steppes.	3.93777821379478
1840. indeed he looked more like a well-fleshed	lay brother of the hospice of st bernard.	6.558143546590994
1841. nor were his manners	barbaric.	8.378075384551396
1842. he had a purring voice and poker player's immobility of features	which somehow conveyed the feeling that he knew where all the	bodies were buried.	6.01693549699977

1845. from the very	first he regarded himself as mr hearst's disciple defender and	afterward his prime minister self-ordained.	4.568030143545243
1846. it was said that	the hetman plotted to take over the entire hearst newspaper empire	one day by means of various coups: the destruction of editors who	tried to halt his course the unfrocking of publishers whose mistakes	of judgment might be magnified in secret reports to mr hearst.	5.138085262146243

1849. he also disliked	runyon for no good reason other than the fact that the demon's	talent was so marked as to put him well beyond the hetman's say-so	or his supervision.	4.468042458518833
1850. runyon for his part had a contemptuous	regard for mr watson.	6.871488460909426

1856. why'?	14.778306436938408
1857.    about the only time the hetman seemed excited	was	when one of his own pet ideas was born.	5.932201115405568
1858. then he would get to his feet	as though rising in honor of his own remarkable powers and say almost	invariably gentlemen this is an amazing story! it's bigger	than the armistice.	6.038450427668298
1859. some of the hetman's ideas	were dream-ridden vaguely imparted and at times preposterous.	5.752723789993506
1860. one	day he assigned me to lay bare a plot by the duponts to supply	munitions to a wholly fictitious revolution he said was about to occur	in cuba.	5.3150984524818945
1861. he said that his information was so secret that he would	not be able to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip.	4.935358482382813
1862. i	can tell you this much he said.	7.1581511048922275
1863. it's bigger than the armistice.	6.480988698428874
1864. i worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment	and consulted several of my own well-informed sources.	5.695612394093152
1865. then i spent	the next two days at the baseball park and at jack doyle's pool	parlors.	4.992635158078843
1866. when i returned to make my report the hetman did not remember	having sent me on the secret mission.	6.470024574895074
1867. he was busy he said in	having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation.	4.91889224261779
1868. and i was to go	to work on that odd matter.	8.050901583151978
1869. i shall tell of it later on.	6.106242754126474
1870. the	hetman had a strong liking for a story any story which was to be had	by means of much sleuthing or by roundabout methods.	5.424037950052707
1871. most of my stories	were obtained by simply seeking out the person who could give me	the facts and not as a rule by playing clever tricks.	4.616901511159835
1872. one day	i tired of following the hetman's advice of shadowing and	of the ring-around-the-rosie approach to a report that enrico caruso	had pinched a lady's hip while visiting the central park monkey	house.	5.087584094989543
1873. i explained my state of mind to artist winsor mccay and	to bugs baer.	4.747757929076934

1875. we fashioned beards put	them on and reported to the hetman at the city desk.	4.966672016501753
1876. mr	baer had an auburn beard like longfellow's.	7.1581511048922275
1877. mr mccay had on	a sort of emperor maximilian beard and mustache.	4.855576152371108
1878. as for myself i	had on an enormous black muff.	7.951486626482828
1879. this together with a derby hat	and horn-rim eyeglasses gave me the appearance of a russian nihilist.	4.438267287893116
1880. we are ready for your next mysterious assignment said	mr baer to the hetman.	6.841032426818831
1881. where to sir?	9.685616327314946
1882.    mr watson	did not have much humor in his make-up but he managed a mirthless	smile.	6.0509096379085845
1883. just then a reporter telephoned in from the bronx to give	the rewrite desk an account of a murder.	4.677353386560521
1884. the hetman told me to take	the story over the phone and to write it.	5.201929906662087
1885. while i was sitting at one	of the rewrite telephones with my derby and my great beard arthur	brisbane whizzed in with some editorial copy in his hand.	3.852257119168056
1886. he paused	for a moment to look at me then went on to the city desk to deliver	his today column.	6.8920970761727665
1887. i thought it expedient to take off my	derby my glasses and the beard; and also to change telephones.	4.425720611230223
1888. i	managed to do this by the time the great ab returned to the place	where he last had seen the fierce nihilist.	6.739284880210028
1889. he stood there staring	with disbelief at the vacant desk.	5.037117264724525
1890. then he wrinkled his huge brow	and went slowly out of the room.	8.155933918600393
1891. he had a somewhat goggle-eyed expression.	8.507042548384927
1892. he had been seeing things.	11.963361611338263
1893. the hetman's	ideas	for news stories or editorial campaigns were by no means always fruitless	or lacking in merit.	4.145420976395093
1894. he campaigned successfully for the riddance	of death avenue and also brought about the ending of pollution	of metropolitan beaches by sewage.	5.264349313818428
1895. he exposed the bucket-shop racket	with the able assistance of two excellent reporters nat ferber	and carl helm.	4.158468321280764
1896. in the conduct of these and many other campaigns the	hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his critics allowed.	6.848910895744063
1897. it seems to me now in a long backward glance that many of	the hetman's conceits and odd actions- together with his grim posture	when brandishing the hatchet in the name of mr hearst- were	keyed with the tragedy which was to close over him one day.	4.0337273111199865
1898. alone	rejected on every hand divorced and in financial trouble he leaped	from an eleventh-floor window of the abbey hotel in 1937.	5.160513208686437
1899. one	finds it difficult to pass censure on the lonely figure who waited	for days for a saving word from his zealously served idol wr	hearst.	3.8713674409788665
1900. that word was withheld when the need of it seemed the measure	of his despair.	6.663986752048514
1901. the unfinished note written in pencil upon the back	of a used envelope and addressed to the coroner makes one wonder	about many things: god forgive me for everything.	3.4998945806803023
1902. i cannot	h   much to damon runyon's amazement as well as my own	i got along splendidly with the hetman; that is until i became	an editor hence in his eyes a rival.	5.4877681032855365
1903. not long after colonel van	hamm had foisted me on the watson staff i received a salary raise	and a contract on the hetman's recommendation.	4.470112305927955
1904. during the next years	he gave me the second of the five contracts i would sign with the	hearst service.	6.153984108412797
1905. it was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to	have a contract in those days before the epidemic of syndicated columnists.	4.876729757716557
1906. i would like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement.	8.83940711792079
1907. somehow i think that watson paid more attention to me than he	otherwise might have because his foe colonel van hamm wouldn't	touch me with a ten-foot blue pencil.	3.973855563526482
1908. i remember one day when	mr hearst sent the	hetman a telegram: please find some more reporters like that	young man from denver.	5.428604222596519
1909. watson showed this wire to colonel van hamm.	5.066959048406199
1910. the colonel grunted then made a remark which might be construed	in either of two ways.	5.26994225740629
1911. don't bother to look any further.	5.66037853959279

1914. sergeant	mike donaldson congressional medal of honor soldier was	one of them.	6.289010577019261
1915. dr menas s gregory was another.	6.62184208933992
1916. i used to go	with watson to call on the eminent neurologist at his apartment to sit	among the doctor's excellent collection of statues paintings and	books and drink oriental coffee while watson seemed to thaw out and	become almost affable.	4.878998672092518
1917. there was one time however when his	face clouded and he suddenly blurted why did my brother commit	suicide?	4.507184969683103
1918.    i cannot remember dr gregory's reply if	indeed he made one.	7.179557942277411

1921. mama knew she was playing her son's favorite	pieces and feeling close to him and did not disturb her.	4.534644255015663
1922. all	the rest of the days in the white house would be shadowed by the tragic	loss even though the president tried harder than ever to make his	little dry jokes and to tease the people around him.	5.758703478081841
1923. a little	boy came to give the president his personal condolences and the president	gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be	shown in.	3.7921992640105002
1924. backstairs the maids cried a little over that and the standing	invitation was not mentioned to mrs coolidge.	5.577348689038325
1925. the	president was even more generous with the first lady than he had been	before the tragedy.	4.99134697438119

1931. mrs coolidge	spent more time in her bedroom among her doll collection.	4.887870818588152
1932. she kept	the dolls on the lincoln bed.	7.947936873063973
1933. at night when mama would turn back the	covers she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and place	them elsewhere for the night.	4.542748296030442
1934. mama always felt that the collection symbolized	mrs coolidge's wish for a little girl.	6.368897119915356
1935. among the	dolls was one that meant very much to the first lady who would pick	it up and look at it often.	5.239291234336405
1936. it had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist.	8.35932347483675

1947. to get him to pose	mrs coolidge would feed him candy so he enjoyed the portrait sessions	as well as she did.	4.403691718668059
1948. i would like to straighten out a misconception	about the dress mrs coolidge is wearing in this painting.	6.438197572540605
1949. it is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the smithsonian.	5.920541790691605
1950. people think the dress in the picture was lengthened by an artist	much later on.	6.675716290594968
1951. the dress in the painting is a	bright red with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side.	4.088127223919137
1952. there	is a long train flowing from the shoulders.	7.993292978571191
1953. mrs coolidge	gave mama this dress for me and i wore it many times.	4.760128122928201
1954. i still have	the dress and i hope to give it to the smithsonian institution	as a memento or as i more fondly hope to present it to a museum containing	articles showing the daily lives of the presidents- if i	can get it organized.	5.14443704258048
1955. but to get back to the coolidge household	mrs coolidge so obviously loved dogs that the public sent her	more dogs- calamity jane timmy and blackberry.	4.544323247591372
1956. the last two	were a red and a black chow.	6.709284104283759
1957. rob roy remained boss of all the dogs.	6.046514348923472
1958. he showed them what to do and taught them how to keep the maids around	the white house in a state of terror.	6.79697880698515
1959. the dogs would run	through the halls after him like a burst of bullets and all the maids	would run for cover.	4.161572350694127
1960. mama didn't know what to do- whether to tell	on rob roy or not- since she had the ear of mrs coolidge	more than the other maids.	5.178348835967395
1961. but she was afraid the first lady would	not understand because rob roy was a perfect angel with the first	family.	4.377715527400922
1962. every day when the president took his nap rob roy	would stretch out on the window seat near him like a perfect gentleman	and stare thoughtfully out the window or he would take a little	nap himself.	5.267932021067677
1963. he would not make a sound until the president had wakened	and left for the office; then he would bark to let everyone know	the coast was clear.	4.33855928878948
1964. his signal was for the other dogs to come running	but it was also the signal for mama and the other maids to watch	out.	5.72637115679523
1965. rob roy was self-appointed to accompany the president to	his office every morning.	4.411891185517149
1966. rob roy was well aware of the importance	of this mission and he would walk in front of the president looking	neither to the right nor to the left.	6.837578381968874
1967. at dinner lunch or breakfast	the president would call out supper!- he called	all meals supper- after the butler had announced the meal.	4.076030993843832
1968. all the	dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the president and go to	the dining room.	6.742389886681439
1969. they would all lie around on the rug during the meal	a very pretty sight as rob roy prudence and calamity jane were	all snow-white.	4.2299200090628215
1970. when prudence and blackberry were too young	to be trusted in the dining room they were tied to the radiator with	their leashes and they would cry.	5.645619045862839
1971. mama tried to talk to them and keep	them quiet while she tidied up the sitting room before the first	family returned.	4.198070213913867
1972. finally mama did mention to mrs coolidge	that she felt sorry for the little dogs and then mrs coolidge	decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone even though	her husband disapproved of the waste of electricity.	4.996856177024386
1973. mama was	now the first maid to mrs coolidge because catherine the previous	first maid had become ill and died.	3.9394316778493597
1974. mrs coolidge chose mama	in her place.	8.506321418795084
1975. it was a high mark for mama.	6.7752385171458585
1976. every first	family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship.	7.376508508511583
1977. for the coolidges it was mr and mrs frank w stearns	of boston massachusetts owners of a large department store.	4.97571919886318
1978. they	seemed to be at the white house half the time.	9.102035921155311
1979. the butlers were	amused because when the stearns were there the president would say	grace at breakfast.	3.9799535744397176
1980. if the stearns were not there grace would be omitted.	7.0862670507639045
1981. speaking of breakfast the president inaugurated a new	custom- that of conducting business at the breakfast table.	4.349357704219399
1982. the word	was that this too was part of an economy move on his part.	5.5136995260074455
1983. a new bill	had been passed under harding that designated the government rather	than the president as the tab-lifter for official meals.	4.103990804218646
1984. so the	president would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting government	officials to attend.	6.306918553087947
1985. he caused a lot of talk when he also	chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair	while he ate.	4.4684613394625865
1986. mama said that if presidents were supposed to be colorful	mr coolidge certainly made a good president.	6.092803106947488
1987. he knew exactly	how to be colorful!   the favorite guest of the house as	far as the staff was concerned was mr wrigley the chewing gum king.	4.230289999001935
1988. the white house had chewing gum until it could chew no more and	every christmas mr wrigley sent the president a check for $100	to be divided among all the help.	5.119270384202242
1989. you can imagine that he got pretty	good service.	6.334711431504584
1990. another good friend of the coolidges' was	george b harvey who was the ambassador to great britain from	1921 to 1923.	5.74360292226511
1991. he had been a friend of the hardings and continued	to be invited by the coolidges.	5.538093802314396
1992. the first royalty whom mama	ever waited on in the white house was queen marie of rumania	who came to a state dinner given in her honor on october 21 1926.	6.024666771995863
1993. she was not an overnight guest in the white house but mr ike	hoover the chief usher had mama check her fur coat when she came	in and take care of her needs.	4.471421517872328
1994. mama said she was one of the prettiest	ladies she had ever seen.	7.308531871450587
1995. mama was very patriotic and one of	the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that	flew above the white house.	3.9067827185202333
1996. actually two flags were used at the	mansion- a small one on rainy days and a big one on bright days.	5.81609398367119
1997. the wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind	and mama would mend it.	3.7179193381860367
1998. she would often go up on the roof to see	the attendant take down the flag in the evening.	6.355728057410861
1999. she used to tell me	when i stand there and look at the flag blowing this way and that	way i have the wonderful safe feeling that americans are protected	no matter which way the wind blows.	3.9502811200915673
2000. even when mrs	coolidge was in mourning for her son she reached out to help other people	in trouble.	6.164016034418041
2001. one person she helped was my brother.	6.280438744264741
2002. mama had told	her how emmett's lungs had been affected when he was gassed in the	war.	6.310181634863525
2003. he was in and out of mount alto hospital for veterans any number	of times.	5.844691535421928
2004. taking a personal interest she had the doctor	assigned to the white house dr james coupal look emmett over.	6.337191170370207
2005. as a result he was sent to a hospital in arizona until his health	improved enough for him to come back to washington to work in the	government service.	4.675205139883824
2006. but again there was danger that his lungs would	suffer in the muggy washington weather and he had to return to the	dry climate of the west to live and work.	6.564254240592506
2007. when mrs coolidge	was in mourning she did not wear black.	5.409848859835252
2008. she wore grey every day	and white every evening.	7.874402369859866
2009. mama knew that she was out of mourning when	she finally wore bright colors.	5.40300158089505
2010. the president helped her a lot by selecting	some lovely colored dresses to get her started.	5.902070660400209
2011. she opened the	boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face.	4.300814213945045
2012. on	the social side the chore mama had at the formal receptions at the	white house thrilled her the most.	5.841933931934872
2013. it was her job to stand at the	foot of the stairs and just as the first lady stepped off the last	tread mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to	the blue room to greet her guests with the president.	3.9306015648002766
2014. mama would	enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone and would note	a gown here and there to tell me about that night.	5.883099350208959
2015. one night	mama came home practically in a state of shock.	5.8887950539229115
2016. she had stood at the	bottom of the stairs as usual when mrs coolidge came down in	the same dress that is now in the smithsonian to greet her guests.	5.443749231425218
2017. mama stooped down to fix the train but there was no train there! she	reached and reached around the dress but there was nothing there.	4.425087326332708
2018. she looked up and saw that without knowing it mrs coolidge was	holding it aloft.	6.157188504566936
2019. mrs coolidge looked down saw mama's horrified	expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor.	4.355478568181915
2020. mama	swirled the train in place and not a step was lost.	6.754869013051684
2021. the coolidges	did not always live at the white house during the presidency.	4.760605745664949
2022. impressive as this enumeration is it barely hints at the diverse	perceptions of jews collectively or individually that have been	attested by their gentile environment.	5.004173005508399
2023. it is reasonable to affirm	two propositions: jews have been perceived by non-jews as all things	to all men; some jews have in fact been all things to all men.	3.719213850299798
2024. in the arena of power jews have at one time or another been somebody's	ally; they have observed correct neutrality; they have been	someone's enemy.	5.642977039585099
2025. in the market place jews have in fact under various	circumstances been valued customers and suppliers or clannish monopolists	and cutthroat competitors.	4.332458701961471
2026. and so on through the roles referred	to in the previous paragraph.	7.868598528761979
2027. diversity of perception yes; diversity	of fact yes.	5.3285636594893
2028. but the two do not invariably or even	typically coincide.	7.408599248988233
2029. the conventional image of a particular time	and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as	established over the years by scholarly and scientific research.	4.429680276733732
2030. conventional	images of jews have this in common with all perceptions of	a configuration in which one feature is held constant: images can be	both true and false.	5.184746832435755
2031. the genuinely interesting question then	becomes: what factors determine the degree of realism or distortion	in conventional images of jews?	3.9907987550274164
2032.  the working test of the facts	must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars	and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation	to relevant situations.	4.8511926235742555
2033. granted such functional images are subject	to human error; they are self-correcting in the sense that they	are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against	error.	4.0029656466882635
2034. in accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors	can be usefully distinguished: current intelligence; predispositions	regarding intelligence.	5.872973269393318
2035. general grant may have been the victim	of false information in the instance reported in this book; if so	he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed	to bad information and dubious estimates of the future.	4.118707530803081
2036. but general	grant may have been self-victimized.	10.184963047624784
2037. he may have entered the situation	with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the	press of affairs.	4.6815099336226185
2038. predispositions in turn fall conveniently	into two categories for purposes of analysis.	6.093123995732186
2039. to some extent predispositions	are shaped by exposure to group environments.	5.562037792528531
2040. in some measure	they depend upon the structure of individual personality.	7.911192314367776
2041. the anti-semitism	of hitler owed something to his exposure to the ideology of	lueger's politically successful christian socialist movement in vienna.	3.7308757087128006
2042. but millions of human beings were exposed to lueger's propaganda	and record.	6.4861208291920995
2043. after allowing for group exposures it is apparent	that other factors must be considered if we are to comprehend fanaticism.	4.729944186738155
2044. these are personality factors; they include harmonies and conflicts	within the whole man and mechanisms whereby inner components are	more or less smoothly met.	5.465892001767841
2045. modern psychiatric knowledge provides us	with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind.	4.744940263061459
2046. the foregoing factors are pertinent to the analysis of perceptual	images and the broad conditions under which they achieve realism or	fall short of it.	4.730701665605607
2047. undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of gentile	conceptions of the jew unfolded in the present anthology is that	it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination	in terms of reality.	3.8560412915705333
2048. many selections are themselves convincing	contributions to this appraisal.	7.777761794522012
2049. undoubtedly however the significance	of the volume is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest.	4.797106799978258
2050. speaking as a non-jew i believe that its primary contribution is	in the realm of future policy.	6.671751031755175
2051. since we can neither undo nor redo the	past we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow.	4.6151986905465225
2052. in this	domain the simple fact of coexistence in the same local national and	world community is enough to guarantee that we cannot refrain from having	some effect large or small upon gentile-jewish relations.	5.304988145929076
2053. what	shall these effects be?	6.683325264329536
2054.    i am deliberately raising the policy	problems involved in gentile-jewish relations.	7.288966093639867
2055. comprehensive examination	of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual	tasks inseparable from any problem-solving method.	4.288908460166186
2056. the tasks	are briefly indicated by these questions: what are my goals in gentile-jewish	relations?	5.289832921804139
2057.  what are the historical trends in this country	and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized?	4.674242106073774
2058. 	what factors condition the degree of realization at various	times and places?	6.871026785592661
2059.  what is the probable course of future developments?	6.9027385530885
2060. 	what policies if adopted and applied in various circumstances will	increase the likelihood that future events will coincide with desired	events and do so at least cost in terms of all human values?	5.123610368178047
2061. 	it is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions	of such depth and range.	4.134121792237207
2062. the discussion is therefore limited to a	suggested procedure for realizing at least some of the potential importance	of this volume for future policy.	5.326825133648288
2063. as a groundwork for the proposal	i give some attention to the first task enumerated above the clarification	of goal.	4.984739367627431
2064. my reply is that i associate myself with	all those who affirm that gentile-jewish relations should contribute	to the theory and practice of human dignity.	5.250695337495364
2065. the basic goal finds partial	expression in the universal declaration of human rights a statement	initiated and endorsed by individuals and organizations of many	religious and philosophical traditions.	3.708062179698028
2066. within this frame of	reference policies appropriate to claims advanced in the name of the	jews depend upon which jewish identity is involved as well as upon	the nature of the claim the characteristics of the claimant the justifications	proposed and the predispositions of the community decision	makers who are called upon to act.	5.503825425589501
2067. if jews are identified as a religious	body in a controversy that comes before a national or international	tribunal it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity	to protect freedom of worship.	3.844804066625432
2068. when decision makers act within this	frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion	is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion.	5.441419376275818
2069. since the recognition of israel as a nation state claims are made	in many cases which identify the claimant as a member of the new body	politic.	4.849892662884255
2070. community decision makers must make up their minds whether	a claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms of prevailing	expectations regarding members of nation states.	5.919494193581803
2071. in free countries	many controversies involve self-styled jews who use the symbol in asserting	a vaguely cultural rather than religious or political identity.	3.9869426017109824
2072. the decision maker who acts for the community as a whole must	decide whether the objectives pursued and the methods used are appropriate	to public policy regarding cultural groups.	5.0458062827482175
2073. we know that	much is made of the multiplicity and ambiguity of the identities that	cluster around the key symbol of the jew.	4.566295118150077
2074. many public and private controversies	will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusions in	the mind and usage of gentile and jew.	5.5993584695223655
2075. however in the context of legal	and civic policy these controversies are less than novel.	5.31477294299935
2076. they	involve similar uncertainties regarding the multiple identities of any	number of non-jewish groups.	5.926734816808145
2077. so far as the existing body of formal	principle and procedure is concerned categorical novelties are not	to be anticipated in jewish-gentile relationships; claims are properly	disposed of according to norms common to all parties.	4.0779518688391425
2078. it	is not implied that formal principles and procedures are so firmly entrenched	within the public order of the world community or even of free	commonwealths that they will control in all circumstances involving jews	and gentiles during coming years.	5.8335915150556845
2079. social process is always anchored	in past predisposition; but it is perennially restructured in situations	where anchors are dragged or lost.	4.526396268249482
2080. in conformance with the	maximization principle we affirm that gentile-jewish relations will	be harmonious or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or the	other is expected by the active participants to yield the greatest net	advantage taking all value outcomes and effects into consideration.	4.705060681062597
2081. it is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions	will cumulate; for instance imagine the situation if israel	ever joins an enemy coalition.	4.308432177801224
2082. the formal position of americans who	identify themselves with one or more of the several identities of the	jewish symbol is already clear; the future weight of informal factors	cannot be so easily assessed.	4.973218554447233
2083. when we consider the disorganized	state of the world community and the legacy of predispositions adversely	directed against all who are identified as jews it is obvious	that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be prosecuted	with increasing vigor and skill.	4.319774515992898
2084. during moments of intense crisis	the responsibility of political leaders is overwhelming.	7.1556662361468915
2085. but their	freedom of policy is limited by the pattern of predisposition with which	they and the people around them enter the crisis.	4.368560147866845
2086. at such critical	moments predispositions favorable to human dignity most obviously pay	off.	6.850358795941094
2087. by the same test predispositions destructive of human personality	exercise their most sinister impact with the result that men	of good will are often trapped and nullified.	4.351027859990798
2088. among measures	in anticipation of crisis are plans to inject into the turmoil as assistants	of key decision makers qualified persons who are cognizant of	the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also	able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened leaders near	the limit of self-control.	4.657437834334982
2089. we are learning how to do these things	in some of the vast organized structures of modern society; the process	can be accelerated.	4.9429847361202714
2090. a truism is that the time to prepare	for the worst is when times are best.	6.791323794328459
2091. during intercrisis periods the	educational facilities of the community have the possibility of remolding	the perspectives and altering the behavior of vast numbers of human	beings of every age and condition.	4.62242724812148
2092. as more men and women are made capable	of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved	that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength	in future crises can be favorably affected.	6.008952599486782
2093. now an abiding	difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach;	and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation	of the goodness of the good.	3.9529543673974414
2094. in any case i do not intend to	let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the	problem of implementing good intentions.	6.240324057068048
2095. i assume that the number of	readers of this anthology who regard themselves as morally perfect is	small and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which	they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding	of others.	3.90176905033461
2096. properly used the present book is an excellent instrument	of enlightenment.	6.4843701107983
2097. let us not confuse the issue by labeling	the objective or the method psychoanalytic for this is a well established	term of art for the specific ideas and procedures initiated	by sigmund freud and his followers for the study and treatment of disordered	personalities.	3.9431633518819584
2098. the traditional method proceeds by the technique	of free association punctuated by interpretations proposed by the	psychoanalytic interviewer.	5.167872444398708
2099. what we have in mind does have	something in common with the goals of psychoanalysis and with the methods	by which they are sought.	5.490665680608903
2100. for what we propose however a psychoanalyst	is not necessary even though one aim is to enable the reader to	get beneath his own defenses- his defenses of himself to himself.	4.991321155108445
2101. for this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is	necessary; but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame	of mind.	5.1147558932077475
2102. the relatively long and often colorful selections	in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in	what is said whether he responds with anger or applause.	4.673736330212827
2103. but simple	involvement is not enough; self-discovery calls for an open permissive	inquiring posture of self-observation.	4.43817859104386
2104. the symposium provides	an opportunity to confront the self with specific statements which	were made at particular times by identifiable communicators who were	addressing definite audiences- and throughout several hundred pages	everyone is talking about the same key symbol of identification.	4.8164792292046315
2105. an advantage of being exposed to such specificity about an important	and recurring feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage	of by the reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances	within himself resonances triggered by explicit symbols clustering around	the central figure of the jew.	4.201366493299476
2106. two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special	significance for our time.	6.88361738548572
2107. one a reservation on the point i have just	made is the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking pseudo-feeling and pseudo-willing	which fromm discussed in the escape from freedom.	3.9276214482441647
2108. in essence this involves grounding one's thought and emotion in the	values and experience of others rather than in one's own values	and experience.	5.6667136239346325
2109. there is a risk that instead of teaching a person how	to be himself	reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody	else.	4.27384879961485
2110. clearly what the person brings to the reading is important.	6.820488456770378
2111. moreover if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in	a work he is contributing to this pseudo-thinking; if he instructs	them in how to evaluate a work he is helping them to achieve their	own identity.	3.591557256775408
2112. the second timely part of this sketch of literature	and the search for identity has to do with the difference between	good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products	of today.	5.881820039705581
2113. in the range and variety of characters who in their	literary lives get along all right with life styles one never imagined	possible there is an implicit lesson in differentiation.	4.112083188750602
2114. the reader	observing this process might ask why not be different?	5.643027344585572
2115.  and	find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species.	5.757159324937363
2116. the observer of television or other products for a mass audience has	only a permit to be like the models he sees even more like everybody	else.	4.752961255512015
2117. and this i think holds for values as well as life styles.	6.320239997586922
2118. one would need to test this proposition carefully; after all the large	reader's digest literature on the	most unforgettable character i ever met deals with village grocers	country doctors favorite if illiterate aunts and so forth.	5.050761015304806
2119. scientists	often turn out to be idiosyncratic too.	6.839598656524753
2120. but still the proposition	is worth examination.	8.691783046607856
2121. it is possible that the study	of literature affects the conscience the morality the sensitivity to	some code of right and wrong.	4.570328097480649
2122. i do not know that this is	true; both flu^gel and ranyard west deal with the development	and nature of conscience as do such theologians as niebuhr and buber.	5.806248020734445
2123. it forms the core of many perhaps most problems of psychotherapy.	5.626389625709777
2124. i am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the	psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development	of conscience- most of their attention is to a pre-literate	period of life or for the theologians of course to the influence	of religion.	5.508298956791225
2125. still it would be surprising if what one reads did	not contribute to one's ideas of right and wrong; certainly the	awakened alarm over the comic books and the continuous concern over prurient	literature indicate some peripheral aspects of this influence.	3.8993221415581205
2126. probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development	of conscience which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature	but the contents of conscience the code which is imparted to the developed	or immature conscience available.	5.5785790772707395
2127. this is in large part a code	of behavior and a glossary of values: what is it that people do and	should do and how one should regard it.	4.357529232830472
2128. in a small way this is illustrated	by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful	influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated	this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover how to behave how	to think about this new experience how to exercise restraint.	4.778919318239416
2129. literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose dedication	mission significance.	5.8907862176370145
2130. this no doubt is part of what gilbert seldes	implies when he says of the arts they give form and meaning	to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense.	5.347397996031499
2131. men	seem almost universally to want a sense of function that is a feeling	that their existence makes a difference to someone living or unborn	close and immediate or generalized.	4.098984837561704
2132. feeling useless seems generally	to be an unpleasant sensation.	6.806723317680827
2133. a need so deeply planted asking	for direction so to speak is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples	and heroic proportions of literature.	4.343633924215569
2134. the terms renewal	and refreshed which often come up in aesthetic discussion seem	partly to derive their import from the renewal of purpose and	a refreshed sense of significance a person may receive from poetry	drama and fiction.	4.570464517237097
2135. the notion of inspiration is somehow cognate	to this feeling.	4.320730508808147
2136. how literature does this or for whom is certainly	not clear but the content form and language of the message	as well as the source would all play differentiated parts in giving	and molding a sense of purpose.	5.6660512221858355
2137. one of the most salient features	of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and	organization of emotion.	4.658271615337247
2138. let us differentiate a few of these ideas.	10.066135066546522
2139. the	aristotelian notion of catharsis the purging of emotion is a persistent	and viable one.	4.305414028832856
2140. the idea here is one of discharge but this	must stand in opposition to a second view plato's notion of the	arousal of emotion.	6.200378763720355
2141. a third idea is that artistic literature serves	to reduce emotional conflicts giving a sense of serenity and	calm to individuals.	4.512792252148817
2142. this is given some expression in beardsley's	notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision.	6.463584138484468
2143. a fourth view is	the transformation of emotion as in housman's fine phrase on the	arts: they transform and beautify our inner nature.	3.7782646401868343
2144. it is possible	that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea.	7.025421318552812
2145. fsc	northrop in his discussion of the functions and future	of poetry suggests this: one of the things which makes	our lives drab and empty and which leaves us at the end of the day	fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing practical	utilitarian concern of common-sense objects.	4.213191627324899
2146. if art is to release	us from these postulated things things we must think symbolically	about and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the	aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy it must sever its connection	with these common sense entities.	4.966920955050179
2147. i take the central meaning	here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without	literature and a life enriched by it.	4.287650279794665
2148. richards' view of the aesthetic	experience might constitute a sixth variety: for him it constitutes	in part the organization of impulses.	6.133809738584497
2149. a sketch of	the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account	of all of these.	5.544149427830608
2150. but there is one in particular which it seems	to me deserves special attention.	7.8984177674764044
2151. in the wide range of experiences	common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage more	troublesome and more enduring in its effects than the control of love	and hate.	3.9411067595606752
2152. the study of literature contributes to this control in a curious	way.	6.457778003447636
2153. william wimsatt and cleanth brooks it seems to me have	a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected:	for if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love	and if it is to talk of anger and murder	- then it may be that the poetic way of dealing	with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification compounding	or magnification or any direct assault upon the affections	at all.	4.112967206265378
2154. something indirect mixed reconciling tensional might well	be the strategem the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all	kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like expressions	of these emotions without aiming at their incitement or	even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement.	4.828255649571022
2155. the rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions	may be a most valuable human experience.	3.7635883207428518
2156. here i do not mean	catharsis the discharge of emotion.	9.356440817475711
2157. i mean something more like freud's	concept of the utility of play to a small child: he plays	house or doctor or fireman as a way of mastering	slightly frightening experiences reliving them imaginatively until they	are under control.	3.9488711948629813
2158. there is a second feature of the influences	of literature good literature on emotional life which may have	some special value for our time.	5.924910435915735
2159. in b m spinley's portrayal	of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of london a salient	finding was the inability to postpone gratification a need to satisfy	impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring	the experience.	3.617444665254568
2160. perhaps it is only an analogy but one of the most	obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring	quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation.	6.20161698344263
2161. anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature	will understand what i mean.	4.866965892518435
2162. it is at least possible that the capacity	to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in	a continuous and guided exposure to great literature.	6.5160967756389585
2163. in any	inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions particularly	with respect to the sense of harmony or relief of tension	or sense of a transformed inner nature which may occur a most	careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which	produces the effect would be required.	3.9088021700099804
2164. in the calm which follows the	reading of a poem for example is the effect produced by the enforced	quiet by the musical quality of words and rhythm by the sentiments	or sense of the poem by the associations with earlier readings if it	is familiar by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate	by	the diversion of attention by the sense of security in a legitimized	withdrawal by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded	as forbidden or by half-conscious ideas about the magical power of	words?	4.459158317288698
2165.  these are if the research is done with subtlety and skill	researchable topics but the research is missing.	4.406004655286236
2166. one of the	most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility	that it is thought to provide.	7.549112539581781
2167. sensibility is a vague word	covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent quality	or skill.	4.1705579210765285
2168. among other things it means perception discrimination sensitivity	to subtle differences.	7.9740505830284185
2169. both the extent to which this is true	and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged.	5.057847121576419
2170. its truth is illustrated by the skill sensitivity and general	expertise of the english professor with whom one attends the theatre.	5.856456100687777
2171. the limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment: contrast	the perceptual skill of english professors with that of their colleagues	in discriminating among motor cars political candidates or female	beauty.	3.5808603597751922
2172. along these lines the particular point that sensitivity	in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more	proof than i have seen.	5.336774575120823
2173. in a symposium and general exploration of	the field of person perception and interpersonal behavior the	discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject with one	possible exception; solomon asch shows the transcultural stability	of metaphors based on sensation dealing	with personal qualities of human beings and events.	3.6971671001656112
2174. but to go from here	to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will	also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential	leap.	5.562354970025835
2175. i would say too that the study of literature	tends to give a person what i shall call depth.	5.463718932194981
2176. i use this term	to mean three things: a search for the human significance of an event	or state of affairs a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts	and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling.	5.248885122899498
2177. it	is the obverse of triviality shallowness emotional anaesthesia.	5.725934057586576
2178. i	think these attributes cluster but i have no evidence.	7.872553601409643
2179. in fact i	can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide continuous and	properly guided exposure to literary art.	4.822244595149532
2180. the late r g collingwood a philosopher whose work	has proved helpful to many students of literature once wrote we	are all though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it in	far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace	than with chaucer and cimabue or even shakespeare and titian.	4.653309566732395
2181. by	an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the	art of a remote past or an alien present and enjoy the carvings of	cavemen and japanese colour-prints; but the possibility of this	effort	is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the	greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries	and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not	taken place.	3.4769414267841707
2182. the natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy	contemporary art to despise and dislike the art of the recent past	and wholly to ignore everything else.	5.359810514560108
2183. one might argue that	the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous	provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general	public of the newspaper critic and of the creative artist himself.	4.20249900945717
2184. there results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the	contemporary.	7.688553989901348
2185. such study may take many forms.	6.690201961342972
2186. the study of ideas in	literature is one of these.	8.966683843265315
2187. of course it goes without saying that no	student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene.	4.710689487179816
2188. he will	frequently return to it.	8.633224741348258
2189. the continuities contrasts and similarities	discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible	and the one is often understood through the other.	3.5473748551672966
2190. when	we assert the value of such study we find ourselves committed to	an important assumption.	6.762550231345262
2191. most students of literature whether they call	themselves scholars or critics are ready to argue that it is possible	to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them.	4.960618054136147
2192. many will	add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding.	6.766869041671294
2193. this	understanding of course may in its turn take many forms and some	of these- especially those most interesting to the student of comparative	literature- are essentially historical.	3.716601879719686
2194. but the historian of	literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic	questions of form texture or technique.	5.614134427217448
2195. he may also consider	ideas.	9.16390868278858
2196. it is true that this distinction between style and idea often	approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and	content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes	appear as expressions of the same insight.	5.6314613687046675
2197. but in general we	may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention	toward one or the other.	4.975185080860516
2198. at this point a working definition	of idea is in order although our first definition will have to	be qualified somewhat as we proceed.	5.865545734382025
2199. the term idea refers to our	more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies	of sensuous or emotional experience.	3.7141399796327943
2200. it is through such reflection	that literature approaches philosophy.	8.20839194884805
2201. an idea let us say may be	roughtly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may	be concerned.	4.069387356713819
2202. in this essay we are	along with most historians interested	in the more general or more inclusive ideas that are so to speak	writ large in history of literature where they recur continually.	5.13364181520537
2203. outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself including	the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries;	also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man the depravity	of man and the dignity of man.	4.0373596814630766
2204. one might indeed argue that the	history of ideas in so far as it includes the literatures must center	on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of	literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference	to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning.	5.283943280180769
2205. we need not to be sure expect to find such ideas in every piece of	literature.	6.056605499253134
2206. an idea of the sort that we have in mind although of	necessity readily available to imagination is more general in connotation	than most poetic or literary images especially those appearing in	lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience.	5.5496231924769255
2207. thus	burns's my love is like a red red rose and hopkins'	the thunder-purple sea-beach plumed purple of	thunder although clearly intelligible in content hardly present	ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned.	3.834271707492106
2208. on the other hand	arnold's the unplumbed salt estranging sea	taken in its context certainly does so.	6.79070996856396
2209. understanding a work	of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies.	4.867411545084113
2210. thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify	a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject	matter typical or atypical of its period.	5.091853538117182
2211. again he may discover embodied	within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere	and at other times in various ways.	4.309575173355781
2212. our understanding will very	probably require both these commentaries.	7.777703262293139
2213. very likely it will also include	a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or belongs	to some way of thought labelled as a school or an -ism	ie a complex or syndrome of ideas occurring together	with sufficient prominence to warrant identification.	3.5422531221345515
2214. thus ideas like	grace salvation and providence cluster together	in traditional christianity.	7.024699586244293
2215. usually the work studied offers us a special	or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in	question so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully	between the several expressions of an -ism or mode of thought.	4.341962126621895
2216. accordingly we may speak of the platonism peculiar to shelley's	poems or the type of stoicism present in henley's invictus	and we may find that describing such platonism or such stoicism	and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or	mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise.	5.234740149596632
2217. after all	shelley is no orthodox or hellenic platonist and even his	romantic platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries.	4.299231334387954
2218. again henley's attitude of defiance which colors his ideal	of self-mastery is far from characteristic of a stoic thinker like	marcus aurelius whose gentle acquiescence is almost christian	comparable to the patience expressed in milton's sonnet on his own	blindness.	5.009297973972139
2219. in recent years we have come increasingly to recognize	that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters	of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature	and the arts although these aspects should be studied in conjunction	with the history of philosophy of religion and of the sciences.	4.129342461765278
2220. when these fields are surveyed together important patterns of	relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence	a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions primarily	literary religious and philosophical but frequently including	contact with the fine arts and even to some extent with science.	4.955846658138159
2221. here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history	is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives	of the historian's research.	4.481378785246418
2222. let us quote once more from r g	collingwood: history is properly concerned with the actions	of human beings h regarded from the outside an action is an event	or series of events occurring in the physical world; regarded from the	inside it is the carrying into action of a certain thought h the	historian's business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions	with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts	which constituted them.	4.966790629708525
2223. it is a characteristic of thoughts that h	in re-thinking them we come ipso facto to understand why they were	thought.	4.277621140432623
2224. such an understanding although it must seek to be sympathetic	is not a matter of intuition.	7.312323725066447
2225. history has this in common	with every other science: that the historian is not allowed to claim	any single piece of knowledge except where he can justify his claim	by exhibiting to himself in the first place and secondly to any one	else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration the grounds	upon which it is based.	3.7366113943198997
2226. this is what was meant above by describing	history as inferential.	7.979718482955946
2227. the knowledge in virtue of which a man	is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves	about certain events.	4.115384440461527
2228. it is obvious that the historian who seeks	to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout	a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of	his central and major concerns by no means a mere supplement or adjunct	of significant historical research.	5.104238102675317
2229. the student of ideas and	their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of	transition which are at the same time patterns of transformation whereby	ideas pass from one area of activity to another.	4.039144951665512
2230. let us survey	for a moment the development of modern thought- turning our attention	from the reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements	that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades.	5.474566890757144
2231. we may thus	trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious	practice and theological reflection through practical politics	and political theory into literature and the arts.	3.9059617704938496
2232. finally we may note	that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is	at present widespread.	6.216063234687383
2233. no one will deny that such broad developments	and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas	in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference	to them.	4.161046903214205
2234. still we must remember that we cannot construct and justify	generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special	instances of influence moving between such areas as theology philosophy	political thought and literature.	5.45469467032761
2235. the actual moments of contact	are vitally important.	4.818733818634357
2236. these moments are historical events in the	lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative literature	must be frequently concerned.	5.9895341573789045
2237. perhaps the most powerful	and most frequently recurring literary influence on the western world	has been that of the old and new testament.	5.758477213022333
2238. certainly one of	the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural	life of any period of western civilization during the past sixteen	or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders	have read and interpreted the bible.	6.224304489067753
2239. this reading and the comments	that it evoked constitute the influence.	4.799082862291682
2240. a contrast of the scripture	reading of let us say st augustine john bunyan and thomas	jefferson all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment	can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age	that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression.	4.847317896760675
2241. in	much the same way we recognize the importance of shakespeare's familarity	with plutarch and montaigne of shelley's study of plato's	dialogues and of coleridge's enthusiastic plundering of the writings	of many philosophers and theologians from plato to schelling	and william godwin through which so many abstract ideas were brought	to the attention of english men of letters.	3.626533878543303
2242. we may also recognize	cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and	even indirectly the scientists.	6.9839771528870624
2243. english philosopher samuel alexander's	debt to wordsworth and meredith is a recent interesting example	as also a n whitehead's understanding of the english romantics	chiefly shelley and wordsworth.	4.183016699383743
2244. hegel's profound admiration	for the insights of the greek tragedians indicates a broad channel	of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy.	5.2920541105344485
2245. again the	student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating if to our minds	grotesque anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the	natural elimination of the unfit in lucretius who in turn seems to	have borrowed the concept from the philosopher empedocles.	3.6890489242853106
2246. here	an important caveat is in order.	7.603896187885215
2247. we must avoid the notion suggested	to some people by examples such as those just mentioned that ideas	are units in some way comparable to coins or counters that can	be passed intact from one group of people to another or even for that	matter from one individual to another.	3.593667004412342
2248. suppose you take mr hearst's morning american at	$10000 a year brisbane proposed.	6.420631689938835
2249. you could come down to the	office once a day look over a few exchanges dictate an editorial	and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary	labors.	4.024014492450225
2250. if within one year you can make a success out of the american	you can practically name your own salary thereafter.	6.926712265478903
2251. of course	if you don't make the american a success hearst will have	no further use for you.	4.4975498005978025
2252. the blue-eyed watson decided that	he would dislike living in new york and the deal fell through.	5.927292185348114
2253. hearst's	luck was even poorer when he had a chat with franklin k	lane a prominent california journalist and reform politician whom	he asked for his support.	4.193681736832378
2254. lane was still burning because he had narrowly	missed election as governor of california in 1902 and laid his defeat	to the antagonism of hearst's san francisco examiner.	5.075234426887755
2255. hearst	disclaimed blame for this but the conversation according to lane	ended on a tart note.	4.21292691591616
2256. mr lane hearst said if	you ever wish anything that i can do all you will have to do will	be to send me a telegram asking and it will be done.	6.441716318651471
2257. mr	hearst lane replied as he left if you ever get a telegram	from me asking you to do anything you can put the telegram down	as a forgery.	3.9213451256874055
2258. hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to	new york to become a father.	6.1996984243972
2259. on april 10 1904 his first child was	born a son named george after the late senator.	4.532916277843813
2260. hearst saw his wife	and child sent a joyful message to his mother in california and	soon returned to washington where on april 22 for the first time	he opened his mouth in congress.	5.220316582803736
2261. this was not before the house	but before the judiciary committee where he asked for action on	one of his pet bills that calling for an investigation of the coal-railroad	monopoly.	4.181568034627935
2262. attorney shearn had worked on this for two years and	had succeeded in getting a report supporting his stand from the united	states attorney for the southern district of new york.	5.150057724421578
2263. hearst	had spent more than $60000 of his own money in the probe but still	attorney general knox was quiescent.	4.599860792692992
2264. six of the railroads	carrying coal to tidewater from the pennsylvania fields hearst said	not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright	at least eleven mines.	5.246383102707428
2265. they had watered their stock at immense	profit then had raised the price of coal fifty cents a ton netting themselves	another $20000000 in annual profit.	4.22700119109242
2266. the attorney	general has been brooding over that evidence like an old hen on a	doorknob for eighteen months hearst said.	4.889537613881
2267. he has not acted in	any way and won't let anyone take it away from him h what i want	is to have this evidence come before congress and if the attorney	general does not report it as i am very sure he won't as he has	refused to do anything of the kind i then wish that a committee of	seven representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence	h.	3.638170832999441
2268. the congressman tried hard but failed.	7.06780141323624
2269. this was the very	sort of legislation that roosevelt himself had in mind.	5.351351030536853
2270. there can	be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in washington overt or	implied to block anything hearst wanted even if it was something good.	6.996506715650364
2271. hatred tied his hands in congress.	5.945697125574486
2272. roosevelt and others considered	him partly responsible for the murder of mckinley.	7.425603215292813
2273. they were repelled	by his noisy newspapers his personal publicity his presumptuous	campaign for the presidential nomination and by the swelling cloud	of rumor about his moral lapses.	4.132190556588416
2274. he might get votes from his constituents	but he would never get a helping hand in congress.	6.007936347564594
2275. he was the	house pariah.	8.307639262778109
2276. even the regular democrats disowned him.	9.911497085338741
2277. inherently	incapable of cooperating with others he ran his own show regardless	of how many party-line democratic toes he stepped on.	3.8880356915934375
2278. he was a political	maverick a reformer with his own program determined to bulldoze	it through or to blazon the infamy of those who balked him.	6.168662434722319
2279. he showed	little interest in measures put forward by the regular democrats.	4.822306360567454
2280. he sought to run congress as he ran his new york american or	journal a scheme veteran legislators resisted.	5.67646389934755
2281. for a freshman congressman	to read political lessons to graybeard democrats was poor	policy for one who needed to make friends.	4.4457425502149786
2282. he soon quarreled with all	the party leaders in the house and came to be regarded with detestation	by regular democrats as a professional radical leading a small	pack of obedient terriers whose constant snapping was demoralizing to	party discipline.	5.527034818600441
2283. to old-line democrats the hearst presidential	boom now in full cry was the joke of the new century.	4.726343785034361
2284. yet no	leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to give the puissant t	r a semblance of a race.	6.421119720014632
2285. there was talk of dragging old ex-president	cleveland out of retirement for another try.	4.997482925001727
2286. some preferred	judge alton b parker of new york.	7.435669762913481
2287. there was a host of dark	horses.	8.644906545143828
2288. the sneers at hearst changed to concern when it was seen that	he had strong support in many parts of the country.	5.722041887956486
2289. platoons of hearst	agents were traveling from state to state in a surprisingly successful	search for delegates at the coming convention and there were charges	that money was doing a large part of the persuading.	4.058348490377974
2290. just when	it was needed for the campaign hearst paper no 8 the boston american	began publication.	6.460332970964366
2291. a bay state supporter said mr	hearst's fight has been helped along greatly by the starting of	his paper in boston.	3.8647511751838657
2292. his candidacy affected his journalism somewhat.	8.004567697319777
2293. he ordered his editors to tone down on sensationalism and to refrain	from using such words as seduction rape abortion	criminal assault and born out of wedlock.	3.7233200888047917
2294. in	a story headed hearst offers cash the republican new york	tribune spread the money rumor quoting an unnamed hearst	supporter as saying:   the argument that is cutting most	ice is that hearst is the only candidate who is fighting the trusts	fearlessly and who would use all the powers of government to disrupt	them if he were elected.	4.787043537796499
2295. the hearst men say that if hearst is nominated	he and his immediate friends will contribute to the democratic	national committee the sum of $1500000.	3.851264431249013
2296. this it is urged would	relieve the national committee from the necessity of appealing to the	trust magnates.	6.326541130359859
2297. the alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate	is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the	trusts for their campaign funds and in doing this will incur obligations	which would make a democratic victory absolutely fruitless h.	3.6647853522219314
2298. the average democratic politician especially in the country districts	is hungry for the spoils of office.	6.596830754164525
2299. it has been a long time since	he has seen any campaign money and when the proposition is laid down	to him as the friends of mr hearst are laying it down these days	he is quite likely to get aboard the hearst bandwagon.	4.202373961329738
2300. if	anything the conservative democrats were more opposed to hearst than	the republicans.	6.093123995732186
2301. in his own state of new york the two democratic	bellwethers state leader hill and tammany boss murphy were	saying nothing openly against hearst but industriously boosting their	own favorites murphy being for cleveland and hill for parker.	4.088626593952043
2302. they	had lost twice with the radical bryan and were having no part of	hearst whom they considered more radical than bryan.	5.160513208686437
2303. but his increasing	strength in the west looked menacing.	7.063613469358428
2304. it caused henry watterson	to sound a blast in his louisville courier-journal:	h does any sane democrat believe that mr hearst a person	unknown even to his constituency and his colleagues without a word	or	act in the public life of his country past or present that can be	shown to be his to commend him could by any possibility be elected president	of the united states?	4.701520794305867
2305.  but there is a hearst	barrel h	more splenetic was senator edward carmack of tennessee	a parker man.	5.39428767823006
2306. h the nomination of hearst would compass the ruin	of the party carmack said.	6.6210365316479045
2307. it would be a disgrace and as i	have already said to the people of tennessee if hearst is nominated	we may as well pen a dispatch and send it back from the field of	battle: 'all is lost including our honor'.	4.187895375892765
2308. a lone	pro-hearst voice from new york city was that of william devery	who had been expelled as a tammany leader but still claimed strong influence	in his own district.	5.7455877521082535
2309. i understand hearst is a candidate	for presidential honors devery said without cracking a smile.	4.466391352153205
2310. there's nothing like buildin' from the bottom up.	7.105761311167579
2311. if he's	going to the st louis convention as a delegate we ought to know it.	4.945998856802392
2312. he's got a lot of friends and he ought to come along and let us	know if he wants our help.	5.933646592222967
2313. hearst won the iowa state convention	but ran into a bitter battle in indiana before losing to parker	drawing an angry statement from indiana's john w kern:	we are menaced for the first time in the history of the republic	by the open and unblushing effort of a multi-millionaire to purchase	the presidential nomination.	3.9275854412654403
2314. our state has been overrun with a	gang of paid agents and retainers h as for the paid hessians from	other states we are here to instruct the indiana democracy in their	duty i have nothing but contempt h the hearst dollar mark is all	over them h	the talk of a hearst barrel was increasing.	4.649506772156475
2315. another indiana observer later commented perhaps we shall	never know how much was spent by hearst but if as much money	was expended elsewhere as in indiana a liberal fortune was squandered.	3.7089908991511957
2316. in his fight for the illinois and indiana delegations	hearst made several trips to chicago to confer with andrew lawrence	the former san francisco examiner man who was now his chicago	kingpin and once to meet with bryan.	5.139892392276157
2317. on one visit he stopped at	the office of the american where he was known surreptitiously as	the great white chief and for the first time met his managing	editor fat moses koenigsberg.	5.037324806546881
2318. koenigsberg never did learn what	hearst wanted for the latter shook hands and moved toward the door.	5.454336586728915
2319. never mind thank you he said.	6.390255629258279
2320. i must hurry to catch	my train.	9.17771882219509
2321. another editor pointed despairingly at a bundle	of letters that had accumulated for him saying but mr hearst	what shall i do with this correspondence?	3.871449109788049
2322.    i'll	show you hearst replied grinning.	8.18656221502958
2323. he took the stack of mail and	tossed it into the waste basket.	5.491810767747445
2324. every letter answers	itself in a couple of weeks.	9.2499599977014
2325. hearst hopped into a private railroad car with max ihmsen	and made an arduous personal canvass for delegates in the western and	southern states always wearing a frock coat listening intently to local	politicians and generally making a good impression.	3.5265965493086586
2326. he laughed	at a story that he planned to bolt the party if he was not nominated.	6.911070332400602
2327. i should of course he said like any other man be	honored and gratified should the democrats see fit to nominate me.	4.326156830503685
2328. but	i do not have to be bribed by office to be a democrat.	9.142414047428039
2329. i have supported	the democratic party in the last five campaigns.	7.622675318208957
2330. i supported	cleveland three times and bryan twice.	7.87626045103722
2331. i intend to support the nominee	of the party at st louis whoever he may be.	4.453639441157939
2332. the	hearst press followed the chief's progress at the various state conventions	with its usual admiring attention stressing the enthusiasm	and loyalty he inspired.	5.103675880876918
2333. this was historic in its way for	it marked the first time an american presidential aspirant had advertised	his own virtues in his own string of newspapers spanning the land.	4.405405028854206
2334. yet his editors did not abandon their sense of story value.	6.7514257353119875
2335. when nan patterson a stunning and money-minded chorus girl who	had appeared in a florodora road show rode down broadway in a hansom	cab with her married lover frank young she stopped the cab to	disclose that young had been shot dead tearfully insisting that he	had shot himself although experts said he could not have done so.	3.459825855443363
2336. trevelyan's liberalism was above all a liberalism of the spirit a	deep feeling of communion with men fighting for country and for liberty.	5.565780490742363
2337. his passion and enthusiasm convey the courage and high adventure	of garibaldi's exploits and give the reader a unique sense of participation	in the events described.	3.857469901875965
2338. the three volumes brought to	the fore a characteristic of trevelyan's prose which remained conspicuous	through his later works- a genius for describing military action	with clarity and with authority.	4.8828868668801535
2339. the confused rambling of guerrilla	warfare such as most of garibaldi's campaigns were was brought	to life by trevelyan's pen in some of the best passages in the books.	4.250881895737434
2340. his personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed	much to the final result but familiarity alone would not have	been enough without other qualities.	5.451695718968517
2341. military knowledge love of	detail and a sure feeling for the portrayal of action were the added	ingredients.	4.089291383406289
2342. but the garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic	story.	8.82395467664483
2343. trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge of the issues	connected with his subject.	5.165487368904411
2344. the outstanding example was in garibaldi	and the thousand where he made use of unpublished papers of	lord john russell and english consular materials to reveal the motives	which led the british government to permit garibaldi to cross	the straits of messina.	4.788307442593499
2345. in looking back over the volumes it	is possible to find errors of interpretation some of which were not	so evident at the time of writing.	4.685310866534475
2346. thus trevelyan repeats the story	which pictured victor emmanuel as refusing to abandon the famous statuto	at the insistence of general radetzky.	5.693388113784082
2347. later research has	shown this part of the legend of the re galantuomo to be false.	5.395885172915906
2348. trevelyan accepts italian nationalism with little analysis he is	unduly critical of papal and french policy and he is more than generous	in assessing british policy.	5.77691495332893
2349. but fifty years later the trilogy still	maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the unification	of italy a position cautiously prophesied by the reviewers at	the time of publication.	4.1836031556345965
2350. trevelyan's manin and the venetian	revolution of 1848 his last major volume on an italian theme	was written in a minor key.	5.160513208686437
2351. published in 1923 it did not gain the popular	acclaim of the garibaldi volumes probably because trevelyan	felt less at home with manin the bourgeois lawyer than with garibaldi	the filibuster.	3.7245250974027746
2352. the complexities of venetian politics eluded him	but the story of the revolution itself is told in restrained measures	with no superfluous passages and only an occasional overemphasis of	the part played by its leading figure.	4.846768088248792
2353. if it is not one of his best	books it can only be considered unsatisfactory when compared with his	own garibaldi.	6.367993206701707
2354. already trevelyan had begun to parallel	his nineteenth-century italian studies with several works on english	figures of the same period.	6.342330218555238
2355. first the life of john bright appeared	and seven years later lord grey of the reform bill.	5.314584843072216
2356. of	the two the life of bright is incomparably the better biography.	7.153163542300524
2357. trevelyan	centers too exclusively on bright is insufficiently appreciative	of the views of bright's opponents and critics and makes light	of the genuine difficulties faced by peel.	3.8779256547432093
2358. yet he is right when he	claims in his autobiography that he drew the real features of the man	his tender and selfless motives and his rugged fearless strength.	5.412979231752118
2359. in	the story of bright and the corn law agitation the crimean war	the american civil war and the franchise struggle trevelyan reflects	something of the moral power which enabled this independent man	to exercise so immense an influence over his fellow countrymen for so	long.	3.6036362957368477
2360. because bright's speeches were so much a part of him there	are long and numerous quotations which far from making the biography	diffuse help to give us the feel of the man.	5.872445618228377
2361. associated in a sense	with the manchester school through his mother's family trevelyan	conveys in this biography something of its moral conviction and drive.	3.8415486536058805
2362. nineteenth-century virtues however seem somehow to have gone out	of fashion and the bright book has never been particularly popular.	5.717002311160937
2363. the biography of lord grey is strictly speaking not a biography	at all.	4.062811260105332
2364. it is a whig history of the tory reaction which preceded	the reform bill of 1832 and it uses the figure of grey to	give some unity to the narrative.	5.623544630591468
2365. the volume is a piece of passionate	special pleading written with the heat- and often with the wisdom	it must be said- of a liberal damning the shortsightedness of politicians	from 1782 to 1832.	3.708542324472089
2366. characteristically trevelyan enjoyed writing	the work.	8.18656221502958
2367. the theme of glorious summer coming after a long winter	of discontent and repression was he has told us congenial to his artistic	sense.	3.888921303617723
2368. and grey's northumberland background was close to	trevelyan's own.	7.285029927075259
2369. but his concentration on personalities and his categorical	assessment of their actions fail to convey the political complexities	of a long generation harassed by world-wide war and confronted	with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social	transformation.	3.862990016856208
2370. some historians have found his point of view not	to their taste others have complained that he makes the tory tradition	appear contemptible rather than intelligible while a sympathetic	critic has remarked that the intricate interplay of social dynamics	and political activity of which at times politicians are the	ignorant marionettes is not a field for the exercise of his talents.	4.8752827577970566
2371. the liberal-radical heritage which informs all of trevelyan's	interpretations of history here seems clearly to have distorted the issues	and oversimplified the period.	3.5754695776410808
2372. for once his touch deserted him.	8.435087445035094
2373. research in the period of grey and bright led naturally to	a more ambitious work.	4.378765689913207
2374. britain in the nineteenth century is a textbook	designed to give the sense of continuous growth to show how	economic led to social and social to political change how the political	events reacted on the economic and social and how new thoughts and	new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated process.	5.1323084499326255
2375. the plan is admirably fulfilled for the period up to 1832.	4.647115427273328
2376. more temperately	than in the study of grey and despite his liberal bias trevelyan	vividly sketches the england of pre-french revolution days	portrays the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period in rich	colors and brings developments leading to the reform bill into sharp	and clear focus.	5.13457056846318
2377. his technique is genuinely masterful.	6.721040072046
2378. by what one	reader called a series of dissolving views he merges one period	into another and gives a sense of continuous growth.	6.59580872785468
2379. but after	1832 the narrative tends to lose its balanced many-sided quality	and to become a medley of topics often unconnected by any single thread.	4.1630974668282015
2380. economic analysis was never trevelyan's strong point and the	england of the industrial transformation cries out for economic analysis.	5.541861569867679
2381. yet after 1832 the interrelations of economic and social and political	affairs become blurred and the narrative becomes largely a conventional	political account.	4.164623322478657
2382. finally the period after 1870 receives	little attention and that quite superficial.	6.722345797034978
2383. yet britain in the nineteenth	century became the vade mecum of beginning students of	history went through edition after edition and continues to be reprinted	up to the very present.	3.975349283508359
2384. its success is a tribute above all to	trevelyan's brilliance as a literary stylist.	6.369022116140883
2385. in 1924 trevelyan	traveled to the united states where he delivered the lowell	lectures at harvard university.	5.225930141056863
2386. these lectures formed the nucleus of	a general survey of english development which took form afterward as	a history of england.	5.41483509992544
2387. in short order the general history became	his most popular work and has remained aside from his later social	history the work most widely favored by the public.	3.857305780218918
2388. the	history of england has often been compared with green's short	history.	6.289010577019261
2389. like green trevelyan aimed to write a history not	of english kings or english conquests but of the english people.	4.7298122311814685
2390. the history takes too much for	granted to serve as a text for other than english schoolboys and like	britain in the nineteenth century it deteriorates badly as it goes	beyond 1870.	5.420343712500161
2391. trevelyan's excursions into contemporary history were	rarely happy ones.	5.066959048406199
2392. but as a stimulating provocative interpretation	of the broad sweep of english development it is incomparable.	6.879883960758132
2393. living	pictures of the early boroughs country life in tudor and stuart	times the impact of the industrial revolution compete with sensitive	surveys of language and literature the common law parliamentary development.	3.91656762408862
2394. the strength of the history is also its weakness.	6.912730163513561
2395. trevelyan	is militantly sure of the superiority of english institutions and	character over those of other peoples.	4.131860641767443
2396. his	nationalism was not a new characteristic but its self-consciousness	even its self-satisfaction is more obvious in a book that stretches	over the long reach of english history.	5.504631229927604
2397. and yet the elements which	capture his liberal and humanistic imagination are those which make the	english story worth telling and worth remembering.	4.307292907734622
2398. tolerance and	compromise social justice and civil liberty are today too often in short	supply for one to be overly critical of trevelyan's emphasis on	their central place in the english tradition.	5.334472360475494
2399. like most major works	of synthesis the history of england is informed by the positive	views of a first-class mind and this is surely a major work.	4.650079815819078
2400. four years after the publication of the history of england the	first volume of trevelyan's queen anne trilogy appeared.	6.616165909268911
2401. by now	he had become regius professor of modern history at cambridge	and had been honored by the award of the order of merit.	4.673256270640645
2402. his academic	duties had little evident effect on his prolific pen.	6.763972756848804
2403. blenheim	was followed in rapid succession by ramillies and the union with	scotland and by the peace and the protestant succession the	three forming together a detailed picture of england under queen anne.	3.7738184298149355
2404. like his volume on wycliffe the work was accompanied by the	publication of a selected group of documents in this case illustrative	of the history of queen anne's reign down to 1707.	6.1783967834071065
2405. trevelyan	was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious	desire to take up the story where macaulay's history of england	had broken off.	4.251391685343213
2406. in addition he believed in the dramatic	unity and separateness of the period from 1702-14 lying between the stuart	and hanoverian eras with a special ethos of its own.	5.959813499459323
2407. he saw	the age as one in which britain settled her free constitution	and attained her modern place in the world.	4.579223771390572
2408. to most observers there	is little doubt that he placed an artificial strait jacket of unity upon	the years of anne's reign which in reality existed only in the	pages	of his history.	5.321104204565088
2409. of the three volumes blenheim is easily	the best.	6.9996058884794
2410. in four opening chapters reminiscent of macaulay's famous	third chapter trevelyan surveys the state of england at the opening	of the eighteenth century.	5.785339075122395
2411. his delightful picture of society and	institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period vividly	to life.	4.095434037828467
2412. he tends to underestimate- or perhaps to view charitably-	the brutality and the violence of the age so that there is an idyllic	quality in these pages which hazes over some of its sharp reality.	5.756911939706698
2413. yet as an evocation of time past there are few such successful	portraits	in english historical literature.	4.621896602689562
2414. once the scene is set trevelyan	skilfully builds up the tense story until it reaches its climax	in the dramatic victory of marlborough and eugene of savoy at blenheim.	5.327948988763115
2415. the account of the battle is next to his descriptions of garibaldi's	campaigns trevelyan's outstanding military narrative.	4.1731173407979085
2416. the	scene is etched in sharp detail the military problems brilliantly	explained and the excitement and importance of the battle made evident.	5.395217962137982
2417. if only for this modest masterpiece of military history blenheim	is likely to be read and reread long after newer interpretations	have perhaps altered our picture of the marlborough wars.	4.479363136381363
2418. ramillies	and the union with scotland has fewer high spots than blenheim	and much less of its dramatic unity.	5.455083845293674
2419. yet in several chapters	on scotland in the eighteenth century trevelyan copes persuasively	with the tangled confusion of scottish politics against a vivid background	of scottish religion customs and traditions.	4.044764882015812
2420. i stood on a table surrounded by hundreds of expectant young	faces.	6.674466772501587
2421. questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship	activities.	4.535752126583474
2422. after making a short statement about human rights and the	freedom to travel i told them i would be going to the kehl bridge	the next morning in order to cross the rhine into germany.	5.741950856857762
2423. may we come with you?	6.226304104061575
2424.  called out a dozen young voices.	8.889365059179132
2425. well i might not get that far i told them as actually	i have no papers to enter germany and as a matter of fact no permit	to return to france once i leave.	4.354280439716317
2426. that was all they needed.	11.03622819564427
2427. we would all meet at ten o'clock at	the kehl bridge five miles from strasbourg and march triumphantly	across into germany.	4.309011796809061
2428. there was only one hitch: the small town	of kehl on the other side of the rhine was still under french	jurisdiction.	7.687749722019284
2429. the real franco-german frontier was beyond the town's	limits.	4.862155093067419
2430. in fact all persons were permitted to cross the rhine into	kehl there being no sentry posted on the west side of the river.	6.334411688788991
2431. that evening as i learned later the students enjoying that	spontaneous immodesty in action known only to university students surged	out onto the streets of strasbourg overturning empty streetcars	marking up store fronts and shouting imprudently garry davis	to power!   as i got off the trolley at kehl bridge the	next morning i was met by what looked like 5000 students some of whom	were carrying sticks apparently for the coming battle with the	police.	3.386013527404762
2432. alarmed by this display of weapons i looked toward the bridge	and there saw stretched across the near side a cordon of policemen	their bicycles forming a roadblock before which stood several french	officers in uniform and a small waspish man in a brown derby.	4.520477566739151
2433. listen please i called to the students in french.	5.304195305053871
2434. i	thank you most heartily for being here.	7.1581511048922275
2435. this is full evidence of your	support for my principles.	5.762707418641686
2436. these principles however will not be served	by violence in any form.	7.676817268871142
2437. if they are right they will prevail of	and by themselves.	6.481902741621273
2438. i ask you all to support me in this.	7.072459549233392
2439. if one finger	is raised against the authorities all our moral power will vanish.	5.019458571686043
2440. your self-control in this respect will be the only witness to your	understanding of what i am saying.	7.588748214149904
2441. i have full confidence in you.	7.196488591053134
2442. i marched up to the waiting officials the students	massed behind me.	7.631725269650593
2443. as usual the press photographers were on hand.	5.888759986179997
2444. the waspish man stopped me three paces from the bicycle barricade	and asked me in french if i had papers to leave france.	4.9740918116539055
2445. i replied	in the affirmative taking out my recently acquired titre d'identite	et de voyage on which was stamped a permission to leave fran	e.	3.9975749753298873
2446. he examined it carefully handed it back and said eh bien	you may leave france.	5.811796091316399
2447. i took one step h eastward.	6.853114880045143
2448. one of the uniformed officers stepped in my way demanding to know	whether i had permission to enter germany.	5.935372484900631
2449. no i have	no permission to enter germany i told him.	5.24234030984636
2450. alors	you may go no farther he said imperiously.	6.806723317680827
2451. is this then	the frontier?	9.39294086666372
2452.  i asked him.	14.231794108501033
2453. at this	the students let out a yell knowing full well the actual frontier was	beyond the town of kehl.	4.466596956421029
2454. but i have no permission to re-enter	france and i have just left i told him.	8.441399422546006
2455. i must then	be standing on the line between france and germany.	5.141798172299723
2456. the	waspish man stepped forward.	8.978076491592427
2457. line?	11.00104558771429
2458.  line?	14.778306436938408
2459.  but there is no line	between france and germany that is no actual line h i mean	h   no line?	5.019311499126636
2460.  i asked.	14.11065101360885
2461. but if there is no line	how can there be two countries?	6.695973775968107
2462.  you have just given me permission	to leave france which i did.	7.4257141978136465
2463. and as you know	i have no permission to re-enter france once out.	5.092917139029969
2464. now i learn i	cannot	enter germany.	9.592882437809786
2465. obviously i'm stuck on the line between the two	countries.	5.385198174454018
2466. the students were laughing uproariously at this	piece of logic and even the policemen were trying hard not to smile.	5.263571285711722
2467. mais non the interior ministry man coaxed you	may come back to strasbourg now if you wish.	4.060235568763422
2468. oh?	14.778306436938408
2469.  then	will you give me a visa to re-enter france?	5.040663961047651
2470.    visa?	14.778306436938408
2471. 	but there is no question of a visa.	6.712312326585628
2472. you are still in france.	11.35026609060602
2473. ah then please tell me where the frontier is because this	gentleman here- i indicated the french occupation officer- informs	me that germany is just on the other side of him.	4.051661879957208
2474. the interior man looked uneasily at his french compatriot.	6.044556700915193
2475. from the	crowd were coming cries of he's right! there must be	a line! and bravo garry continue!   seeing their	hesitation i said well until i have permission to enter germany	or a visa to re-enter france i shall be obliged to remain here	h on the line between two countries whereupon i moved to the	side of the road parked my backpack against the small guardhouse on	the sidewalk sat down took out my typewriter and began typing the	above conversation.	3.303475743213318
2476. the reporters were questioning the interior	man and the french officer both of whom remained noncommittal as	to what action if any would be taken in my regard.	4.88443126367046
2477. finally they	went	off to file their stories after the photographers had taken pictures	of my latest vigil.	4.475561072140128
2478. the students crowded around asking questions slapping	me on the back and generally being friendly.	5.682446988236127
2479. but what	will you do this evening mr davis?	5.478714475307434
2480.  asked a young mustached	frenchman.	10.667503475428802
2481. it will be very cold.	9.535602769143255
2482. i don't know	i told him except that i will be here.	7.0515948701705025
2483. i shall	see about getting you a tent he said.	5.2647744347694285
2484. i have a small sports shop	in strasbourg.	9.941399236237736
2485. that would be a great help i told him	thanking him for his thoughtfulness.	6.228523367432315
2486. a special guard was posted at	my end of the bridge to make sure i didn't cross the ludicrousness	of the situation being revealed fully in that everyone else- men	women and children dogs cats horses cars trucks baby carriages-	could cross kehl bridge into kehl without surveillance.	4.995401044455767
2487. the	day passed eventfully enough with a constant stream of visitors some	stopping only to say hello others getting into serious conversations	such as one andre fuchs a free-lance journalist from strasbourg	who wrote an article for the nouvelle alsatian in highly sympathetic	terms.	3.3991520292124267
2488. some students from the university returned around six	with a large pot containing enough hot soup to last me a week.	5.8204078147186635
2489. a volunteer	food brigade had been arranged they told me which would supply	me with the necessities as long as i remained at the bridge.	4.080926861238909
2490. a little	later the sports shop man returned with a small pup tent.	6.0594467172730235
2491. one of	the girl students sitting by while i ate the thick soup asked me if	i had a sleeping bag.	4.317003691591584
2492. when i informed her that i didn't she said	she would borrow her brother's and bring it to me later that evening.	5.809759474818035
2493. you do not know me she said in good english but	my mother was your governess in philadelphia when you were a child.	4.609309841703197
2494. her name was esther peter.	9.535765508007623
2495. i was delighted to make that personal	contact in such trying and unusual circumstances.	5.249795115978837
2496. the peter family	proved wonderful and helpful friends in the following days mrs	peter little esther and raoul who generously lent me his sleeping	bag for my watch on the rhine.	4.868408039833405
2497. sighting a line from	the bridge to a small field directly to the side i pitched the tent	that evening on the stateless line digging a small trench around	it as best i could with a toy spade donated by a neighborhood child.	3.558377245076235
2498. the wind from the rhine was damp and chill necessitating a fire	for warmth.	5.289660241608596
2499. after scouring around a bit in the open area i came across	what proved to be tar-soaked logs which crackled and burned brightly	giving off vast rolls of smoke into the ashen sky.	4.069318026883973
2500. each evening	the students appeared with the soup kettle and several petits	pains esther usually being among them.	5.832498387033187
2501. i had advised friends to	write me to no man's land pont kehl between strasbourg and	kehl france-germany.	4.584484865691044
2502. sure enough mail began trickling in	delivered by a talkative highly amused french postman who informed me	there had been quite a debate at the post office as to whether that	address would be recognized.	5.067987305874112
2503. on christmas eve students brought	out two small christmas trees which i placed on either side of the	tent.	4.518192509818703
2504. as the field on which my tent was pitched was a favorite natural	playground for the kids of the neighborhood i had made many friends	among them taking part in their after-school games and trying desperately	to translate grimm's fairy tales into an understandable	french as we gathered around the fire in front of the tent.	5.022981560196263
2505. to my great	surprise and delight when they saw the two trees they went rushing	off returning shortly with decorations from their own trees.	4.052828695055901
2506. it was a merry if somewhat soggy christmas for me that year.	6.992378692164186
2507. in the mail were invitations to speak at the universities of cologne	heidelberg and baden-baden.	4.532098209954393
2508. twenty thousand world citizens at	stuttgart had signed a petition inviting me to visit their town.	6.0773746489344465
2509. when	dr adenauer was approached by a world citizen delegation to find	out his disposition of my case he gave them his personal approval	of my entry saying that all men advocating peace should be welcomed into	germany.	3.553469436193702
2510. the special guard however was still posted on kehl bridge.	5.642915486687364
2511. as it began raining at around eight o'clock on december	26th i retired into my tent early somewhat tired and discouraged	my body reacting sluggishly	because of the continued exposure.	3.935529452244703
2512. no matter	how large the fire i couldn't seem to shake off the chill that	day.	6.109572568620268
2513. oh mr davis are you there?	6.431498587359925
2514.  a voice drifted	in to me above the patter of the rain shortly after i had fallen	into a fitful sleep.	5.288221137104028
2515. who is it?	10.645623289340687
2516.    we're from	the council of europe british delegation.	7.1581511048922275
2517. may we have a word with	you?	6.634276487167651
2518.    i'm sorry.	11.84209401893956
2519. i've had a trying day and i just	can't make it out again i told them.	4.259973400819352
2520. later i learned that sir hugh dalton had expressed a desire	to see me hence their trip to no man's land.	5.533661086407709
2521. on	the evening of december 27th esther noticed my pallid look and rasping	voice.	4.839967212480457
2522. she entreated me to see a doctor and when i refused brought	one out to see me.	6.440250646924409
2523. i wouldn't	hear of it because it meant giving up the line though i	realized i was in poor shape physically.	4.357639160344937
2524. esther mistaking my hesitation	assured me that the hospital expense would be taken care of by	a leading merchant in strasbourg whom she had already approached.	5.14324284811628
2525. no it's not that i told her.	6.039439933523581
2526. you see once i relinquish	the position i've already established here i couldn't regain	it without sacrificing the logic of it.	5.739355470323787
2527. at that moment	up walked a tall young man with glasses who announced himself as a	world citizen from basel switzerland.	4.358188072597667
2528. without preliminaries esther	asked him if you are a world citizen will you take garry davis'	place in his tent while he goes to the hospital?	6.258269359534488
2529.    but	of course with pleasure he replied.	5.66037853959279
2530. i looked from her to him.	8.799382234666597
2531. what is your name?	9.793553827361483
2532.  i	asked him.	11.84209401893956
2533. you	have just enlisted for the 'rhine campaign'.	5.3285636594893
2534. esther	jumped up ran to him and gave him a little hug.	6.983567414594984
2535. now come garry we must go quickly.	6.068542166131948
2536. there is a police car	outside.	11.39216699017677
2537. maybe they will take us.	7.591642790158047
2538. such were the incongruities	of the situation that the very police assigned to check up on me	were drafted into driving me to the strasbourg hospital while world	citizen jean babel waved adieu from the line!	he remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of	the final desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy.	5.063369393355635
2539. when the	victory cheer went up this officer found himself still mounted with	his	horse pressed broadside against cleburne's log parapet in a tangled	group of infantrymen.	3.9341908829138013
2540. his hat was gone the tears were streaming	from his eyes.	6.523638640079553
2541. he never knew how he got there.	5.777119594567912
2542. six climactic minutes	in an individual's life left no memory.	7.20712947685657
2543. eight hundred and sixty-five	rebels surrendered within their works and a thousand more were	captured or surrendered themselves that night and the next day.	3.920609527023891
2544. eight	field guns were captured in position.	7.603896187885215
2545. seven battle flags and fourteen	officers' swords were sent to thomas' headquarters.	4.923341745686329
2546. it was	the only sizable assault upon infantry and artillery behind breastworks	successfully made by either side during the atlanta campaign.	5.865587385967457
2547. the	fourteenth regiment of ohio volunteers lost one-third of its numbers	within a few minutes among them being several men whose time of service	had expired but who had volunteered to advance with their regiment.	3.664873251991688
2548. the thirty-eighth regiment of ohio volunteers one of the regiments	in thomas' first division during buell's command suffered	its greatest loss of the war in this action.	5.837209276640257
2549. a popular belief	grew up after the war that the only time during the civil war that	thomas ever put his horse to a gallop was when he went to hurry up	stanley for this assault.	4.327141979488486
2550. sherman was responsible for the story when	he said in his memoirs that this was the only time he could recall	seeing thomas ride so fast.	6.555818511703389
2551. while thomas' injured back led him to	restrain his mount from its most violent gait he moved quickly enough	when he had to.	4.016157841489304
2552. it is not in the record but he must have galloped his	horse at peach tree creek when he brought up ward's guns to save	newton's crumbling line.	5.999881289409853
2553. while the final combat of the	campaign was being worked out at jonesborough thomas on sherman's	instructions ordered slocum now commanding the twentieth corps	to make an effort to occupy atlanta if he could do so without exposing	his bridgehead to a counterattack.	3.9038515236242173
2554. the dispatch must have been sent	after sundown on september 1.	6.426793705264519
2555. slocum made his reconnaissanace the	next morning found the town empty accepted the surrender of the mayor	and occupied the city a little before noon.	3.745413112461981
2556. on the morning	of september 2 the fourth corps and the armies of the tennessee and	the ohio followed the line of hardee's retreat.	5.8099087522496795
2557. about noon they	came up with the enemy two miles from lovejoy's station and deployed.	5.171959176699426
2558. the fourth corps assaulted and carried a small portion of the	enemy works but could not hold possession of the gain for want of cooperation	from the balance of the line.	5.486742717488852
2559. that night a note written in	slocum's hand and dated from inside the captured city came to sherman	stating that the twentieth corps was in possession of atlanta.	4.025834010601658
2560. before making the news public sherman sent an officer with the note	to thomas.	6.6657435411236925
2561. in a short time the officer returned and thomas followed	on his heels.	5.306941703382799
2562. the cautious thomas re-examined the note and then making	up his mind that it was genuine snapped his fingers whistled and	almost danced in his exuberance.	5.082990148223057
2563. the next day sherman issued	his orders ending the campaign and pulled his armies back to atlanta.	4.436962780386575
2564. the measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign is a matter	of personal choice.	5.730347021048914
2565. sherman laid great store by place captures.	5.3285636594893
2566. hood refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors.	6.289010577019261
2567. by	both standards thomas had the right to be proud.	5.7288913612225265
2568. thomas thanked	his men for their tenacity of purpose unmurmuring endurance cheerful	obedience brilliant heroism and high qualities in battle.	5.453707819790866
2569. sherman felt that his own part in the campaign was skillful and well	executed but that the slowness of a part of his army robbed him of the	larger fruits of victory.	4.36136994249047
2570. he supposed the military world would approve	of his accomplishment.	6.76723718881596
2571. whatever the military world thought	the political world approved it wholeheartedly.	5.386487729266408
2572. for some time despondency	in some northern quarters had been displayed in two ways- an	eagerness for peace and a dissatisfaction with lincoln.	5.883970292840073
2573. proposals	were in the air for a year's armistice.	6.065491970981232
2574. lincoln was sure that he would	not be re-elected.	7.732077468259328
2575. in the midst of this gloom at 10:05 pm	on september 2 slocum's telegram to stanton general sherman	has taken atlanta shattered the talk of a negotiated peace	and boosted lincoln into the white house.	3.8640024608841035
2576. to the republicans no	victory	could have been more complete.	8.30547464566342
2577. official congratulations	showered upon sherman and his army.	5.65654607106035
2578. lincoln mentioned their distinguished	ability courage and perseverance.	7.793815331733411
2579. he felt that this campaign would	be famous in the annals of war.	4.95415014434853
2580. grant called it prompt skillful	and brilliant.	7.729862521312878
2581. halleck described it as the most brilliant of the war.	5.537619460203243
2582. actually the atlanta campaign was a military failure.	8.154838924253891
2583. next	best to destroying an army is to deprive it of its freedom of action.	4.21292691591616
2584. sherman had accomplished this much of his job and then inexplicably	nullified it by his thirty-mile retreat from lovejoy's to atlanta.	5.288038833838506
2585. but so far as its territorial objectives were concerned the campaign	was successful.	5.58903048748664
2586. within the narrow frame of military tactics too	the experts agree that the campaign was brilliant.	6.287754733582655
2587. in seventeen weeks	the military front was driven southward more than 100 miles.	4.989883981734655
2588. there	was a battle on an average of once every three weeks.	7.696290040442503
2589. the skirmishing	was almost constant.	5.528658944428094
2590. in the summary of the principal events of the campaign	compiled from the official records there are only ten days which	show no fighting.	6.117348741386753
2591. the casualties in the army of the cumberland were	22807 while for all three armies they were 37081.	4.1473634014144976
2592. men were killed	in their camps at their meals and in their sleep.	6.533506679590386
2593. rifle fire often	kept the opposing gunners from manning their pieces.	4.681571082223364
2594. modern warfare	was born in this campaign- periscopes camouflage booby traps land	mines extended order trench raids foxholes armored cars night	attacks flares sharpshooters in trees interlaced vines and treetops	which were the forerunners of barbed wire trip wires to thwart a cavalry	charge which presaged the mine trap and the general use of anesthetics.	4.6121386092690555
2595. the use of map coordinates was begun when the senior officers	began to select tactical points by designating a spot as near the	letter o in the word mountain.	3.7514483912515844
2596. a few weeks later the maps were	being divided into squares and a position was described as being about	lots 239 247 and 272 with pickets forward as far as 196.	5.618961695058853
2597. this	system was dependent upon identical maps and thomas supplied them	from a mobile lithograph press.	4.21292691591616
2598. orders of the day began to specify the	standard map for the movement.	6.764016347674739
2599. sherman proved that a railway	base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the atlanta	campaign was the rapid repair of the tracks.	4.154468556245446
2600. to the rebels it seemed	as if sherman carried tunnels and bridges in his pockets.	6.46250228288623
2601. the whistle	of sherman's locomotives often drowned out the rattle of the skirmish	fire.	4.161298961366965
2602. as always the ranks worked out new and better tactics but	there was brilliance in the way the field commands adopted these methods	and in the way the army commanders incorporated them into their	military thinking.	6.154073708331505
2603. the fossilized formalized precedent-based thinking	of the legendary military brain was not evident in sherman's armies.	3.82769723001232
2604. sherman could never be accused of sticking too long with the old.	5.926734816808145
2605. one of sherman's most serious shortcomings however was	his mistrust of his cavalry.	5.26053809957973
2606. he never saw that it was a complement to	his infantry and not a substitute for it.	7.823795892284785
2607. then in some way this lack	of faith in the cavalry became mixed up in his mind with the dragging	effect of wagon trains and was hardened into a prejudice.	4.168240139995521
2608. a horse	needed twenty pounds of food a day but the infantryman got along with	two pounds.	5.62990098933409
2609. the horseman required eleven times more than the footman.	5.07120494624671
2610. so sherman tried a compromise.	9.641524200014828
2611. he would ship by rail five pounds per	day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that were needed could	be picked up off the country.	4.2348244399101365
2612. already debilitated	by the chattanooga starvation the quality of sherman's horseflesh	ran downhill as the campaign progressed.	6.637311518904082
2613. every recorded request by	thomas for a delay in a flank movement or an advance was to gain time	to take care	of his horses.	3.9652069435362427
2614. well led properly organized cavalry	in its complementary role to infantry had four functions.	6.436403744810787
2615. first	it could locate the enemy infantry learn what they were doing and hold	them until the heavy foot columns could come up and take over.	3.8340841125245206
2616. second	it could screen its own infantry from the sight of the enemy.	6.146190548590803
2617. third	it could threaten at all times and destroy when possible the enemy	communications.	4.791516073204641
2618. it could reach key tactical points faster than infantry	and destroy them or hold them as the case might be for the foot	soldier.	5.866031811147429
2619. its climactic role was to pursue and demoralize a defeated	enemy but this chance never came in the atlanta campaign.	4.444201380179842
2620. thomas tried	hard to have his cavalry ready for the test it was to meet but his	plans were wrecked when it was forced into a campaign without optimum	mobility and with its commander stripped from it.	5.520203785914628
2621. sherman knew	the uses of cavalry as well as thomas but he imagined a moving base	with infantry wings instead of cavalry wings.	4.255662397684196
2622. his conception proved	workable but slower and it enabled his enemy to make clean deft well	organized retreats with small materiel losses.	5.272119798833812
2623. sherman insisted that	cavalry could not successfully break up hostile railways yet garrard's	covington raid and rousseau's opelika raid cut two-thirds	of the rail lines he had to break and sherman lived in mortal fear of	what forrest might do to his communications.	3.5631565819879314
2624. when mcpherson	pushed blindly through snake creek gap in a potentially decisive	movement the only cavalry in his van was the ninth illinois mounted	infantry totally inadequate for its role.	5.083873307933685
2625. it stumbled on infantry	where no infantry should have been and mcpherson's aggressive impulse	faded out overwhelmed by fears of the unknown.	4.3734397418161
2626. a proper cavalry	command in his front would have developed the fact that he had run into	one division of polk's army of the mississippi moving up from	the direction of mobile to join johnston at dalton.	5.4479336750032
2627. from the night	of august 30 to the morning of september 2 there was no union cavalry	east of the macon railway to disclose to sherman that he was missing	the greatest opportunity of his career.	4.334565547599963
2628. a great part of the time	thomas' infantry never knew the location of the enemy line.	7.3646037506472615
2629. at such	times thomas wondered when and where a counterattack would strike	him.	5.100682744098605
2630. it was the hard way to fight a war but thomas did it without making	any disastrous mistakes.	6.173335007297446
2631. heat during the atlanta campaign	coupled with unsuitable clothing caused individual irritation that	was compounded by a lack of opportunity to bathe and shift into clean	clothing.	3.9326216478901572
2632. to relieve the itch and sweat galls the men got into the	water whenever they could and since each sizable stream was generally	the dividing line between the armies the pickets declared a private	truce while the men went swimming.	4.745666222668419
2633. johnston believed that sherman put	his naked engineers into the swimming parties to locate the various	fords.	4.131860641767443
2634. lieutenant colonel james p brownlow who commanded the	first brigade of thomas' first cavalry division was ordered across	one of these fords.	5.183217772848212
2635. the water was deep and brownlow took his troopers	across naked- except for guns cartridge boxes and hats.	3.813119115285028
2636. they	kicked their horses through the deep water with their bare heels drove	the rebels out of their rifle pits and captured four men.	5.4021705401876945
2637. most of	the rebels got away since they could make better time through the stiff	brush than their naked pursuers.	4.494124271941103
2638. rank was becoming an explosive	issue in all three of sherman's armies.	6.306779786010115
2639. merited recommendations	from army commanders were passed over in favor of political appointees	from civil life.	4.743279454812174
2640. in one of the very few letters in which he ever complained of	meynell thompson told patmore of his distress at having had to leave	london before this new friendship had developed further:	that was a very absurd and annoying situation in which i was placed	by	w m's curious methods of handling me.	5.391565438104925
2641. he never let me know	that my visit was about to terminate until the actual morning i was	to leave for lymington.	4.1981960187484155
2642. the result was that i found myself in the	ridiculous position of having made a formal engagement by letter for	the next week only two days before my departure from london.	5.165617330412916
2643. luckily	both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion	it was not i.	4.131860641767443
2644. it need hardly be remarked that thompson was not	generally known for his scrupulosity about keeping his social engagements	which makes his irritation in this letter all the more significant.	5.408644723600696
2645. when thompson and her daughter began a correspondence which	included fervent verses from pantasaph mrs king felt a proper	victorian alarm.	4.219039739009144
2646. some she knew looked upon thompson almost as a	saint	but others read in the hound of heaven what they took to	be the confessions of a great sinner who like oscar wilde had-	as one pious writer later put it- thrown himself on the swelling	wave of every passion.	4.778650131896762
2647. consequently on october 31 1896	mrs king wrote to thompson quite against her daughter's wishes	asking him not to recommence a correspondence which i believe	has been dropped for some weeks.	3.7336156321013445
2648. katherine was staying at a convent	and her mother felt that as thompson himself seems to have suggested	she might eventually stay there.	5.6274468922114265
2649. this prospect did not please mrs	king any more than did the possibility that her daughter might	marry a bohemian but she used it to suggest to thompson that	it	is not in her nature to love you.	3.7015186240568307
2650. for his part thompson	had explained in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an	honorable friendship between katie and himself.	6.2654438857635375
2651. at no time does he	seem to have proposed marriage and mrs king was evidently torn between	a concern for her daughter's emotions and the desire to believe	that the friendship might be continued without harm to her reputation.	3.793089632709118
2652. in any case she told thompson that she saw no reason why he might	not see katie again now that this frank explanation has been made	+ no one can misunderstand.	5.591349120193855
2653. she ended her letter with the assurance	that she considered his friendship for her daughter and herself	to be an honor from which she could not part without still more pain.	3.7719646400930347
2654. after thompson came to london to live he received a	letter from katie which was dated february 8 1897.	5.671927332655675
2655. she regretted	what she described as the unwarrantable + unnecessary check to their	friendship and said that she felt that they understood one another	perfectly.	4.2880470175766146
2656. this letter concluded with an invitation:   i	am a great deal at the little children's hospital.	6.40651008136934
2657. mr meynell	knows the way.	7.5941046847004054
2658. i know you are very busy now you are writing a great	deal + your book is coming out isn't it?	5.694639588583494
2659.  but if you are able + care	to come you know how glad i shall be.	5.642330249153353
2660. ever yours sincerely	katherine douglas king the invitation was accepted and	other letters followed in which she spoke of her concern for his health	and her delight in seeing him so much at home among the crippled	children she served.	4.840557112736054
2661. it is difficult to say what thompson expected	would come of their relationship which had begun so soon after his emotions	had been stirred by maggie brien but when katie wrote on april	11 1900 to tell him that she was to be married to the rev godfrey	burr the vicar of rushall in staffordshire the news evidently	helped to deepen his discouragement over the failure of his hopes	for a new volume of verse.	3.7494295090591563
2662. in a letter to meynell which was written	in june less than a month before katie's wedding he was highly	melodramatic in his despair and once again announced his intention of	returning to the life of the streets:   a week in arrears	and without means to pay i must go it is the only right thing.	5.7133003904384525
2663. h	perhaps mrs meynell would do me the undeserved kindness to keep	my own copy of the first edition of my first book with all its mementos	of her and the dear ones.	3.968699665670348
2664. h last not least there are some poems	which k king sent me when i was preparing	a fresh volume asking me to include them.	6.152069107444904
2665. the terrible blow of	the new year put an end to that project.	4.495254670628588
2666. i wish you would return them	to her.	8.335726223220808
2667. i have not the heart.	8.951289960988678
2668. h i never had the courage to look	at them when my projected volume became hopeless fearing they were	poor until now when i was obliged to do so.	5.681125179643374
2669. h o my genius young	and ripening you would swear- when i wrote them; and now!	what has it all come to?	4.084577490495227
2670.  all chance of fulfilling my destiny is	over.	8.123234652220082
2671. h i want you to be grandfather to these orphaned poems dear	father-brother now i am gone; and launch them on the world when their	time comes.	4.389845020459435
2672. for them a box will be lodgment enough.	7.727763597177291
2673. h katie cannot	mind your seeing them now; since my silence must have ended when	i gave the purposed volume to you.	4.084577490495227
2674. h i ask you to do me the last	favour of reading them by 8 to-morrow evening about which time i shall	come to say my sad good-bye.	5.278252413957213
2675. if you don't think much of them tell	me the wholesome truth.	5.34935195022934
2676. if otherwise you will give me a pleasure.	8.028565583458905
2677. o wilfrid! it is strange; but this- yes terrible step i	am about to take h is lightened with an inundating joy by the new-found	hope that here in these poems is treasure- or at least some	measure of beauty which i did not know of.	3.8882324486977797
2678. h thompson of	course	was persuaded not to take the terrible step; meynell once	again paid his debts and it was katie rather than thompson whose	life was soon ended for she died in childbirth in april 1901 in	the first year of her marriage.	5.236331952022914
2679. the orphaned poems mentioned	in the letter to meynell comprised a group of five sonnets which	were published in the 1913 edition of thompson's works under the	heading ad amicam plus certain other completed pieces and rough	drafts gathered together in one of the familiar exercise books.	3.7083541808910594
2680. the	publication of father connolly's the man has wings has made	more of the group available in print so that a general picture of	what it contained can now be had without difficulty.	5.395921319374567
2681. some of the poems	express a mood of joy in a newly discovered love; others suggest its	coming loss or describe the poet's feelings when he learns of a final	separation.	4.011183615050777
2682. the somewhat petrarchan love story which these	poems suggest cannot obscure the fact that undoubtedly they have more	than a little of autobiographical sincerity.	5.321501660103026
2683. when they were first	written there was evidently no thought of their being published and	those which refer to the writer's love for mrs meynell particularly	have the ring of truth.	4.1660186519221885
2684. in my song's young virgin date	for example thompson wrote: yea she that had my song's	young virgin date not now alas that noble singular she i nobler	hold though marred from her once state than others in their best integrity.	4.803734138174545
2685. my own stern hand has rent the ancient bond and thereof shall	the ending not have end: but not for me that loved her to be	fond lightly to please me with a newer friend.	3.756878904044019
2686. then hold it more than	bravest-feathered song that i affirm to thee with heart of pride	i knew not what did to a friend belong till i stood up true friend	by thy true side; whose absence dearer comfort is by far than	presences of other women are!   taking into account thompson's	capacity for self-dramatization and the possibility of a wish	to identify his own life with the misfortunes of other poets who had known	unhappy loves there can be no doubt about his genuine emotion for	katie king.	4.718875515076932
2687. that she was affected by his protestations seems obvious	but since she was evidently a sensible young woman- as well as	an outgoing and sympathetic type- it would seem that for her the word	friendship had a far less intense emotional significance than that	which thompson gave it.	3.6604861659777583
2688. from the outset she must have realized that	marriage with him was out of the question and although she was displeased	by the unwarrantable interference it seems probable that	she did agree with her mother's suggestion that the poet was perhaps	a man most fitted to live + die solitary + in the love	only of the highest lover.	5.083997733376745
2689. the poems which were addressed	to her while they are far more restrained than those of love in	dian's lap show no great technical advance over those of the narrow	vessel group and are if anything somewhat more labored.	3.8096006807311644
2690. their interest remains chiefly biographical for they throw some light	on the utter despair which overtook thompson in the spring and early	summer of 1900.	5.4461814949952085
2691. whether or not danchin is correct in suggesting	that thompson's resumption of the opium habit also dates from	this period is of course a matter of conjecture.	4.756867261810154
2692. reid simply states	without offering any supporting evidence that after he returned	to london he resumed his draughts of laudanum and continued this	right up to his death.	4.919953094486945
2693. there is every reason to recognize that in	the very last years of his life as we shall see thompson did take	the drug in carefully rationed doses to ease the pains of his illness	but the exact date at which this began has never been determined.	4.067961292625286
2694. if	as reid says nearly all his poetry was produced when he was not	taking opium there may be some reason to doubt that he was under	its influence in the period from 1896 to 1900 when he was writing the	poems to katie king and making plans for another book of verse.	5.459939012150776
2695. in	any event the critical productivity of that time is abundant proof that	if he was taking laudanum it was never in command of him to the extent	that it had been during his vagrant years.	3.9103854175023853
2696. meynell's remedy	for thompson's despondent mood was typically practical.	6.806723317680827
2697. he simply	found more work for him to do and the articles and reviews continued	without an evident break.	4.687206911796087
2698. as a reviewer thompson	generally displayed a judicious attitude.	8.120550398711721
2699. that he read some	of the books assigned to him with a studied carefulness is evident from	his notes which are often so full that they provide an unquestionable	basis for the identification of reviews that were printed without	his signature.	3.8024494964955853
2700. on the basis of this careful reading thompson frequently	gave a clear complete and interesting description of a prose work	or chose effective quotations to illustrate his discussions of poetry.	5.733559935335438
2701. he was seldom an unmethodical critic and his reviews generally	followed a systematic pattern: a description of what the work	contained a treatment of the things that had especially interested him	in it and wherever possible a balancing of whatever artistic merits	and faults he might have found.	4.1912360809852816
2702. it was of course in this	drawing	of the balance sheet of judgment that he most clearly displayed his desire	to do full justice to an author.	5.906527672288776
2703. reviewing davidson's the	testament of an empire builder for example thompson found	that	there was too much metrical dialectic.	4.171212075485039
2704. poetry he said must be	dogmatic: it must not stoop to argue like a kc in	cloth-of-gold.	6.034784500247031
2705. yet davidson impressed him as a poet capable of sustained	power passion or beauty and he cited specific passages	to illustrate not only these qualities but davidson's command of	imagery as well.	3.8954334446367573
2706. similarly he wrote that laurence housman had a too	deliberate manner as well as a lack of inevitable felicity	in diction.	7.092466361891213
2707. but he admired housman's subtle intellectuality	and delighted in the inversion by which divine love becomes the most	fatal allurement in love the tempter.	4.116037062124116
2708. of course	there were books about which nothing good could be said.	6.983498038125148
2709. understanding	as he did the difficulty of the art of poetry and believing	that the only technical criticism worth having in poetry is that of	poets he felt obliged to insist upon his duty to be hard to please	when it came to the review of a book of verse.	3.863556873401302
2710. as he had done on his first imperial sortie a year and a half	before lewis trekked southeast through red russia to kamieniec.	6.486264188358407
2711. thence he pushed farther south than he had ever been before into podolia	and nogay tartary or the yedisan.	4.226404858747495
2712. there along the east bank	of the southern bug opposite the hamlet of zhitzhakli a few miles	north of the black sea he arrived at general headquarters of the	russian army.	5.197952241414716
2713. by june 19 1788 he had presented himself to its commander	in chief the governor of the southern provinces the director	of the war college- the prince.	4.211508240359489
2714. catherine's first	war against the grand turk had ended in 1774 with a peace treaty	quite favorable to her.	5.368720319504203
2715. by 1783 her legions had managed to annex the	crimea amid scenes of wanton cruelty and now in this second combat with	the crescent were aiming at suzerainty over all of the black sea's	northern shoreline.	3.9545802541584414
2716. through most of 1787 operations on	both sides had been lackadaisical; those of 1788 were going to prove	decisive though many of their details are obscure.	5.634066937128378
2717. to consolidate what	her navy had won the czarina was fortunate that for the first	time in russian history her land forces enjoyed absolute unity of command	under her favorite giaour.	3.869917021810831
2718. potemkin was directing this conflict	on three fronts: in the caucasus; along the danube and among the	carpathians in alliance with the emperor joseph's armies; and	in the misty marshlands and shallow coastal waters of nogay tartary	and taurida including the crimean peninsula.	4.566266898261206
2719. here the war would	flame to its focus and here lewis littlepage had come.	5.0221485136104445
2720. potemkin's	army of ekaterinoslav totaling it was claimed 40000 regular	troops and 6000 irregulars of the cossack corps had invested	islam's principal stronghold on the north shore of the black sea	the fortress town of oczakov and was preparing to test the turk by	land and sea.	4.766619506952968
2721. during a sojourn of slightly more than three months chamberlain	littlepage sould see action on both elements.	5.060496678081635
2722. as his	second in command the prince had marshal repnin one-time ambassador	to poland.	6.451761892736128
2723. repnin who had a rather narrow face longish nose	high forehead and arching brows looked like a quizzical mephistopheles.	4.3469931258559935
2724. some people thought he lacked both ability and character but	most	agreed that he was noble in appearance and for a russian humane.	6.380855014896083
2725. the marshal came to know littlepage quite well.	4.465110340486763
2726. at general headquarters	the newcomer in turn got to know others.	7.4968914640470645
2727. there was the neapolitan	ribas a capable conniver whose father had been a blacksmith	but who had fawned his way up the ladder of catherine's and potemkin's	favor till he was now a brigadier	designated to do in czar paul 1 after traveling all the	way	.	3.966619402170814
2728. then there were	the distinguished foreign volunteers.	9.840976047983181
2729. representing the emperor were	the prince de ligne still as impetuous as a youth of twenty; and	general the count pallavicini founder of the austrian branch of	that celebrated italian house a courtier littlepage could have met	at madrid in december 1780.	3.4710386694245847
2730. from milan came the young chevalier	de litta an officer in the service of malta.	6.9059816079190774
2731. out of saxony rode	the prince of anhalt-bernburg one of the czarina's cousins and	a lieutenant general in her armies a frank sensitive popular soldier	whose kindnesses littlepage would always recall with the sincerest	gratitude.	4.068531710541944
2732. though catherine was vexed at the number of	french officers streaming to the turkish standard there were several	under her own such as the prince de nassau; the energetic parisian	roger de damas three year's littlepage's junior to whom	nassau had taken a liking; and the artillerist colonel prevost	whom the count de segur had persuaded to lend his technical skills	to nassau.	4.743524298034135
2733. england contributed a young subaltern named newton and	the naval architect samuel bentham brother to the economist who far	his colonel's commission was proving a godsend to the russian fleet.	3.669295902578233
2734. from america were the messrs littlepage and jones.	7.856091669936294
2735. lewis had expected to report at once to jones's and nassau's naval	command post.	4.5672993028942805
2736. on arrival at headquarters he had however- in king	stanislas' words to glayre- found such favor with pe	potemkin that he made him his aide-de-camp and up to now does not want	him to go join paul jones h.	4.883525710974319
2737. so of course he stayed put.	6.805916272719226
2738. having	done so he began to experience all the frustrations of others who	attempted to get along with serenissimus and do a job at the same	time.	5.35704698924832
2739. the prince's perceptions were quick and his energy monstrous	but these qualities were sapped by an oriental lethargy and	a policy of letting nothing interfere with personal passions.	3.45531042499369
2740. at headquarters-	sufficiently far from the firing line to make you forget occasionally	that you were in a war- lewis found that the commander	in chief's only desk was his knees.	5.7329824473074416
2741. an entire theater had been set up for his diversion with a 200-man	italian orchestra under the well-known sarti.	4.581393001773743
2742. in the great one's	personal quarters a portable house almost every evening saw an elegant	banquet or reception.	5.918799700951628
2743. lewis could let his eye caress the prince's	divan covered with a rose-pink and silver turkish cloth or admire	the lovely tapis interwoven with gold that spread across the floor.	3.646156754961095
2744. filigreed perfume boxes exuded the aromas of araby.	6.806723317680827
2745. around the	billiard tables were always at least a couple of dozen beribboned generals.	5.7257655313136855
2746. at dinner the courses were carried in by tall cuirassiers in red	capes and black fur caps topped with tufts of feathers marching in	pairs like guards from a stage tragedy.	5.047065850625237
2747. among the visitors arriving	every now and then there were of course women.	5.983546283140086
2748. for if serenissimus	made the sign of the cross with his right hand and meant it	with his left he beckoned lewdly to any lady who happened to catch his	eye.	5.175118495712879
2749. usually lewis would find at headquarters one or more of the	prince's various nieces.	5.3849395679192895
2750. right now he found sophie de witt	that magnificent young matron he had spotted at kamieniec fours years	ago.	5.536413727536484
2751. the prince took her with him on every tour around the area	and it was rumored he was utilizing her knowledge of constantinople	as part of his espionage network.	3.7139615581478407
2752. one evening he passed around the banquet	table a crystal cup full of diamonds requesting every female guest	to select one as a souvenir.	5.324634848090169
2753. when a lady chanced to soil a pair of	evening slippers brigadier bauer was dispatched to paris for replacements.	4.401057725919587
2754. but if the prince fancied women and was fascinated	by foreigners he could be haughtiness personified to his subordinates.	6.4218527204639955
2755. he had collared one of his generals in public.	6.650492778413302
2756. his coat trimmed	in sable diamond stars of the orders of saints andrew or george agleam	he was often prone to sit sulkily eye downcast in a scheherazade	trance.	4.966812371978331
2757. when this happened everything stopped.	7.9840742703329735
2758. as littlepage	noted: a complete picture of prince potemkin may be had in his	1788 operations.	6.8131734463349565
2759. he stays inactive for half the summer in front of oczakov	a quite second-rate spot begins to besiege it formally only	during the autumn rains and finally carries it by assault in	the heart of winter.	3.790707824395304
2760. there's a man who never goes by the ordinary road	but still arrives at his goal who gratuitously gets himself into	difficulty in order to get out of it with eclat in a word a man who creates	monsters for himself in order to appear a hercules in destroying	them.	6.063310474044464
2761. to help him do so the prince had conferred control	of his land forces on a soldier who was different from him in almost	every respect save one: both were eccentrics of the purest ray	serene.	3.894026589728501
2762. alexander vasilievitch suvorov now in his fifty-ninth	year was a thin worn-faced person	of less than medium height who looked like a professor of botany.	5.232302941609629
2763. he	had a small mouth with deep furrows on either side a large flat nose	and penetrating blue eyes.	4.05748314857755
2764. his gray hair was thin his face beginning	to attract a swarm of wrinkles.	6.031086697756122
2765. but suvorov's face	was also a theater of vivacity and his tough stooping little frame	was briskness embodied.	4.255102199046069
2766. like all russians he was an emotional man	and in him the emotions warred.	7.1787753165309365
2767. kind by nature he never refused charity	to a beggar or help to anyone who asked him for it	.	4.117371713692901
2768. but he was perpetually engaged in a battle to	command his own temper.	8.261447762848455
2769. when littlepage was introduced if the	general behaved as usual the newcomer faced a staccato salvo of queries:	origin?	4.28715581208752
2770.  age?	14.778306436938408
2771.  mission?	11.00104558771429
2772.  current status?	11.84209401893956
2773.  woe betide the	interviewee if he answered vaguely.	5.3285636594893
2774. suvorov's contempt for don't-know's	was proverbial; better to give an asinine answer than none	at all.	5.711636206923082
2775. despising luxuries of any sort for a soldier he slept on a	pile of hay with his cloak as blanket.	3.8880356915934375
2776. he rose at 4:00 am the	year round and	was apt to stride through camp crowing like a cock to wake	his men.	5.264349313818428
2777. his breakfast was tea; his dinner fell anywhere from nine	to noon; his supper was nothing.	4.245055804092497
2778. he hadn't worn a watch or carried	pocket money for years because he disliked both but highest among	his hates were looking glasses: he had snatched one from an officer's	grasp and smashed it to smithereens.	4.743037527339389
2779. he kept several pet birds	and liked cats well enough that if one crept by he would mew at it in	friendly fashion.	3.9381138202408583
2780. passing dogs were greeted with a cordial bark.	7.532553158586802
2781. yet general suvorov- who had never forgotten hearing his adored	czarina declare that all truly great men had oddities- was mad	only north northwest.	3.965573564273856
2782. he had come to learn that a reputation for peculiarity	allowed mere field officers a certain leeway at court; in	camp he knew it won you the affection of your men.	5.673615928753992
2783. he had accordingly	cultivated eccentricity to the point of second nature.	6.567765155995667
2784. underneath he	remained one of the best-educated russians of his day.	7.736685323260153
2785. he dabbled	in verse could get along well among most of the european languages	and was fluent in french and german.	4.459539347756747
2786. he had also mastered the cossack	tongue.	9.390109217835334
2787. for those little men with the short whiskers shaven	polls and top knots suvorov reserved a special esteem.	4.575888442472528
2788. potemkin-	as king stanislas knew and presently informed littlepage- looked	on the cossacks as geopolitical tools.	5.659455227543579
2789. to serenissimus such tribes	as the cossacks of the don or those ex-bandits the zaporogian	cossacks	were just	elements for enforced resettlement in say bessarabia where as	the faithful of the black sea borders he could use their presence	as baragining points in the czarina's territorial claims against	turkey.	3.5249449740758223
2790. suvorov saw in these scimitar-wielding skirmishers not demographic	units but military men of a high potential.	5.7114979418174086
2791. he knew how to	channel their exuberant disorderliness so as to transform them from mere	plunderers into a-1 guerrilla	fighters.	4.569984125744721
2792. he always kept a few on his	personal staff.	7.082716428078146
2793. he often donned their tribal costumes such as the	one featuring a tall black sheepskin hat from the top of which dangled	a little red bag ornamented by a chain of worsted lace and tassels;	broad red stripes down the trouser leg; broader leather belt round	the waist holding cartridges and light sabre.	3.622685006061805
2794. suvorov played parent	not just to his cossacks but to all his troops.	6.105822821509379
2795. it was probably at	this period that littlepage got his first good look at the ordinary	russian soldier.	4.959690572178791
2796. these illiterate boors conscripted from villages	all across the czarina's empire had suvorov may have told lewis	just two things a commander could count on: physical fitness and	personal courage.	4.979235222828411
2797. when their levies came shambling into camp they	were all elbows hair and beard.	4.694570880188696
2798. they emerged as interchangeable cogs	in a faulty but formidable machine: shaved nearly naked hair queued	greatcoated jackbooted and best of all- in the opinion of the	british professional major semple-lisle- their minds are not	estranged from the paths of obedience by those smatterings of knowledge	which only serve to lead to insubordination and mutiny.	4.71520979856554
2799. mando pleading her cause must have said that dr brown was the	most distinguished physician in the united states of america for	our man poured out his symptoms and drew a madly waving line indicating	the irregularity of his pulse.	4.047157141994892
2800. he's got high blood pressure too	and bum kidneys the doctor said to me.	5.9017873324873715
2801. transparent look waxy	skin- could well be uremia.	5.3285636594893
2802. he looked disapprovingly at an ash	tray piled high with cigarette stubs shook his head and moved his	hand back and forth in a strong negative gesture.	5.3881128551752
2803. the little official	hung his head in shame.	5.077778341694363
2804. seeing this his colleague at the next desk	gave a short contemptuous laugh pushed forward his own ash tray innocent	of a single butt thumped his chest to show his excellent condition	and looked proud.	4.908210790872238
2805. the doctor gravely nodded approval.	5.1484054791855955
2806. at this moment mando came hurrying up to announce that the problem	was solved and all norton had to do was to sign a sheaf of papers.	5.899980248495711
2807. we	went out of the office and down the hall to a window where documents	and more officials awaited us the rest of the office personnel hot	upon our heels.	4.617356261995434
2808. by this time word had got around that an american doctor	was on the premises.	6.877564860182365
2809. one fellow who had liver spots held out his	hands to the great healer.	5.241924542467877
2810. it was funny but it was also touching.	8.954637899343217
2811. you	know norton said to me later i am thinking of setting	up the klinico brownapopolus.	4.21292691591616
2812. i might not make any money but i'd	sure have patients.	7.031909750561856
2813. after luncheon we took advantage of	the siesta period to try to get in touch with a few people to whom our	dear friend deppy had written.	4.727688876894251
2814. deppy is despina messinesi a long-time	member of the vogue staff who although born in boston was	born there	of greek parents.	5.22301107017409
2815. several years of her life have been spent in	the homeland and she had written to friends to alert them of our coming.	4.225623268435049
2816. all you have to do ilka dear is to phone on your arrival.	7.6457991753866965
2817. they are longing to see you.	6.8027327880263675
2818. the wear and tear of life have taught	me that very few friends of mutual friends long to see foreign strangers	but i planned on being the soul of tact of giving them plenty	of outs was there the tiniest implication that their cups were already	running over without us.	4.352211395085572
2819. greek phone service	is worse than french so that it was to be some little time before	contact of any sort was established.	5.384108355500481
2820. in the late afternoon	mando came back to fetch us and we drove to the acropolis.	6.734535412731918
2821. we stopped	first at the amphitheater that lies at the foot of the height crowned	by the parthenon.	4.627526254201939
2822. the curving benches are broken chipped tumbled	but still in place as are the marble chairs the seats of honor	for the legislators.	4.949813063038334
2823. the carved statues of the frieze against the low	wall are for the most part headless but their exquisitely graceful nude	and draped torsos and the kneeling atlantes are well preserved in	their perfect proportion.	3.6178011373660435
2824. having completed our camera work we	started our climb.	7.589617592406693
2825. i suppose the same emotion holds if to a lesser	degree with any famous monument.	4.760886238405184
2826. will it live up to its reputation?	8.716480462772502
2827. 	the weight of fame and history is formidable and dreary steel engravings	in schoolbooks do little to quicken interest and imagination.	3.9210618293018125
2828. uh	huh we think looking at them so that's the parthenon.	6.289010577019261
2829. and then	perhaps one day we get to athens.	5.423012892417793
2830. we are here! we've come a	long way and spent a lot of money.	7.596345508836751
2831. it had better be good.	8.25360658054819
2832. don't worry	about the acropolis.	8.978076491592427
2833. probably every visitor	has a favorite time for his first sight of it.	4.747016913852782
2834. we saw it frequently	afterward but our suggestion for the very first encounter is near sunset.	6.508198457070636
2835. the light at that time is a benediction.	4.892589357898408
2836. the serene majestic	columns of the parthenon tawny in color against the pure deep blue sky	frame incredible vistas.	4.994484465085144
2837. all we wanted to do was to stand very quietly	and look and look and look.	4.776282961498147
2838. more than twenty-four hundred	years old bruised battered worn and partially destroyed combining	to an astounding degree solidity and grace it still stands incomparable	testimony to man's aspiration.	5.40237799659895
2839. in 1687 the turks who had been	in control of the city since the fifteenth century with a truly shattering	lack of prudence used the parthenon as a powder magazine.	4.218351769765075
2840. it	was hit by a shell fired by the bombarding venetian army and the great	central portion of the temple was blown to smithereens.	5.907694045400475
2841. nearby	is the temple of athena.	7.001813254776093
2842. the architectural feature the caryatides	upholding the portico famous around the world as the porch of the	maidens was referred to airily by mando as the girls' place.	5.046588088496747
2843. another beautiful building is the propylaea the entrance gate of the	acropolis.	4.861461033021975
2844. my other nugget of art and architectural knowledge-	besides remembering that it was ghiberti who designed the doors	of the baptistery in florence- is the three styles of greek columns.	5.615105627983314
2845. for some happy reason doric ionic and corinthian have always	stuck in my mind.	4.941196588156929
2846. furthermore i can identify each design.	8.562228817309876
2847. it remained	however for mando to teach me that doric symbolized strength	ionic wisdom and corinthian beauty the three pillars of the ancient	world.	4.047968116977272
2848. the columns of the parthenon are fluted doric.	6.070428011880773
2849. another	classic sight that gave us considerable pleasure was the evzone sentry	in his ballet skirt with great pompons on his shoes who was patrolling	up and down in front of the palace.	3.8879624791770113
2850. gun on shoulder he would	march smartly for a few yards bring his heels together with a click	make a brisk pirouette skirts flaring and march back to his point	of departure.	5.444568847557739
2851. we did not dare speak to so exalted a being but norton	aimed his camera and shot him so to speak on the rise the split second	between the halt and the turn.	3.9188137675869004
2852. the evening of our first	day we drove with christopher and judy sakellariadis who were friends	and patients of norton to dine at a restaurant on the shores of	the aegean.	4.809271084629794
2853. on the way out mr sakellariadis detoured up a special	hill from which one may obtain a matchless view of the acropolis lighted	by night.	4.6956191954686854
2854. the great spectacle was a source of rancor and	son et lumiere which the french were trying to promote with the	athenians	was the reason.	5.439396751074791
2855. these performances were being staged at historical	monuments throughout europe.	5.17561394638704
2856. by a combination of music lighting	effects and narration famous events that have transpired in	these	locations are evoked and re-created for large audiences usually to	considerable acclaim.	5.625043539260055
2857. the acropolis had been scheduled for the treatment	too but apparently it was to take place at the time of the full	moon when the athenians themselves out of respect for the natural beauty	of the occasion were wont to forgo their own usual nocturnal illumination.	4.1190186984121615
2858. athenian society was split into two factions the philistines	and the artists.	6.093123995732186
2859. the artists contended that the philistines	gross of soul were all for having son et lumiere since the	french were footing the bill and the attraction wherever it had been	done had proven popular.	3.371944960000622
2860. this was the crassest kind of materialism	and they the artists would have no truck with it.	6.36521170659783
2861. the acropolis	was unique in the world and if that imcomparable work flooded by moonlight	wasn't enough for both natives and tourists then they were quite	simply barbarians	and the hell with them.	4.026187934348401
2862. the restaurant to which the sakellariadises took us on this night	of controversy was the asteria on asteria beach.	5.198464663222612
2863. this is a public	bathing beach easily accessible by tramway from the center of athens.	5.684657326466835
2864. office workers frequently go out there to lunch and swim during	the siesta period which during the summer lasts from two until five	in the afternoon when shops and offices are again open for business.	4.745133192439729
2865. they close sometime after eight.	6.678198458383702
2866. nine o'clock is the rush hour	when the busses are jammed and by nine-thirty the restaurants are beginning	to fill.	5.455751873105961
2867. bedtime is late for the balmy evenings are delightful	and everyone wants to linger under the stars.	4.060235568763422
2868. the sand is fine	and pleasant the cabanas are clean and the parasols green raspberry	and butter yellow are very gay.	4.889557281264576
2869. although open to the general	public it is not overcrowded; the atmosphere is that of an attractive	private beach club at home.	5.248283131468995
2870. we went there a couple of times to swim	and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.	7.359516737607364
2871. this agreeable state of affairs is	explicable i think on two counts.	4.742517740071099
2872. one is greece is not yet suffering	from overpopulation.	8.833902179645746
2873. the public may still find pleasure in public	places.	5.056047469585616
2874. the other is that the charge for cabanas and parasols though	modest from an american point of view still is a little high for	many athenians.	6.382252127832015
2875. we were struck by the notable absence of banana skins	and beer cans but just so that we wouldn't go overboard on greek	refinement perfection was side-stepped by a couple of braying portable	radios.	4.177038453501373
2876. greek boys and girls also go for rock-and-roll and the stations	most tuned to are those carrying united states overseas programs.	5.228606742935826
2877. a good deal of english was spoken on the beach most educated greeks	learn it in childhood and there were also american wives and	children of our overseas servicemen.	4.373432526527859
2878. for a delightful drive out	of athens i should recommend sounion at the end of the attic peninsula.	7.072475212094699
2879. the road a comparatively new one is very good winding along	inlets coves and bays of deep and brilliant blue.	3.8874939443391754
2880. i suppose the	day will inevitably come when the area will be encrusted with developments	but at present it is deserted and seductive.	6.203863612765604
2881. three beneficial	hurdles to progress are the lack of water electricity and telephones.	5.6726800236191135
2882. at sounion there is a group of beautiful columns the ruins	of a temple to poseidon of particular interest at that time as active	reconstruction was in progress.	6.308675539983099
2883. gaunt scaffoldings adjoined the ruins	and on the ground segments of columns two and a half to three feet	in thickness were being fitted with sections cunningly chiseled to	match exactly the fluting and proportion of the original.	3.891777724003707
2884. later they	would be hoisted into place.	8.990904196138981
2885. there is a mediocre restaurant at	sounion and i fed a thin little grecian cat and gave it two saucers	of water- there was no milk- which it lapped up as though it were	nectar.	4.168667794104634
2886. i think its thirst had never been assuaged before.	8.592024464816907
2887. norton	and i dined one night in a sea-food restaurant in piraeus right	on the water's edge.	4.383901597734437
2888. to enter it you go down five or six steps	from the road.	6.7738473087093825
2889. across the road is the kitchen and waiters bearing great	trays of dishes dodge traffic as nimbly as their french colleagues	at the restaurant in the place du tertre in paris.	3.746832148246353
2890. this restaurant	too had a cat a dusty thin little creature.	6.446870580593752
2891. how can	a cat be thin in a fish restaurant?	5.542381678181129
2892.  but this one was.	11.961038610172764
2893. when offered	a morsel it glanced right and left and winced obviously frightened	and expecting a kick but too hungry not to snatch the tidbit.	3.9988947542072966
2894. greece	was one of the highlights of our trip but beginning in greece and continuing	around the world throughout southeast asia the treatment of	animals was horrifying ranging from callous indifference to active	cruelty.	5.242165578835588
2895. this of course was not true of the educated and sophisticated	people we met who loved their pets but kindness is not a basic human	instinct.	4.357445843974753
2896. we met some charming athenians and among them our	chauffeur panyotis ranked high.	6.400933975759561
2897. his english was limited and the	little he knew he found irritating.	4.933607101269104
2898. a particularly galling phrase was	ok panyotis we have time at our disposal.	5.87562201923575
2899. this he	claimed was the favorite refrain of the english.	4.987041256881453
2900. they would be lolling	under a tree sipping ouzo relishing the leisurely life assuring	him that the day was yet young.	5.9882514251534005
2901. let him become honest and they discard him.	6.015403855758771
2902. but let him be ready	to invent whatever falsehood- to assail whatever character- and	to prostitute his paper to whatever ends- and they hug him to their	heart.	5.14349807808468
2903. in proportion to the degradation of his moral worth is the	increase of his worth to them.	4.555864188059599
2904. to exonerate the legislature	and thereby extricate himself from a sticky situation pike took another	course and made it appear that the legislature had been bilked.	5.3528666881723685
2905. he	claimed in his attacks that woodruff with scurrilous underhandedness	had deliberately written an ambiguous bid that had so confused the	honest members of the legislature that they had awarded him the contract	without knowing what they were doing.	4.1392494817748275
2906. the charge was so farfetched	that woodruff paid little attention to it and answered pike	in a rather bored way wearily declaring that a new hand was	pumping the bellows of the crittenden organ and concluding: in	a controversy with an adversary so utterly destitute of moral principles	even a triumph would entitle the victor to no laurels.	4.459285268351297
2907. the game	is not worth the ammunition it would cost.	4.320730508808147
2908. we therefore leave the writer	to the enjoyment of the unenvied reputation which the personal abuse	he has heaped on us will entitle him to from the low and vulgar herd	to which he belongs.	5.184412091309603
2909. despite woodruff's continuing refusal	to debate with pike through the columns of his newspaper pike	did not let up his attack for a moment.	4.04055018381536
2910. over the months he became a	political gadfly with an incessant barrage of satirical poems ridiculing	woodruff the casca letters belittling woodruff and long	analytical articles vilifying woodruff.	5.322356179857044
2911. so persistent were these attacks	that in march of the following year woodruff was finally moved	to action and pike was to learn his first lesson in frontier politics	the subtle art of diversion.	3.832622071374183
2912. to attack pike directly would	gain woodruff little for as a penniless newcomer pike had nothing	to lose.	5.7586586191099505
2913. by this time woodruff had accurately measured pike as a	man of great personal pride a man who would fly into a towering rage	if his integrity were questioned and who would be anxious to avenge himself.	3.9916985251882737
2914. pike's honor would now come under attack but not by woodruff	himself.	6.093123995732186
2915. the charges would be made in the gazette by an anonymous	correspondent and pike would be so busy trying to track down the	illusive character assassin that he would forget about harassing woodruff.	3.9604428207175952
2916. pike was stunned by the	first blast against his character which was published in the march	4th issue of the gazette under the name vale.	5.224869089335681
2917. the anonymous	correspondent did not resort to innuendoes.	4.641973630080768
2918. he called pike a thief.	9.440802144214619
2919. he said pike had stolen mules from harris during the santa fe	expedition; he accused pike of continuing his sticky-fingered career	in arkansas with the theft of some otter skins in van buren.	3.780093685721391
2920. the	charges caught pike off balance coming as they did from an unexpected	quarter.	6.4070006492367435
2921. outraged he used the advocate of march 7th for a	denial sending immediately to santa fe and van buren for documents	to vindicate himself and demanding that woodruff reveal the name	of this perfidious slanderer who disguised himself under a pastoral pseudonym.	3.3991520292124267
2922. woodruff said nothing and pike frustrated stormed	throughout little rock in an unsuccessful search for vale	asking	his friends to keep their ears open.	5.166589083759069
2923. finally he learned through	the grapevine that the culprit might be one james w robinson in	pope county.	4.490153485231206
2924. without further inquiry pike jumped to the conclusion	that robinson was guilty and following the honorable route that	would	eventually lead to the dueling ground sent a message to robinson	through his friends demanding that he either confirm or deny his complicity.	4.935427227926464
2925. to pike silence was tantamount to an	admission of guilt and he determined to get robinson onto the dueling	ground at all costs.	3.9679490157415294
2926. on april 11th he wrote an open letter in the	advocate making it known to the world that jas w robinson	is by his own admission a base liar and a slanderer.	6.042839112057929
2927. if robinson was a liar and a slanderer he was also	a very canny gentleman for nothing that pike could do would pry so	much as a single word out of him.	3.700262410143056
2928. preoccupied with his own defense and	his attempts to get robinson to fight pike lessened his attacks	on woodruff and finally stopped them altogether.	5.406653260992133
2929. and pike never did	find out if robinson was really responsible for the vale letter.	4.923788276378263
2930. woodruff's strategy had been immensely successful.	7.603896187885215
2931. it	took pike a long time to realize what woodruff had done and it had	a profound effect on him.	4.522576667421259
2932. once he learned a lesson he never forgot it.	7.553490765198951
2933. in the next few months of comparative silence pike waited patiently	until conditions were perfect for a new attack and then displaying	a remarkable grasp of the subtleties of political infighting gained	from his first bout with woodruff he used these changed conditions	to excellent advantage.	3.9221205306087312
2934. shortly after the vale incident	a rift began to develop between william woodruff and governor pope.	6.285132592712004
2935. one-armed gruff frugally honest governor pope had been the	ideal man to assume office in arkansas after the disgraceful antics of	political bosses like crittenden and he ruled the state with an iron	fist tolerating no nonsense.	3.5720114885706145
2936. woodruff had supported him all the way	both as a chief executive and as a man.	6.254115088573344
2937. besides being political allies	they were also friends.	6.007766182155678
2938. this warm relationship came to an abrupt	end in june of 1834 when the national congress appropriated $3000	for compiling and printing the laws of arkansas territory and	taking note of the recent wave of corruption in the legislature left	it to the governor to award the contract.	4.94428966845339
2939. woodruff wanted this	political windfall very badly and everyone assumed that he would get	it because he was a close friend of the governor and his stanchest supporter.	4.97168946973252
2940. after all woodruff owned a competent printing plant and was	the logical man for the job.	6.5389655357189005
2941. but because the governor was determined	that friendship should not influence him one way or the other he looked	for a printer with a knowledge of the law	and awarded the contract to a lawyer named john steele who	had started a newspaper in helena the year before.	4.0113328085290965
2942. considering the governor's act a personal rebuff he aired	his feelings in the gazette on august 26 1834: we think	the governor treated us rather shabbily to say the least of it.	4.840670522698867
2943. h	it is but justice to mr steele for us to add that in the above	remarks nothing is intended to his disparagement either as a lawyer	or as a printer.	4.153823670202989
2944. he got a good fat job and we congratulate him on his	good luck.	6.421893355404489
2945. we hope that he will execute it in a manner that will entitle	him to credit.	6.146215978584141
2946. as summer cooled into fall and winter	even so the relationship between the two men continued to grow colder	by the day and by december of 1834 it was icy.	5.929444195046707
2947. it was at this point	that pike decided to capitalize on the bad feelings between the two	men.	4.688645896885234
2948. the eventual prize in this new battle was the public printing contract	that woodruff still held.	5.259644534345602
2949. from his first bout with the	canny woodruff pike had learned that it was better not to attack him	directly so harping on the theme that the cost of printing was too	high he condemned the governor for permitting such a state of affairs	to exist.	4.141687665826478
2950. to document his charge pike set up two parallel columns	in the advocate showing the price charged by the gazette and	the considerably lower price for which the work could be done elsewhere.	5.254939179935823
2951. then he called on the governor to explain why.	6.130204043814575
2952. the governor	was not used to having his integrity questioned and he promptly	passed the charges on to woodruff demanding that woodruff answer them.	4.765382730065078
2953. if woodruff could not furnish a strong explanation the governor	insisted that he lower his prices in accord with the scale printed in	the advocate.	4.05820566398624
2954. woodruff was now impaled on the horns of a dilemma.	6.289010577019261
2955. as a proud man his prestige would suffer if he let pike dictate	to him through the governor's office but to lower his prices would	be tantamount to an admission that they had been too high in the first	place.	3.9425827183201165
2956. as a consequence he did neither.	9.546820549688729
2957. very angry at woodruff	the governor used his personal influence to have the printing contract	withdrawn from the gazette and awarded to the lowest bidder which	by a strange coincidence happened to be pike's advocate.	3.9546368382226222
2958. and for the moment at least the governor now found himself allied with	the head of the crittenden faction he had formerly opposed and pike	was credited with a clear triumph over woodruff.	6.1155152486691735
2959. but in	the	confused atmosphere of frontier politics alliances were as quickly	broken as they were formed and as pike came to favor with the governor	of the territory the governor fell out of favor with the president	of the united states.	3.773784785561778
2960. on january 28 1835 andrew jackson removed	pope from office and elevated territorial secretary william	s fulton to the position.	5.844457009342636
2961. fulton was a very close friend of jackson	and had been his private secretary for a number of years in the	old days.	4.687204032765891
2962. as a stanch party man and a rabid democrat he had little	tolerance for whigs like pike and pike lost any immediate personal	advantage his victory over woodruff might have gained him.	5.275398597236218
2963. as pike proved himself adept in the political arena he also became	a social lion in the village of little rock where he served as a symbol	of the culture that the ladies of the town were striving so eagerly	to cultivate.	3.7939494249433796
2964. after all pike was an established poet and his work	had been published in the respectable periodicals of that center of	american culture boston.	5.788763692116047
2965. his accomplishments and the fact that he	was resident did much to offset the unkind words travelers used to	describe little rock after a visit there.	4.225294922667909
2966. for some reason none of	them were impressed with the territorial capital.	7.122506522184062
2967. the internationally	known sportsman and traveler friedrich gersta^cker was typical of	its detractors in the mid-thirties.	3.872342767520762
2968. little rock is a vile detestable	place h.	7.254064514539058
2969. little rock is without any flattery	one of the dullest towns in the united states and i would not have	remained two hours in the place if i had not met with some good friends	who made me forget its dreariness.	4.22042623267248
2970. pike enjoyed his	new social position tremendously and cultivated in himself those traits	necessary to its preservation.	5.550554466109728
2971. he was especially popular with women	for like the romantic poetry he wrote he was personally gracious	gallant and chivalrous.	4.263750333702858
2972. he again began to play the violin and tucking	the instrument beneath his chin performed soulful and romantic airs	to match the expressions on the faces of the lovely women who gathered	to hear him.	5.254098226059675
2973. his artistic accomplishments guaranteed him entry into	any social gathering.	5.051301465336303
2974. he composed songs and set them to music and	sang them in a soft melodious voice and when his audience had had enough	of music he would discourse on politics or tell stories of his western	adventures guaranteed to excite the emotions of men and women alike.	4.880732604860364
2975. the bulk of his early reputation however came not from	his poetry or his music but from his excellence as an orator.	3.841083486529009
2976. by 1834	the art of oratory had reached a very high level in the united states	as a literary form.	6.991422076566698
2977. the orator of this period in order to earn a	reputation had to pay close attention to the formal composition of his	speech judging how it would appear in print as well as the effect	it would have on the audience that heard it.	4.011603545412809
2978. very soon after his	arrival in little rock pike had joined one of the most influential	organizations in town the little rock debating society and it	was with this group that he made his debut as an orator being invited	to deliver the annual fourth of july address the club sponsored every	year.	5.119681527856694
2979. samuel gorton founder of warwick was styled by the historian	samuel greene arnold one of the most remarkable men who ever lived.	4.551202605387904
2980. a biographer called him the premature john the baptist of	new england transcendentalism.	5.875779398551443
2981. the historian charles francis	adams called him a crude and half-crazy thinker.	4.232354920347296

3000. she was ellen aldridge a widow	of good repute who was employed by gorton's wife and lived with	the family.	5.849048819743549
3001. the report was:   it had been whispered privately	that she had smiled in the congregation and the governor prence	sent to knoe her business and command after punishment as the bench	see fit her departure and also anyone who brought her to the place	from which she came.	3.567581617563679
3002. gorton said they were preparing to deport	her as a vagabond and to escape the shame she fled to the woods for	several days returning at night.	5.0961062819746985

3009. william coddington who was running the colony felt constrained	to move seven miles south where with others- as mentioned	above- he founded newport.	4.0854589181953385
3010. when in march 1640 the two towns	were united under coddington gorton claimed the union was irregular	and illegally constituted and that it had never been sanctioned by the	majority of freeholders.	5.82835382492753
3011. then he became involved in a ruckus	remarkably similar to the one in plymouth.	5.304194273131964

3021. roger williams wrote his friend winthrop as follows:   master	gorton having foully abused high and low at aquidneck is now	bewitching and bemaddening poor providence both with his unclean and	foul censures of all the ministers of this country	and also denying all visible	and external ordinances in depth of familism: almost all suck in	his poison as at first they did at aquidneck.	3.3547475570482597
3022. some few and myself withstand	his inhabitation and town privileges without confession and	reformation of his uncivil and inhuman practices at portsmouth; yet	the tide is too strong against us and i fear	it will force me to little patience a little isle next	to your prudence.	4.6259082305207

3024. providence finally	managed to get gorton out of the town and he and some friends	bought land at pawtuxet on the west side of narragansett bay five	miles south but still within the jurisdiction of the providence colony.	5.601557356883713
3025. this town should not be confused with pawtucket just north of providence	or pawcatuck connecticut on the pawcatuck river opposite	westerly rhode island.	4.250021896209469
3026. up to now gorton had been looking	for trouble and now that he was trying to get away from it trouble	started looking for him.	6.530900663170692
3027. upon intelligence that the formidable	agitator was to favor them with his presence the benighted inhabitants	of pawtuxet alas gave their allegiance to massachusetts and asked	that colony to expel the newcomers.	3.703107015438254
3028. as it was the custom of that alert	colony to take over the property of persons asking for protection	this was an act roughly equivalent to throwing open the door to a pack	of wolves and saying come and get it.	5.998067047994708
3029. gorton and company	however promptly bought land from miantonomi a few miles south	of pawtuxet extending from the present gaspee point south to warwick	neck and twenty miles inland.	3.799665308260037
3030. the settlement was called shawomet.	6.916348007078764
3031. it was not within the jurisdiction of anybody or anything including	providence and massachusetts.	5.242490004482739
3032. if gorton wanted peace and quiet	for his complicated meditations this is where he should have had it.	5.764863593747593
3033. instead	of that he was engulfed by bedlam.	7.191366239675112
3034. pomham and soconoco	a couple of minor sachems	under miantonomi declared that they had never assented to the sale	of land to gorton and had never received anything for it.	5.227906273290338
3035. following	the glorious lead of the heroes of pawtuxet they also submitted themselves	to the protection of massachusetts.	4.0802693256820675
3036. one historical authority	presents laborious and circuitous testimony tending to arouse suspicion	that massachusetts was behind the clouds settling down on the embattled	gorton.	5.9207257828249755
3037. however the general court at boston ordered	the purchasers of shawomet to appear before them to answer the sachems'	claim.	4.720327875834294
3038. the purchasers rejected the order in two letters written	in vigorous terms.	5.506908456901043
3039. then massachusetts switched to its standard tactics.	5.924988147630529
3040. it pointed out twenty-six instances of blasphemy in the letters	and ordered the writers to submit or force of arms would be used.	5.4456021236288406

3044. at shawomet women	and children fled in terror across the bay.	7.13185789585596
3045. the men fortified a blockhouse	and got ready to fight but meanwhile appealed to the king and	again tried to arbitrate.	4.148084628664546
3046. gorton evidently still had plenty to learn	about massachusetts but he was learning fast.	6.568686106420281
3047. governor winthrop wrote:	you may do well to take notice that besides the title	to land between the english and the indians there there are twelve	of the english that have subscribed their names to horrible and detestable	blasphemies who are rather to be judged as blasphemous than	they should delude us by winning time under pretence of arbitration.	3.5248004784242473
3048. the attack started on october 2 1643 and the gortonists held	out for a day and a night.	5.116677724306203
3049. the attackers sent for more soldiers and	the defenders to save bloodshed surrendered under the promise that	they would be treated as neighbors.	3.6282179734657203
3050. promptly their livestock was taken	and according to gorton the soldiers were ordered to knock down anyone	who should utter a word of insolence and run through anyone who	might step out of line.	4.974764829627616
3051. when the captives arrived in boston	the chaplain of their captors went to prayers in the open streets	that the people might take notice what they had done in a holy manner	and in the name of the lord.	4.133517685701264
3052. gorton and ten of his friends	were thrown in jail.	6.737739267777016
3053. on sunday they refused to attend church.	6.2961269734829965
3054. the magistrates were determined to compel them.	6.235817153065196
3055. the prisoners agreed	provided they might speak after the sermon which was permitted.	4.012715720819275
3056. here	was gorton's chance to indulge in something at which he was supreme.	7.015240411539089
3057. the boston elders were great at befuddling the opposition with	torrents of ecclesiastical obscurities but gorton was better.	3.71780471901309
3058. reverend	cotton preached to them about demetrius and the shrines of ephesus.	6.169366629926394
3059. gorton replied with blasts that scandalized the congregation.	5.066959048406199
3060. at the trial which took place later the pomham matter was completely	omitted.	7.175532562860366
3061. the gortonists were charged with blasphemy and tried	for their lives.	4.345175156411953
3062. four ecclesiastical questions were presented by the	general court to gorton:  whether the fathers who	died before christ was born of the virgin mary were justified and	saved only by the blood which hee shed and the death which hee suffered	after his incarnation?	5.157792092531187
3063.   whether the only price of our	redemption were not the death of christ on the cross with the rest	of his sufferings and obediences in the time of his life here after	hee was born of the virgin mary?	4.870041662194327
3064.   who was the god whom hee	thinke we serve?	8.250194208795612
3065.   what hee means when hee saith wee worship	the starre of our god remphan chion moloch?	4.480939804338596
3066.    gorton	answered in writing.	10.109203984689895
3067. all of the elders except three voted for death	but a majority of the deputies refused to sanction the sentence.	4.992357796384788
3068. seven of the prisoners were sentenced to be confined in irons for as	long as it pleased the court set to work and if they broke jail or proclaimed	heresy to be executed if convicted.	5.0836603881400295
3069. the three others got off	easier.	6.247587309543374
3070. the convicts were put in chains paraded before the congregation	at the reverend cotton's lecture as an example and sent to	prisons in various towns where they languished all winter chains included.	4.778348141687949
3071. when fred wheeled him back into his room the big one looking out on	the back porch and put him to bed papa told him he was very tired	but that he had enjoyed greatly the trip downtown.	3.8206783594063225
3072. i've been cooped	up so long he added.	7.325669612655319
3073. getting out again seeing old friends	had given his spirits a lift.	4.751063681881455
3074. that night after supper i went	back over to 48 spruce street- ralph and i at that time were living	at 168 chestnut- and ralph went with me.	5.339188063377607
3075. papa was still elated	over his afternoon visit downtown.	5.066959048406199
3076. baby i saw a lot of old friends	i hadn't seen in a long time he told me his eyes bright.	7.153629105808629
3077. it was mighty good for the old man to get out again.	6.3060903166264595
3078. the	next day he seemed to be in fairly good shape and still in excellent	spirits.	8.40343234164618
3079. but a few days after fred's return he began hemorrhaging	and that was the beginning of early and complete disintegration.	5.771366774505287
3080. it	began in the morning and very quickly the hemorrhage was a massive one.	6.575359034265019
3081. we got dr glenn to him as quickly as we could and we wired	tom of papa's desperate condition.	4.560248169288388
3082. the hemorrhage was in the prostate	region; dr glenn saw at once what had happened.	5.902752243342897
3083. he	has lost much blood he said.	5.72298692788124
3084. it'll take a lot to replace	it.	7.603896187885215
3085. dr glenn i've got a lot of blood fred	spoke up plenty of it.	5.566332791178955
3086. let me give papa blood.	10.784321062315966
3087. the doctor	agreed but explained that it would be necessary first to check fred's	blood to ascertain whether or not it was of the same type as	papa's.	4.759219483611758
3088. to give a patient the wrong type of blood said the doctor	would likely kill him.	6.364061147754911
3089. that was in the days before blood banks	of course and transfusions had to be given directly from donor to	patient.	5.926936778040318
3090. one had to find a donor and usually very quickly whose blood	corresponded with the patient's.	6.726408138701098
3091. and then it took considerably	longer to make preparations for giving transfusions.	5.2302092436352
3092. they had to take	blood samples to the laboratory to test them for one thing and there	was much required preliminary procedure.	6.223240975015464
3093. they made the tests	and came to fred; by now it was perhaps two days or longer after papa	had begun hemorrhaging.	4.003416794972568
3094. fred your blood matches your	father's all right dr glenn said.	6.289010577019261
3095. but we aren't going	to let you give him any.	5.871496550192596
3096. but why in the name of god can't	i give my father blood?	8.05308872680115
3097.  fred demanded.	8.815314306294878
3098. why can't i	doctor?	13.042936042405747
3099.    because fred it could do him no good.	6.098174584701973
3100. he's past helping.	10.109203984689895
3101. he's as good as gone.	7.359720370798318
3102. and in a few minutes papa was dead.	12.883068489095248
3103. it was well past midnight.	7.178034448479123
3104. papa had left us about the same hour of the night that ben had passed	on.	6.422488609004581
3105. the date was june 20 1922.	4.863301205549233
3106. w o wolfe	prominent business man and pioneer resident of this section died shortly	after midnight tuesday at his home 48 spruce street the asheville	times of wednesday june 21 announced.	5.064128347056854
3107. mr wolfe	had been in declining health for many years and death was not unexpected.	5.158149590679403
3108. funeral services were	held thursday afternoon at four o'clock at the home.	6.604254559426578
3109. beloved dr	r f campbell our first presbyterian church pastor was	in charge.	4.750266544742033
3110. the burial was out in riverside cemetery.	6.235817153065196
3111. all about him	stood tombstones his own sensitive great hands had fashioned.	5.021690868848617
3112. a few years before his death papa had agreed with mama to make a	joint will with her in which it would be provided that in the event of	the	death of either of them an accounting would be made to their children	whereby each child would receive a bequest of $5000 cash.	5.911252414308131
3113. at his death	fred and ralph my husband were named executors of the estate under	the terms of the will.	4.60332642784665
3114. fred and ralph qualified as executors	and paid off what debts were currently due and they were all current	since papa was never one to allow bills to go unpaid.	4.976531511707395
3115. the bills	were principally for hospitalization and doctors' fees during the	last years of his life and when he died he owed in the main only current	doctor's bills.	3.95444872732929
3116. after they had paid all his debts and the funeral	costs ralph and fred had some fourteen thousand dollars as i remember	with which to pay the bequests.	5.448939291857821
3117. this manifestly would not	provide $5000 to each of the surviving five children.	5.093059003710095
3118. so what	fred and ralph did was to attempt to prorate the money fairly by taking	into account what each of the five had received if anything from	the estate before papa's death.	5.60912554745942
3119. consequently fred and tom the	two who had been provided college educations signed statements to the	effect that each had received his bequest in full and effie and i	were each allotted $5000.	3.7960405847952714
3120. frank had been given about half his legacy	to use in a business venture before papa's death; he was given the	difference between that amount and $5000.	5.308545006705692
3121. tom had received four years	of education at the university of north carolina and two at harvard	and fred had been in and out of georgia tech and carneigie	tech and part of the time had been a self-help student.	4.983105883456678
3122. so because	he had received less than tom it was felt proper that fred should receive	the few hundred dollars that remained.	5.618459389024767
3123. and that's how papa's	estate was divided.	6.140975530292167
3124. papa i should emphasize had been an	invalid the last several years of his life; his hospital and doctor	bills had been large and his income had been cut until he was receiving	little except	small rentals on some properties he still owned.	4.656407910587838
3125. had	he been able to escape this long siege of invalidism i'm convinced	papa would have left a sizable estate.	4.442182400367692
3126. but he had succeeded well	we agreed.	10.83730323381957
3127. he had left us a legacy far more valuable than houses and lands	and stocks and bonds.	4.511317923472047
3128. for years papa and mama had been large	taxpayers.	7.779003926597658
3129. i recall that several years their taxes exceeded $800.	5.329910019753156
3130. in those years of lower property valuations and lower tax rates that	payment represented ownership of much property.	5.972123962051279
3131. merciful god	julia! i have known papa to exclaim on getting his tax bill	we're going to the dogs!   but he never expected to	do that.	3.804377817223924
3132. and he didn't by a long shot!	in the spring	of his second year at harvard tom had been offered a job at northwestern	university as an instructor in the english department.	5.244994002040909
3133. but	he had delayed accepting this job and as he was leaving to come home	to papa in response to our telegram he dropped a postcard to miss	mccrady head of the harvard appointment office asking her please	to write northwestern authorities and explain the circumstances.	3.8195794363042883
3134. actually tom had been postponing giving them an answer i'm	confident because he did not want to go out there to teach.	6.6252350063381895
3135. in fact	he didn't want to teach anywhere.	5.661997496801337
3136. he wanted to go back to harvard	for another year of playwriting.	7.588737716019504
3137. but papa's death had further complicated	the financing of tom's hoped-for third year and for the	weeks following it tom did not know whether his return to harvard could	be arranged.	3.860487495405849
3138. but things were worked out in the family and	late in august he wrote miss mccrady an explanatory letter in which	he told her that matters at home had been in an unsettled condition	after papa's death and he had not known whether he would stay at home	with mama accept the northwestern job or return to harvard.	5.125349125304333
3139. but	he was happy to tell her that his finances were now in such condition	that he could go back to harvard for a third year with professor	baker.	3.888363460138618
3140. and that's what he did.	8.962432341310402
3141. that third year he wrote plays	with a fury.	5.781835116162867
3142. i believe there are seventeen short plays by tom now	housed in the houghton library at harvard; i think i'm right	in that figure.	5.542503219433728
3143. that fall he submitted to professor baker the first	acts and outlines of the following acts of several plays six of them	according to some of his associates and he also worked on a play	that he first called niggertown the material for which he had collected	during the summer at home.	3.795309802070072
3144. later this play would be called welcome	to our city.	7.523228681090275
3145. in the spring it must have been he began	working on the play that he called the house which later would	be mannerhouse.	4.752096104246133
3146. that spring welcome to our city was selected	for production by the 47 workshop and it was staged in the middle	of may.	5.963147392151281
3147. it ran two nights and though it was generally praised there	was considerable criticism of its length.	4.605482450068564
3148. it ran until past one o'clock.	8.910414979842207
3149. that was tom's weakness; it was demonstrated many critics	would later point out in the length of his novels.	5.304770356797924
3150. in this play	there were so many characters and so much detail.	6.994557772635794
3151. tom never knew how	to condense to boil down.	5.126318052694577
3152. he was always concerned with life and he	tried to picture it whole; he wanted nothing compressed tight.	5.83243618682368
3153. he	was a big man and he wanted nothing little squeezed; he despised parsimony	and particularly of words.	4.314496425238596
3154. in this play there were some thirty	or more named characters and i don't know how many more unnamed.	6.087490579382843
3155. in describing it to professor baker after it had been chosen for	production he defended his great array of characters by declaring that	he had included that many not because i didn't know how to save	paint but because the play required them.	3.8165216181006922
3156. and he threatened someday	to write a play with fifty eighty a hundred people- a whole	town a whole race a whole epoch.	5.673710925339532
3157. he said he would do it though	probably nobody would produce it for his own soul's ease and	comfort.	5.442417647772757
3158. that summer tom attended the summer session at harvard	but he did not ask mama to send him back in the fall.	6.298868308775226
3159. instead	he went down to new york and submitted welcome to our city	to the theatre guild which had asked him to let them have a look at	it after professor baker had recommended it highly.	4.014545302417744
3160. he hung around	new york waiting to hear whether they would accept it for production	and in that time came down to asheville and also paid a short visit	to chapel hill where with almost childish delight he visited old	friends and favorite campus spots.	4.704694380915968
3161. on returning to new york he had	a job for several weeks; it was visiting university of north carolina	alumni in new york to ask them for contributions to the graham	memorial building fund.	4.382511851904762
3162. the graham memorial would be the campus	student union honoring the late and much beloved edward kidder graham	who had been president when tom entered the university.	4.938392534063939
3163. well	the theatre guild kept that play and kept it and finally in	december they turned it down.	4.060235568763422
3164. but they would reconsider it they assured	him if he would rewrite it.	7.388105336311595
3165. tom told me about it how one evening	he went over to see the theatre guild man.	4.571129292549207
3166. this man tom said	had the play shut up in his desk i believe and when tom sat down	he pulled it out and apologetically told tom that they wouldn't be	able to use it.	4.750632983387031
3167. tom said he almost burst into tears he was so	disappointed and put out.	4.340955989475082
3168. the man tom said explained that it was	not only too long and detailed but that as it stood it wasn't the sort	of thing the public wanted.	5.193489056698431
3169. the public tom said the man told him	wanted realism and his play wasn't that.	4.206876449408423
3170. it was fantastic writing	beautiful writing the man declared but the public he insisted	wanted realism.	6.143231728954649
3171. tom was not willing to revise the play according	to the plan the man suggested.	4.3808793264079275
3172. such a revision he said would ruin	it would change his whole conception of the play as well as the treatment.	7.480415250921161
3173. he thought about it and he told the man he just couldn't do	it over in accordance with the suggestions he had made.	4.441336415714849
3174. it was not until we had returned to the city to live while i	was still at brown and sharpe's that i felt the full impact of	evangelical christianity.	6.099358708959267
3175. i came under the spell of a younger group	in the church led by the pastor's older son.	4.392802695642228
3176. the spirit of this group	was that we were- and are- living in a world doomed to eternal	punishment but that god through jesus christ has provided a way of	escape for those who confess their sins and accept salvation.	5.404804964430387
3177. there are millions who accept this doctrine but few indeed are those	who accept it so truly that the fate of humanity lies as a weight on	their souls night and day.	3.791432417810855
3178. this group in park place church was made	up of the earnest few.	6.434716583370657
3179. i was drawn deeper and deeper into these concerns	and responsibilities.	5.494465035871686
3180. i engaged more and more in religious activities.	8.746086630518008
3181. besides church and sunday school i went to out-of-door meetings	on the sidewalk at the church door.	4.792087894905629
3182. i went to an afternoon service	at the ymca.	7.787508331059062
3183. i went to the christian endeavor society	and to the evening service of the church.	5.576646679440264
3184. much of this lacked the active	support of the pastor.	8.363669038540129
3185. the young people were self-energizing and	i was energized.	5.090651494216819
3186. once or twice my father asked me if i wasn't overdoing	a bit in my churchgoing.	6.866761971584985
3187. meanwhile i myself was not yet	saved.	6.519471041259754
3188. at least i had been unable to lay hold on the experience of	conversion.	8.078782885406378
3189. try as i might to confess my sins and accept salvation	no answer came to me from heaven.	4.249947533099043
3190. finally after years i gave up.	8.850537400058892
3191. the basic difficulty i suppose was in my ultimate inability	to feel a burden of sin from which i sought relief.	3.8351726575853062
3192. i was familiar	with pilgrim's progress which i read as literature.	7.38101550072991
3193. no load	of sin had been laid on my shoulders nor did earnest effort enable	me to become conscious of one.	4.197077182000053
3194. there is of course the doctrine	of original sin which asserts that each of us as individuals partakes	of the guilt of our first ancestor.	6.469349908401808
3195. in the rhyming catechism this	doctrine is worded thus: in adam's fall we sin-ned all.	4.491608244697973
3196. this doctrine was repugnant to my moral sense.	7.006468312365853
3197. i did not feel	it presumptuous to expect that the creator would be at least as just	as the most righteous of his creatures; and the doctrine of original	sin is compounded of injustice.	4.2785217212353235
3198. some of these thoughts- not	all of them- have taken organized form in later years.	7.161348324248021
3199. the actual	impelling force which severed me from evangelical effort was of another	sort.	4.012715720819275
3200. i became disgusted at being so preoccupied with the state of	my own miserable soul.	6.403296384566903
3201. i found myself becoming one of that group of	people who in carlyle's words are forever gazing into their own	navels anxiously asking 'am i right am i wrong'?	3.8861917196445948
3202.  i bethought	me of the lord's prayer and these words came to mind:	thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.	5.9698741586995325
3203. they have remained on the opened page of my mind in all the years	which since have passed.	5.057420142130115
3204. from that time to this my religious concern	is that i might give effective help to the bringing in of god's kingdom	on earth.	5.987673780308409
3205. i do not claim to be free from sin or from the	need for repentance and forgiveness.	5.181680365747376
3206. in my experience the assurance	of forgiveness comes only when i have confessed to the wronged one and	have made as full reparation as i can devise.	5.527418688435607
3207. there was one	further step in my religious progress.	6.258313152663066
3208. this was taken after i came	to live in springfield and it was made under the guidance of the reverend	raymond beardslee a young preacher who came to the congregational	church there at about the same time that i moved from new york.	6.256175532518969
3209. his father was a professor at hartford theological seminary	and from him he acquired a conviction which he passed along to me that	there is in the universe of persons a moral law the law of love	which is a natural law in the same sense as is the physical law.	4.1222342081169225
3210. it is most important that we recognize the law of love as being unbreakable	in all personal relationships whether individually socially	or as between whole nations of people.	5.444056851110989
3211. if obeyed the law brings order	and satisfaction.	6.104300698969425
3212. if disobeyed the result is turmoil and chaos.	8.986373121078701
3213. as we observe moral law and physical law they appear as being inevitable.	5.055942905274708
3214. we can conceive of no alternatives.	9.769713138526479
3215. their basis seems deeper	than mere authority.	6.30200556666719
3216. they are not true because scientists or prophets	say they are true.	7.705679504165878
3217. it is not the authority of god himself which	makes them true.	6.554958870270844
3218. because god is what he is the laws of the universe	material and spiritual are what they are.	7.49322454841313
3219. deity and law are one	and inseparable.	5.66037853959279
3220. with this conviction the partition between	the sacred and the secular disappears.	7.254161806541072
3221. one's daily work becomes sacred	since it is performed in the field of influence of the moral law	dealing as it does with people as well as with matter and energy.	4.628310382141077
3222. in his book civilization and ethics albert schweitzer faces	the moral problems which arise when moral law is recognized in business	life for example.	5.548795914044911
3223. his ethics defines possessions as the	property of the community of which the individual is sovereign steward.	5.091294141908964
3224. one serves society by conducting a business from which a certain	number of employees draw their means of subsistence; another by giving	away his property in order to help his fellow man.	5.467367721219895
3225. each will decide	on his own course somewhere between these two extreme cases according	to the sense of responsibility which is determined for him by the particular	circumstances of his own life.	4.538605086542696
3226. no one is to judge others.	9.696573988794558
3227. he is uncompromising in assigning guilt to the man who finds	it necessary to inflict or permit injury to one individual or group for	the sake of a larger good.	4.390502941426409
3228. for this decision a man must take personal	responsibility.	9.26099481311747
3229. says he i may never imagine that in the struggle	between personal and supra-personal responsibility it is possible	to make a compromise between the ethical and the purposive in the shape	of a relative ethic; or to let the ethical be superseded by the purposive.	3.823010119927287
3230. on the contrary it is my duty to make my own decision as between	the two.	6.510821189137248
3231. schweitzer seems in fact to acquire for himself	a burden of sin not bequeathed by adam but accumulated in the	inevitable judgments which life requires of him as between greater and	lesser responsibilities.	3.639205016492041
3232. this viewpoint i find interesting but it	has never weighed on my soul.	6.0984868698249555
3233. my own experience	has followed simpler lines.	6.720614088415732
3234. an uncompromising belief in the	moral law has the advantage of making religion natural even as physical	law is natural.	5.886593117748815
3235. neither the engineer nor the ordinary citizen feels	any self-consciousness in obeying the laws of matter and energy	nor can he achieve a sense of self-righteousness in such obedience.	4.379527607223229
3236. to	obey the moral law is just ordinary common sense applied to a neglected	field.	5.7836982265615156
3237. religion thus becomes integrated with life.	5.66037853959279
3238. this	truth that the moral law is natural has other important corollaries.	6.271761924212877
3239. one	of them is that it gives meaning and purpose to life.	5.939449679244262
3240. in seeking	for such meaning and purpose albert schweitzer seized upon the concept	of the sacredness of life.	5.7941837129681915
3241. it is puzzling to the occidental	mind to assign sacredness to animal insect	and plant life.	4.498281303525328
3242. these lives are in themselves outside of the moral order	and are unburdened with moral responsibility.	6.3103453146047
3243. there is indeed a	moral responsibility on man himself for his own soul's sake to respect	lower life and to avoid the infliction of suffering but this viewpoint	schweitzer rejects.	4.162612258435412
3244. so far as sacredness inheres	in any aspect of creation it seems to me to be found in human personality	whether in lambarene africa or in washington dc.	7.174172826245802
3245. one	cannot read the records of scientists officials and travelers who	have penetrated to the minds of the most savage races without realizing	that each individual met with is a person.	4.219605682046382
3246. read for instance	in	malcolm macdonald's borneo people of segura and her wise	father tomonggong koh and her final adjustment to encroaching civilization.	5.382017893995106
3247. above all read in jens bjerre's the last cannibals	how the old man of the wailbri tribe in central australia	gave to the white man his choicest possession while the tears	streamed down his face.	3.795654887573875
3248. the australian aborigine is the conventional	exemplar of degraded humanity; yet here was a depth of sensibility	which is lacking in a considerable portion of the beneficiaries of our	civilization.	5.519260191421629
3249. persons whether white black brown or yellow	are a concern of god.	4.582748142992266
3250. respect for personality is a privilege and a	duty for us as brothers.	5.926734816808145
3251. such is the field for exercising our	reverence.	6.745892607586105
3252. as to our action let us align ourselves with the purpose	expressed by jesus in the lord's prayer: thy kingdom come	thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.	5.8316077162197475
3253. with the knowledge	that the kingdom comes by obedience to the moral law in our relations	with all people we have a firm intellectual grasp on both the means	and the ends of our lives.	4.045320069018413
3254. this intellectual approach to spiritual	life suited me well because i was never content to lead a divided	life.	5.572840681476728
3255. as i have said words from tennyson remain ever in my memory:	that mind and soul according well may make one music as	before.	4.346046171573265
3256. let us now give some thought to the soul.	8.067005824596723
3257. when the	young biologist dr ballard began to show interest in our daughter	elizabeth this induced a corresponding interest on our part in	him.	4.24701625740037
3258. i asked one day what he was doing.	8.309750827852783
3259. he told me that he had a big	newt and a little newt and that he was transplanting a big eye of the	big newt onto the little newt and a little eye of the little newt onto	the big newt.	4.773908137588218
3260. he was then noting that the big eye on the little newt	hung back until the little eye had grown up to it while the little	eye on the big newt grew rapidly until it was as big as the other.	5.2636177095394014
3261. then	i asked what does that teach you?	5.3285636594893
3262.  said he it teaches	me to wonder.	8.72098442062186
3263. this was a profound statement.	8.730502292033032
3264. in the face	of the unfolding universe our ultimate attitude is that of wonder.	7.01298661708028
3265. wonder is indeed the intellectual gateway to the spiritual world.	4.828879462330408
3266. gone are the days when in the nineteenth century scientists thought	that they were close to the attainment of complete knowledge of	the physical universe.	5.95946824247707
3267. for them only a little more needed to be learned	and then all physical knowledge could be neatly sorted packaged	and put in the inventory to be drawn on for the solution of any human	problem.	3.932729589690625
3268. this complacency was blown to bits by the relativity	of einstein the revelation of the complex anatomy of the atom and the	discovery of the expanding universe.	5.403589730670439
3269. none of these discoveries were	neatly rounded off bits of knowledge.	5.509296726670125
3270. each faded out into the unexplored	areas of the future.	8.280065330051823
3271. it is as if we in our center of human	observation from time to time penetrate more deeply into the unknown.	4.636869069878175
3272. as our radius of penetration r increases the area of new	knowledge	increases by f and the total of human knowledge becomes measured	in terms of f.	5.5673897119603675
3273. there are	some people intelligent people who seem to be untouched by the sea	of wonder in which we are immersed and in which we spend our lives.	5.019780189749844
3274. one	such is abraham meyer the writer of a recent book speaking of	man.	5.926734816808145
3275. this is a straightforward denial of the spiritual world and	a vigorous defense of pure materialism.	5.003811530657432
3276. his inability to wonder vitiates	his argument.	8.004567697319777
3277. the subject of immortality brings to mind a	vivid incident which took place in 1929 at montreux in switzerland.	4.280795158478855
3278. criticism is as old as literary art and we can set the stage for	our study of three moderns if we see how certain critics in the past	have dealt with the ethical aspects of literature.	4.792035407416498
3279. i have chosen five	contrasting pairs ten men in all and they are arranged in roughly	chronological order.	5.0944731387298
3280. such a list must naturally be selective and the	treatment of each man is brief for i am interested only in their general	ideas on the moral measure of literature.	5.299983006039738
3281. altogether the list	will give us considerable variety in attitudes and some typical ones	for these critics range all the way from censors to those who consider	art above ethics all the way from plato to poe.	4.282726527185676
3282. and most of the	great periods are represented because we will compare plato and aristotle	from the golden age of greece; stephen gosson and sir philip	sidney from renaissance england; dr johnson and william	hazlitt of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in england;	and james russell lowell and edgar allan poe of nineteenth	century american letters.	4.780013495446902
3283. plato and aristotle	agree on some vital literary issues.	5.066959048406199
3284. they both measure literature	by moral standards and in their political writings both allow for	censorship but the differences between them are also significant.	5.446934471836395
3285. while	aristotle censors literature only for the young plato would banish	all poets from his ideal state.	4.580037199729934
3286. even more important in his poetics	aristotle differs somewhat from plato when he moves in the	direction of treating literature as a unique thing separate and apart	from its causes and its effects.	5.1214991813028465
3287. all through the republic	plato attends to the way art relates to the general life and ultimately	to a good life for his citizens.	4.391698583423013
3288. in short he is constantly concerned	with the ethical effects.	7.4825330960806875
3289. when he discusses the subject matter	of poetry he asks what moral effect the scenes will have.	4.6472563917384395
3290. when he	turns briefly to literary style in the third book he again looks to	the effect on the audience.	6.413392260982865
3291. he explains that his citizens must not	be corrupted by any of the misrepresentations of the gods or heroes that	one finds in much poetry and he observes that all these pantomimic	gentlemen will be sent to another state.	3.734338770255549
3292. only those story tellers	will remain who can imitate the style of the virtuous.	7.338090176312285
3293. plato is at times just as suspicious of the poets themselves as he	is of their work.	4.060235568763422
3294. when he discusses tyrants in the eighth book of	the republic he pictures the poets as willing to praise the worst	rulers.	5.98132624225119
3295. but the most fundamental objection he has to poets appears	in the tenth book and it is derived from his doctrine of ideal forms.	4.703169138997952
3296. in plato's mind there is an irresolvable conflict between the	poet and the philosopher because the poet imitates only particular objects	and is incapable of rising to the first level of abstraction much	less the highest level of ideal forms.	5.36014387399012
3297. true reality of course is	the ideal and the poet knows nothing of this; only the philosopher	knows the truth.	4.231598536837979
3298. poets moreover dwell on human passions.	7.603896187885215
3299. and	with this point about the passions we encounter plato's dualism.	4.906390295621099
3300. the same sort of thinking plays so large a part in both babbitt and	more that we must examine it in some detail.	5.380228302358514
3301. plato feels that man	has two competing aspects his rational faculty and his irrational.	4.305414028832856
3302. we can be virtuous only if we control our lower natures the passions	in this case and strengthen our rational side; and poetry with all	its emphasis on the passions encourages the audience to give way to	emotion.	5.117284791032348
3303. for this reason then poetry tends to weaken the power of	control the reason because it tempts one to indulge his passions and	even the best of men he maintains may be corrupted by this subtle	influence.	3.917157182718051
3304. plato's attitude toward poetry has always been something	of an enigma because he is so completely sensitive to its charm.	5.877459455548001
3305. his whole objection indeed seems to rise out of a deep conviction	that the poets do have great power to influence but plato seldom	pays any attention to what might be called the poem itself.	3.850835463072484
3306. he is	rather concerned with the effect on society and he wants the poets	to join his fight for justice.	5.891187099460593
3307. he wants them to use their great power	to strengthen man's rational side to teach virtue and to encourage	religion.	4.379210765703688
3308. while plato finally allows a few acceptable hymns	to the gods and famous men still he clearly leaves the way open for	further discussion of the issue.	5.374574317809449
3309. he even calls upon the poets to defend	the muse and to show that poetry may contribute to virtue.	4.475186970676277
3310. he says:	we	may further grant to those of her poetry's defenders	who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to	speak in prose on her behalf: let them show not only that she is pleasant	but also useful to states and to human life and we will listen	in a kindly spirit; for if this can be proved we shall surely be the	gainers- i mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight.	5.1022569816716965
3311. when we turn to aristotle's ideas on the moral measure	of literature it is at once apparent that he is at times equally concerned	about the influence of the art.	5.278372583676749
3312. in the ideal state for instance	he argues that the young citizens should hear only the most carefully	selected tales and stories.	5.414358490104032
3313. for this reason he would banish indecent	pictures and speeches from the stage; and the young people should	not even be permitted to see comedies till they are old enough to	drink strong wine and sit at the public tables.	3.76525606628688
3314. by the time they reach	that age however aristotle no longer worries about the evil influence	of comedies.	6.918326956803356
3315. in aristotle's analysis of tragedy in the	poetics we find an attempt to isolate the art to consider only	those things proper to it to discover how it differs from other arts	and to deal with the effects peculiar to it.	3.7743457030995953
3316. he assures us early	in the poetics that all art is imitation and that all imitation	gives pleasure but he distinguishes between art in general and	poetic art on the basis of the means manner and the objects of the	imitation.	5.003752567859739
3317. once the poetic arts are separated from the other forms	he lays down his famous definition of tragedy which sets up standards	and so lends direction to the remainder of the work.	4.219223697049806
3318. a tragedy by	his definition is an imitation of an action that is serious of a certain	magnitude and complete in itself.	5.297397085976045
3319. it should have a dramatic form	with pleasing language and it should portray incidents which so arouse	pity and fear that it purges these emotions in the audience.	4.277920058092467
3320. any	tragedy he maintains has six elements: plot character and thought	diction and melody	and spectacle.	5.7836982265615156
3321. throughout the rest of	the poetics aristotle continues to discuss the characteristics	of these six	parts and their interrelationship and he refers frequently to the	standards suggested by his definition of tragedy.	3.7971062092208756
3322. aristotle's	method in the poetics then does suggest that we should isolate	the work.	6.213935377483652
3323. the chicago contingent of modern critics follow aristotle	so far in this direction that it is hard to see how they can compare	one poem with another for the purpose of evaluation.	4.617395516189554
3324. but there are	however several features of aristotle's approach which open the	way for the moral measure of literature.	6.149108086597881
3325. for one thing aristotle mentions	that plays may corrupt the audience.	5.782485497496151
3326. in addition his definition	of a tragedy invites our attention because a serious and important	action may very well be one that tests the moral fiber of the author	or of the characters.	5.177846037127482
3327. and there is one other point in the poetics that	invites moral evaluation: aristotle's notion that the distinctive	function of tragedy is to purge one's emotions by arousing pity	and fear.	4.654998245467542
3328. he rejects certain plots because they do not contribute to	that end.	7.225874483627073
3329. the point is that an ethical critic with an assist from freud	can seize on this theory to argue that tragedy provides us with	a harmless outlet for our hostile urges.	3.5870402947016515
3330. in his study samuel johnson	joseph wood krutch takes this line when he says that what aristotle	really means by his theory of catharsis is that our evil passions	may be so purged by the dramatic ritual that it is less likely	that we shall indulge them through our own acts.	5.326837456623383
3331. in krutch's view	this is one way to show how literature may be moral in effect without	employing the explicit methods of a moralist.	4.036099356652216
3332. and we can add that	krutch's interpretation of purgation is also one answer to plato's	fear that poetry will encourage our passions.	5.413583039193916
3333. if krutch is correct	tragedy may have quite the opposite effect.	5.209175687629041
3334. it may allay our passions	and so restore the rule of reason.	7.842150027673237
3335. or in more freudian terms	the experience may serve to sublimate our destructive urges and strengthen	the ego and superego.	4.342869806451521
3336. the second half of	the sixteenth century in england was the setting for a violent and long	controversy over the moral quality of renaissance literature especially	the drama.	5.443414006004779
3337. no one suggested that the ethical effects of the art	were irrelevant.	5.993624083526378
3338. both sides agreed that the theater must stand a moral	test but they could not agree on whether the poets were a good or	a bad influence.	5.340087863901841
3339. both sides claimed that plato and aristotle supported	their cause.	5.687553722988015
3340. those who wanted to close the theaters for example	pointed to plato's republic and those who wished to keep them	open called on the plato of the ion to testify in their behalf.	5.394652458157645
3341. the most famous document that comes out of this dispute is perhaps	sir philip sidney's an apologie for poetrie published	in 1595.	4.2468272321460905
3342. many students of literature know that classical defense.	7.777761794522012
3343. what is not so well known however and what is quite important for	understanding the issues of this early quarrel is the kind of attack	on literature that sidney was answering.	4.681908861265664
3344. for this reason then i want	to describe first two examples of the puritanical attacks: stephen	gosson's the school of abuse 1579 and his later playes	confuted published in 1582.	5.367865354616144
3345. second we will see how sidney	answered the charges for while sidney's essay was not specifically	a reply to gosson his arguments do support the new theater.	3.900979973960823
3346. according to william ringler's study stephen gosson the theater	business in london had become a thriving enterprise by 1577 and	in the opinion of many a thoroughly bad business.	5.649419826738079
3347. aroused by what	they considered an evil influence some members of the clergy joined	by city authorities merchants and master craftsmen began the attack	on the plays and the actors for what they called the abuses of the	art but by 1582 some of them began to denounce the whole idea of	acting.	3.6819579023773277
3348. although this kind of wholesale objection came at first from	some men who were not technically puritans still once the puritans	gained power they climaxed the affair by passing the infamous ordinance	of 1642 which decreed that all public stage-plays shall cease	and be forborne.	5.073199805058859
3349. with that act of parliament the opponents of the	stage won the day and for more than two decades after that england	had no legitimate public drama.	4.5048534380222165
3350. in the early days of this controversy	over the theater one of the interested parties stephen gosson	published a little tract in which he objected mildly to the abuses	of art rather than the art itself.	6.282871546160502
3351. but his opposition hardened and	by 1579 in the school of abuse he was ready to banish all players.	4.83989198035766
3352. he advises women to beware of those places which in sorrows	cheere you and beguile you in mirth.	5.492354458064573
3353. he does not really approve	of levity and laughter but sex is the deadly sin.	5.030535208430047
3354. he warns that	a single glance can lead us into temptation for looking eies have	lyking hartes and lyking hartes may burne in lust.	5.145523245211424
3355. but it would not be very satisfactory to leave our conclusions	at the point just reached.	5.865912026486811
3356. fortunately it is possible to be somewhat	more concrete and factual in diagnosing the involvement of values in	education.	6.9807705414827765
3357. for this purpose we now draw upon data from sociological and	psychological studies of students in american colleges and universities	and particularly from the cornell values studies.	4.005664468781113
3358. in the latter	research program	information is available for 2758 cornell students	surveyed in 1950 and for 1571 students surveyed in 1952.	5.491506627396357
3359. of the	latter sample 944 persons had been studied two years earlier; hence	changes in attitudes and values can be analyzed for identical individuals	at two points in time.	3.8910754281276856
3360. in addition the 1952 study collected	comparable data from 4585 students at ten other colleges and universities	scattered across the country: dartmouth harvard yale wesleyan	north carolina fisk texas university of california at	los angeles wayne and michigan.	5.005444413856574
3361. we find in the first	place that the students overwhelmingly approve of higher education	positively evaluate the job their own institution is doing do not	accept most of the criticisms levelled against higher education in the	public prints and on the whole approve of the way their university	deals with value-problems and value inculcation.	4.197239120243978
3362. it is not our impression	that these evaluations are naively uncritical resultants of blissful	ignorance; rather the generality of these students find their	university experience congenial to their own sense of values.	5.780785063496033
3363. students	are approximately equally divided between those who regard	vocational preparation as the primary goal of an ideal education and those	who chose a general liberal education.	3.912443383382327
3364. other conceivable goals	such as character-education and social adjustment are of secondary	importance to them.	6.241969334573802
3365. the ideal of a liberal education impresses itself	upon the students more and more as they move through college.	4.2558941552361285
3366. even	in such technical curricula as engineering the senior is much more	likely than the freshman to choose as an ideal liberal education over	specific vocational preparation.	4.96038068518468
3367. in the university milieu of scholarship	and research of social diversity of new ideas and varied and	wide-ranging interests socialization into a campus culture apparently	means heightened appreciation of the idea of a liberal education	in the arts and sciences.	4.031056800036264
3368. students' choices of ideal	educational goals are not arbitrary or whimsical.	6.289010577019261
3369. there is a clear	relationship between their educational evaluations and their basic	pattern of general values.	4.969770262711207
3370. the selective and directional qualities of	basic value-orientations are clearly evident in these data: the	success-oriented	students choose vocational preparation the other-directed	choose goals of social adjustment	the intellectuals choose a liberal arts emphasis.	4.570140842607308
3371. the same patterned consistency shows itself in occupational choices.	4.966876954792962
3372. there is impressive consistency between specific occupational	preferences and the student's basic conception of what is for him a	good way of life.	5.961121138541601
3373. and contrary to many popular assertions the goal-values	chosen do not seem to us to be primarily oriented to materialistic	success nor to mere conformity.	4.189344539113909
3374. our students want occupations	that permit them to use their talents and training to be creative	and original to work with and to help other people.	5.584718661503392
3375. they also want	money prestige and security.	6.836918879694162
3376. but they are optimistic about their	prospects in these regards; they set limits to their aspirations-	few aspire to millions of dollars or to imperial power and	glory.	5.939117833975948
3377. within the fixed frame of these aspirations they can afford	to place a high value on the expressive and people-oriented aspects of	occupation and to minimize the instrumental-reward values of power	prestige and wealth.	3.8818821920015356
3378. occupational choices are also useful-	and interesting- in bringing out clearly that values do not constitute	the only component in goals and aspirations.	5.103675880876918
3379. for there is also the	face of reality in the form of the individual's perceptions	of	his own abilities and interests of the objective possibilities open	to him of the familial and other social pressures to which he is exposed.	4.286558051779856
3380. we find reluctant recruits whose values are not in line with	their expected occupation's characteristics.	6.377312788299611
3381. students develop occupational	images- not always accurate or detailed- and they try to	fit their values to the presumed characteristics of the imagined occupation.	3.868849157236362
3382. the purely cognitive or informational problems are often acute.	5.804232386539297
3383. furthermore many reluctant recruits are yielding to social demands	or compromising in the face of their own limitations of opportunity	or of ability and performance.	4.548222403676112
3384. thus many a creativity-oriented aspirant	for a career in architecture drama or journalism resigns himself	to a real estate business; many a people-oriented student who dreams	of the md decides to enter his father's advertising agency;	and many a hopeful incipient business executive decides it were	better to teach the theory of business administration than to practice	it.	4.671394121830456
3385. the old ideal of the independent entrepreneur is extant- but	so is the recognition that the main chance may be in a corporate bureaucracy.	4.130583499244215
3386. in their views on dating courtship sex and family	life our students prefer what they are expected to prefer.	6.691879100807199
3387. for them	in the grim words of a once-popular song love and marriage go together	like a horse and carriage.	4.3660176071062775
3388. their expressed standards concerning	sex roles desirable age for marriage characteristics of an ideal mate	number of children desired are congruent with the values and stereotypes	of the preceding generation- minus compulsive rebellion.	4.909557333864093
3389. they	even accept the double standard of sex morality in a double sense	ie both sexes agree that standards for men differ from standards	for women and women apply to both sexes a standard different from	that held by men.	3.4641780251536765
3390. conservatism and traditionalism	seem implied by what has just been said.	6.289010577019261
3391. but these terms are treacherous.	7.723364728663726
3392. in the field of political values it is certainly true that	students are not radical not rebels against their parents or their peers.	6.21896363507041
3393. and as they go through college the students tend to bring their	political position in line with that prevalent in the social groups	to which they belong.	4.088568834076324
3394. yet they have accepted most of the extant welfare	state provisions for health security and the regulation of	economic affairs and they overwhelmingly approve of the traditional	liberalism of the bill of rights.	5.666286832301243
3395. when their faith in civil	liberties is tested against strong pressures of social expediency in specific	issues eg suppression of dangerous ideas many waver	and give in.	3.891717680490953
3396. the students who are most willing to acquiesce in the	suppression of civil liberties are also those who are most likely to	be prejudiced against minority groups to be conformist and traditionalistic	in general social attitudes and to lack a basic faith in people.	4.645735548018332
3397. as one looks at the existing evidence one finds a correlation	although only a slight one between high grades and libertarian	values.	4.221602047871791
3398. but the correlation is substantial only among upperclassmen.	7.817147942665264
3399. in other words as students go through college those who are	most successful academically tend to become more committed to a bill	of rights orientation.	4.1205120303033285
3400. college in gross- just the general experience-	may have varying effects but the the students who are successful	emerge with strengthened and clarified democratic values.	5.138376222747615
3401. this finding is consistent also with the fact that student leaders are	more likely to be supporters of the values implicit in civil liberties	than the other students.	4.309941998018257
3402. there is now substantial evidence	from several major studies of college students that the experience of	the college years results in a certain selective homogenization of	attitudes and values.	5.738828384258417
3403. detached from their prior statuses and social	groups and exposed to the pervasive stimuli of the university milieu	the students tend to assimilate a new common culture to converge	toward norms characteristic of their own particular campus.	3.8944588261328446
3404. furthermore	in certain respects there are norms common to colleges and universities	across the country.	5.933173114428453
3405. for instance college-educated people consistently	show up in study after study as more often than others supporters	of the bill of rights and other democratic rights and liberties.	3.987932800483113
3406. the interesting thing in this connection is that the norms upon which	students tend to converge include toleration of diversity.	5.568007574027143
3407. to the extent that our sampling of the orientations of american college	students in the years 1950 and 1952 may be representative of our	culture- and still valid in 1959- we are disposed to question the	summary characterization of the current generation as silent beat	apathetic or as a mass of other-directed conformists who are guided	solely by social radar without benefit of inner gyroscopes.	3.6179897780037975
3408. our data	indicate that these students of today do basically accept the existing	institutions of the society and in the face of the realities of complex	and large-scale economic and political problems make a wary and	ambivalent delegation of trust to those who occupy positions of legitimized	responsibility for coping with such collective concerns.	5.391757489288814
3409. in	a real sense they are admittedly conservative but their conservatism	incorporates a traditionalized embodiment of the original radicalism	of 1776.	4.524483683752041
3410. although we have no measures of its strength or intensity	the heritage of the doctrine of inalienable rights is retained.	6.8193597347562225
3411. as they move through the college years our young men and women are socialized	into a broadly similar culture at the level of personal	behavior.	4.532578084573329
3412. in this sense also they are surely conformists.	8.776081634276382
3413. it is	even true that some among them use the sheer fact of conformity- everyone	does it- as a criterion for conduct.	4.103879376007675
3414. but the extent of	ethical robotism is easily overestimated.	7.8167834745989735
3415. few students are really so	faceless in the not-so-lonely crowd of the swelling population in our	institutions of higher learning.	4.20808484142879
3416. and it may be well to recall that to	say	conformity is in part another way of saying orderly human	society.	6.865229110005379
3417. in the field of religious beliefs and values the	college students seem to faithfully reflect the surrounding culture.	4.897827869181466
3418. their commitments are for the most part couched in a familiar idiom.	7.493802445372158
3419. students testify to a felt need for a religious faith or ultimate	personal philosophy.	4.889391497463582
3420. avowed atheists or freethinkers are so rare as	to be a curiosity.	6.093123995732186
3421. the religious quest is often intense and deep	and there are students on every campus who are seriously wrestling with	the most profound questions of meaning and value.	3.4759891800631113
3422. at the same time	a major proportion of these young men and women see religion as a means	of personal adjustment an anchor for family life a source of emotional	security.	6.101532416500554
3423. these personal and social goals often overshadow the	goals of intellectual clarity and spiritual transcendence.	4.411633295274241
3424. the cult	of adjustment does exist.	6.916419102612548
3425. it exists alongside the acceptance of	traditional forms of organized religion	.	5.242557279060353
3426. still another segment of the student population consists	of those who seek in what they regard as religion intellectual clarity	rational belief and ethical guidance and reinforcement.	5.494108820524348
3427. our first impression of the data was that the students were surprisingly	orthodox and religiously involved.	4.625248596720302
3428. upon second thought we were	forced to realize that we have very few reliable historical benchmarks	against which we might compare the present situation and that conclusions	that present-day students are more or less religious	could not be defended on the basis of our data.	5.859743274567074
3429. as we looked more intently	at the content of our belief and the extent of religious participation	we received the impression that many of the religious convictions	expressed represented a conventional acceptance of low intensity.	4.770977457331977
3430. but here again comparative benchmarks are lacking and we do not	know in any case what measure of profoundity and intensity to expect	from healthy young secure and relatively inexperienced persons;	after all feelings of immortality and invulnerability are standard illusions	of youth.	4.847463006315385
3431. nor are optimistic and socially-oriented themes at	all rare in the distinctive religious history of this country.	4.658881251916754
3432. kluckhohn recently has summarized evidence regarding changes in values	during a period of years primarily 1935-1955 but extending much farther	back in some instances.	5.482717806588174
3433. a variety of data are assembled to bear	upon such alleged changes as diminished puritan morality work-success	ethic individualism achievement lessened emphasis on future-time	orientation in favor of sociability moral relativism consideration and	tolerance conformity hedonistic present-time orientation.	3.8483218368583154
3434. although	he questions the extent and nature of the alleged revival of religion	and the alleged increase in conformity and thinks that hedonistic	present-time orientation does not have the meaning usually attributed	to it he does conclude that americans increasingly enjoy leisure	without guilt do not stress achievement so much as formerly are more	accepting of group harmony as a goal more tolerant of diversity and	aware of other cultures.	4.8594915125585265
3435. from new jersey morgan hastened to the headquarters of washington	at whitemarsh pennsylvania arriving there on november 18th.	4.477431245060599
3436. there was much sickness in the corps and the men were in addition	without the clothing shoes and blankets needed for the winter weather.	6.126566671652827

3438. even on his tough constitution	the exposure and strenuous activity were beginning to tell in earnest.	6.258183461747524
3439. on the morning of november 17th cornwallis and 2000	men had left philadelphia with the object of capturing fort mercer	at red bank new jersey.	4.317945758357032
3440. in order to prevent this washington hastened	to dispatch several units to reinforce the fort including a force	under the marquis de lafayette containing some 160 of morgan's	riflemen all who were fit for duty at this time the rest having no shoes.	5.2799899782459185
3441. although the fort was evacuated in the face of the force of cornwallis	morgan and his men did have a chance to take another swing	at the redcoats.	5.062953019069259
3442. a picket guard of about 350 mostly hessians were	attacked by the americans under lafayette and driven back to their	camp some twenty to thirty of them falling before the riflemen's fire.	4.737638784068538
3443. i never saw men lafayette declared in regard to the	riflemen so merry so spirited and so desirous to go on to the	enemy whatever force they might have as that small party in this fight.	3.9843813487507123
3444. nathanael greene told washington that lafayette was charmed	with the spirited behavior of the militia and riflemen.	5.454336586728915
3445. a few days later it was learned that general howe was planning an	attack upon the american camp.	5.001085109080132
3446. the british general moved his forces	north from philadelphia to chestnut hill near the right wing of	the patriot encampment.	5.292868699667964
3447. here the pennsylvania militia skirmished with	the british but soon fled.	5.644380285667791
3448. morgan was ordered to attack the enemy	who had meantime moved to edge hill on the left of the americans.	6.0280478611699575
3449. similar orders were given to the maryland militia.	6.149717915003941
3450. morgan immediately	disposed his troops for action and found he had not long to wait.	5.890013371646935
3451. a body of redcoats were seen marching down a nearby slope a tempting	target for the riflemen who threw a volley into their ranks and messed	up the smart formation considerably.	3.7432644997638693
3452. now the riflemen and the	marylanders followed up their beginning and closed in on the british	giving them another telling round of fire.	6.027810140443071
3453. the redcoats ran like	rabbits.	5.528658944428094
3454. but the maryland militia had likewise fled all too typical	of this type of soldier during the revolution an experience which gave	morgan little confidence in militia in general as he watched other	instances of their breaking in hot engagements.	5.03097588916682
3455. the british although	suffering considerable losses noted the defection of the marylanders	made a stand then turned and attacked morgan who became greatly	outnumbered and had to retire.	3.8148659254558868
3456. the americans lost forty-four	men among them major joseph morris of morgan's regiment an	officer who was regarded with high esteem and affection not only by his	commander but by washington and lafayette as well.	4.5113339536080295
3457. the latter was	so upset on learning of the death of morris that he wrote morgan	a letter showing his own warmhearted generosity.	4.237503231935958
3458. after complimenting	morgan and the riflemen and saying he was praising them to congress	too the ardent frenchman added he felt that congress should make	some financial restitution to the widow and family of morris but that	he	knew morgan realized how long such action usually required if it was	done at all.	4.6405033004587795
3459. as mrs morris may be in some want before that	time lafayette continued i am going to trouble you with a commission	which i beg you will execute with the greatest secrecy.	3.9514991336733796
3460. if	she wanted to borrow any sum of money in expecting the arrangements of	congress it would not become a stranger unknown to her to offer himself	for that purpose.	5.194349316518827
3461. but you could tell her that	you had friends who being with the army don't know what to do with	their money and h would willingly let her have one or many thousand	dollars.	4.076402680832177
3462. this was accordingly done and the plight of the grateful	mrs morris was much relieved as a result of the generous loan	the amount of which is not known.	6.755261395766403
3463. apparently still sensitive	about the idea with which general gates had approached him at saratoga	namely that george washington be replaced morgan was vehement	in his support of the commander-in-chief during the campaign around	philadelphia.	3.881270798181214
3464. richard peters secretary of the board of war thought	morgan was so extreme on the subject that he accused him of trying	to pick a quarrel.	6.749097576108284
3465. morgan hotly denied this and informed the board	of war that the men in camp linked the name of peters with the plot	against washington.	4.200549223607738
3466. peters insisted that this impression was a great	misunderstanding and evidently from the quarrel obtained an unfavorable	impression of morgan's judgment.	5.22301107017409
3467. such a situation regarding	the board of war could hardly have helped morgan's chances for	promotion when that matter came before the group later on.	4.274716703079834
3468. in	late december the american army moved from whitemarsh to valley	forge and although the distance was only 13 miles the journey took	more than a week because of the bad weather the barefooted and almost	naked men.	5.047095514379757
3469. the position of the new camp was admirably selected and	well fortified its easily defensible nature being one good reason why	howe did not attack it.	4.134438021058999
3470. besides helping to prevent the movement of	the british to the west valley forge also obstructed the trade between	howe's forces and the farmers thus threatening the vital subsistence	of the redcoats and rendering their foraging to obtain necessary	supplies extremely hazardous.	5.121876068866737
3471. in order to see that this hindering	situation remained effective washington detached several bodies of his	troops to the periphery of the philadelphia area.	4.451412471688158
3472. morgan and	his corps were placed on the west side of the schuylkill river with	instructions to intercept all supplies found going to the city and	to keep a close eye on the movements of the enemy.	5.922049043495068
3473. the headquarters	of morgan was on a farm said to have been particularly well located	so as to prevent the farmers nearby from trading with the british a	practice all too common to those who preferred to sell their produce for	british gold rather than the virtually worthless continental currency.	3.9590256210418824
3474. in his dealings with offenders however morgan was typically	firm but just.	6.986134077190989
3475. for example he captured some persons from york county	who with teams were taking to philadelphia the furniture of a man	who had just been released from prison through the efforts of his wife	and who apparently was helpless to prevent the theft of his household	goods.	3.8453009895047057
3476. morgan took charge of the furniture and restored it to its	thankful owners but he let the culprits who had stolen it go free.	5.328035400428666
3477. morgan complained to washington about the men detailed to him	for scouting duty most of them he said being useless.	4.435453045541116
3478. they straggle	at such a rate he told the commander-in-chief that if the	enemy were enterprising they might get two from us when we would take	one of them which makes me wish general howe would go on lest any	incident happen to us.	4.814696601231299
3479. if the hardships of the winter at	valley forge were trying for healthy men they were of course much	more so for those not in good health.	4.162340553190477
3480. daniel morgan's rheumatic condition	worsened with the increase of the cold and damp weather.	6.414471748739771
3481. he	had braved the elements and the enemy but the strain aided by the winter	was catching up with him at last.	3.9440350216957922
3482. also he was now forty-three	years old.	9.090792964814367
3483. the mild activity of his command during the sojourn of the	troops at valley forge could be handled by a subordinate he felt	so like henry knox equally loyal to washington who went to boston	at this time morgan received permission to visit his home in virginia	for several weeks.	3.3225323536712765
3484. in his absence the rifle regiment was under	the command of major thomas posey another able virginian.	6.043515076170518
3485. but morgan did not leave before he had written a letter to a william	pickman in salem massachusetts apparently an acquaintance praising	washington and saying that the slanders propagated about him were	opposed by the general current of the people h to exalt general	gates at the expense of general washington was injurious to the latter.	3.822782880794264
3486. if there be a disinterested patriot in america 'tis general	washington and his bravery none can question.	6.267987899338843
3487. it is doubtful	if morgan was able to take home much money to his wife and children	for his pay as shown by the war department abstracts of early	1778 was $75 a month as a colonel and that apt to be delayed.	4.143527113241339
3488. he	was shown a warm welcome regardless and spent the time in winchester	recuperating from his ailment enjoying his family and arranging his	private affairs which were of course run down.	5.3378431769021395
3489. his neighbors celebrated	his return even if it was only temporary and morgan was especially	gratified by the quaint expression of an elderly friend isaac	lane who told him a man that has so often left all that is dear	to him as thou hast to serve thy country must create a sympathetic	feeling in every patriotic heart.	3.6814823765353957
3490. there must have been special	feelings of joy and patriotism in the heart of daniel morgan too	when the news was received on april 30th of the recognition by france	of the independence of the united states.	6.223585021099589
3491. his fellow virginian	george washington had stated i believe no event was ever received	with more heartfelt joy.	4.1649418300281935
3492. the dreary camp at valley forge	was turned into an arena of rejoicing.	5.390500575037483
3493. even the dignified washington	indulged in a game of wickets with some children.	5.206805667769545
3494. his soldiers on the	whole did not celebrate so mildly.	6.785689629671467
3495. on may 6th morgan who had returned	received from washington orders to send out patrols under	vigilant officers to keep near the enemy.	4.20447417598261
3496. the reason for this	the orders said is that the enemy may think to take advantage of	the celebration of this day.	6.478183143946886
3497. the troops must have more than the common	quantity of liquor and perhaps there will be some little drunkenness	among them.	4.722074588182047
3498. apparently no serious disorders resulted from	the celebration and within a few days morgan joined the force of	lafayette who now had command of some 2000 men at barren hill not	far above philadelphia on the schuylkill.	5.202485593327476
3499. the frenchman had been	ordered to approach the enemy's lines harass them and get intelligence	of their movements.	3.831591583717134
3500. interestingly enough the order transmitted	to morgan through alexander hamilton also informed him that a party	of indians will join the party to be sent from your command at whitemarsh	and act with them.	4.93782734520984
3501. washington evidently was anxious for morgan to be cautious as well	as aggressive for on may 17th 18th and 20th he admonished the leader	of the riflemen-rangers to be on the alert.	3.7464736693840406
3502. obviously the commander-in-chief	had confidence that morgan would furnish him good intelligence	too for on the 23rd of may he told morgan that the british were	prepared to move perhaps in the night and asked morgan to have two	of his best horses ready to dispatch to general smallwood with the	intelligence obtained.	4.742694206795073
3503. meantime however this same general smallwood	seemed to be serving chivalry as well as the american army.	5.212422811334894
3504. colonel	benjamin ford wrote to morgan from wilmington that he understood	a mrs sanderson from maryland had obtained permission from smallwood	to visit philadelphia and would return on may 26th escorted	by several officers from maryland belonging to the new levies	in the british service.	4.713688850171402
3505. ford urged morgan to capture these men	who he thought might be disguised as quakers or peasants.	4.060235568763422
3506. morgan took	the suggested steps but when mrs sanderson appeared there was	nobody with her but her husband whom he promptly sent to headquarters	to be questioned.	4.96038068518468
3507. but morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence	much more important to his commanding general.	4.857330776764967
3508. a letter of a	few days later from washington's aide to morgan stated his excellency	is highly pleased with your conduct upon this occasion.	5.107323874647867
3509. for by now the original cause of the quarrel philip's seizure of	gascony was only one strand in the spider web of french interests that	overlay all western europe and that had been so well and closely	spun that the lightest movement could set it trembling from one end to	the other.	3.8763053989491163
3510. even so edward's ambassadors can scarcely have foreseen	that five years of unremitting work lay ahead of them before peace	was finally made and that when it did come the countless embassies that	left england for rome during that period had very little to do with	it.	5.012715554575958
3511. it is hard not to lay most of the blame for their failures	on the pope.	5.780968210053671
3512. nogaret is hardly an impartial witness and even he	did	not make his charges against boniface until the latter was dead but	there is some truth in what he said and more in what he did not say.	5.454211023437759
3513. it was not merely a hunger for money gold and precious objects	that delayed the papal pronouncement that could have brought the war	to an end; the pope was playing a dangerous game with so many balls	in the air at once that a misstep would bring them all about his ears	and his only hope was to temporize so that he could take advantage	of every change in the delicate balance of european affairs.	3.675194564148225
3514. when the	negotiations began his quarrel with the king of france was temporarily	in abeyance and he had no intention of reviving it so long as there	was hope that french money would come to pay the troops who under	charles of valois	the papal vicar of tuscany were so valuable in	the crusade against the colonna cardinals and their sicilian allies.	5.227909099868875
3515. if his circumspection in regard to philip's sensibilities went so	far that he even refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage of	amadee's daughter agnes to the son of the dauphin of vienne-	a truly peacemaking move according to thirteenth-century ideas for savoy	and dauphine were as usual fighting on opposite sides- for fear	that he might seem to be favoring the anti-french coalition he would	certainly never take the far more drastic step of ordering the return	of gascony to edward even though as he admitted to the english	ambassadors he had been advised that the original cession was invalid.	3.5066800175289563
3516. on the other hand he did not want to offend edward either and	he found himself in a very difficult position.	7.554827845101702
3517. on the surface the whole	question was purely feudal.	6.228988187350773
3518. the french were now occupying gascony	and flanders on the technical grounds that their rulers had forfeited	them by a breach of the feudal contract.	4.758826382133934
3519. but edward was invading	scotland for precisely the same reason and his insubordinate vassal	was the ally of the king of france.	4.418189537079665
3520. boniface had to uphold the sacredness	of the feudal contract at all costs for it was only as suzerain	of sicily and of the patrimony of peter that he had any justification	for his italian wars but in the english-scottish-french triangle	it was almost impossible for him to recognize the claims of any one	of the contestants without seeming to invalidate those of the other	two.	5.3569861774819145
3521. because of these involvements in the matter at stake boniface	lacked the impartiality that is supposed to be an essential qualification	for the position of arbiter and in retrospect that would	seem to be	sufficient reason why the english embassies to the curia proved	so fruitless.	4.327044955222651
3522. but when the situation was so complicated that even	nogaret one of the principal actors in the drama could misinterpret	the pope's motives it is possible that othon and his companions	equally baffled attributed their difficulties to a more immediate cause.	5.885351205449488
3523. this was boniface's monumental tactlessness.	7.654207701395827
3524. tact by	its very derivation implies that its possessor keeps in touch with other	people but the author of clericis laicos and unam sanctam	the wielder of the two swords the papal sun of which the imperial	moon was but a dim reflection the peer of caesar and vice-regent	of christ was so high above other human beings that he had forgotten	what they were like.	4.931091696385765
3525. he was a learned and brilliant man one of the	best jurists in europe and with flashes of penetrating insight and yet	in his dealings with other people particularly when he tried to be	ingratiating he was capable of an abysmal stupidity that can have come	only from a complete incomprehension of human nature and human motives.	3.674370769747284
3526. this lofty disregard for others was not shared by such men	as pierre flotte and his associates that brilliant group of mediocre	men as powicke calls them who provided the brains for the	french embassy that came to rome under the nominal leadership of the	archbishop of narbonne the duke of burgundy and the count of st-pol.	4.4633298069672085
3527. they had risen from humble beginnings by their own diligence	and astuteness they were unfettered by the codes that bound nobles	like othon or even the older generation of clerks like hotham and	they were working for an end that their opponents had never even visualized.	3.6775133724106066
3528. boniface was later to explain to the english that robert	of burgundy and guy de st-pol were easy enough to do business with;	it was the clerks who caused the mischief and who made him say	that the ruling passion of their race was covetousness and that in dealing	with them he never knew whether he had to do with a frenchman or	with a devil.	4.828121016518542
3529. to the pope head of the universal church to the duke	of burgundy taking full advantage of his position on the borders	of france and of the empire or to othon who found it quite natural	that he should do homage to edward for tipperary and to the count	of savoy for grandson flotte's outspoken nationalism was completely	incomprehensible.	3.92192572772531
3530. and yet he made no pretense about it; when	the pope trying no doubt to appeal to his better nature said to him	you have already taken normandy.	5.473676001700407
3531. do you want to drive the king	of england from all his overseas possessions?	5.523024638272517
3532.  the frenchman's	answer was a terse vous dites vrai.	5.998227019452429
3533. loyal and unscrupulous	with a single-minded ambition to which he devoted all his energies he	outmatched the english diplomats time and time again until by a kind	of poetic justice he fell at the battle of courtrai the victim of	the equally nationalistic if less articulate flemings.	3.5753478853442218
3534. the	english relying on a prejudiced arbiter and confronted with superior	diplomatic skill were also hampered in their negotiations by the events	that were taking place at home.	5.000159944036978
3535. the scots had found a new leader	in william wallace and edward's yearly expeditions across the border	called for evermounting taxes which only increased his difficulties	with the barons and the clergy.	3.4535739936548104
3536. he was unable to send any more	help to his allies on the continent and during the next few years many	of them left to resist french pressure unaided surrendered to the	inevitable and made their peace with philip.	5.38516700077188
3537. the defeat and death	of adolf	of nassau at the hands of albert of habsburg also worked to	the disadvantage of the english for all the efforts to revive the	anti-french coalition came to nothing when philip made an alliance with	the new king of the romans.	3.7288904452516003
3538. these shifts in alliance and	allegiance not only increased the difficulties confronting the english	embassy as a whole but also directly involved the two savoyards amadee	and othon.	5.279457656263276
3539. in spite of the armistice negotiated by amadee two	years earlier the war between bishop guillaume of lausanne and louis	of savoy was still going on and although little is known about	it that little proves that it was yet another phase of the struggle	against french expansion and was closely interwoven with the larger conflict.	3.7167458393058577
3540. a second truce had been arbitrated in april 1298 by jean	d'arlay lord of chalon-sur-saone the most staunch of	edward's	burgundian allies and these last were represented in the discussions	at the curia by gautier de montfaucon othon's neighbor and a	member of the vaudois coalition.	4.732144333063761
3541. but although in many of these	discussions othon and amadee might have been tempted to consider	their own interests as well as those of the king edward's confidence	in them was so absolute that they were made the acknowledged leaders	of the embassy.	4.691788974203002
3542. amadee may have owed this partly to his relationship	with the king but othon who at sixty seems still to have been a simple	knight merited his position solely by his own character and ability.	5.378548401974897
3543. the younger men vere and pembroke who was also edward's	cousin and whose lusignan blood gave him the swarthy complexion that	caused edward of carnarvon's irreverent friend piers gaveston	to nickname him joseph the jew were relatively new to the game	of diplomacy but pontissara had been on missions to rome before	and hotham a man of great learning jocund in speech agreeable	to meet of honest religion and pleasing in the eyes of all and an	archbishop to boot was as reliable and experienced as othon himself.	3.421594401286985
3544. but all the reports of this first embassy show that the two savoyards	were the heads of it for they were the only ones who were empowered	to swear for the king that he would abide by the pope's decision	and who were allowed to appoint deputies in the event that one was unavoidably	absent.	5.421046219918542
3545. this also gave them the unpleasant duty of	being spokesmen for the mission and they could foresee that that would	not be easy.	3.9664409965648346
3546. underneath all the high-sounding phrases of royal and	papal letters and behind the more down-to-earth instructions to the envoys	was the inescapable fact that edward would have to desert his flemish	allies and leave them to the vengeance of their indignant suzerain	the king of france in return for being given an equally free hand	with the insubordinate scots.	4.798431869205482
3547. this was a doubly bitter blow to the	king.	6.635080782388943
3548. in the eyes of those who still cared for such things it was	a reflection on his honor and it gave further grounds for complaint to	his overtaxed subjects who were already grumbling- although probably	not in latin- non est lex sana quod regi sit mea lana.	4.993881732098125
3549. bad relations between england and flanders brought hard times to the	shepherds scattered over the dales and downs as well as to the crowded	flemish cities and while the english so far had done no more than	grumble othon had seen what the discontent might lead to for before	he left the low countries the citizens of ghent had risen in protest	against the expense of supporting edward and his troops and the	regular soldiers had found it unexpectedly difficult to put down the	nasty little riot that ensued.	3.5301078951389067
3550. in all the talk of feudal rights	the knights and bishops must never forget the woolworkers nor was	it easy to do so for all along the road to italy they passed the florentine	pack trains going home with their loads of raw wool from england	and rough flemish cloth the former to be spun and woven by the	arte della lana and the latter to be refined and dyed by the arte	della calimala with the pigment recently discovered in asia minor	by one of their members bernardo rucellai the secret of which they	jealously kept for themselves.	4.698586347287241
3551. these chatty merchants made amusing and	instructive traveling companions for their business took them to all	four corners of the globe and florentine gossip had already reached	a high stage of development as even a cursory glance at the inferno	will prove.	3.700673150164485
3552. a northern ambassador willing to keep his mouth shut	and his ears open could learn a lot that would stand him in good stead	at the curia.	4.960405991228926
3553. they had other topics of conversation besides	their news from courts and fairs which were of interest to othon	the builder of castles in wales and churches in his native country.	3.998403750157124
3554. behind him lay the low countries where men were still completing	the cathedrals that a later florentine would describe as a malediction	of little tabernacles one on top of the other with so many pyramids	and spires and leaves that it is a wonder they stand up at all	for they look as though they were made of paper instead of stone or marble;	the low countries where the middle ages were to last for	another two centuries and die out only when charles the bold of burgundy	met his first defeat in the fields and forests below the walls	of grandson.	4.768465132219572
3555. it usually turned out well for him because either he liked the right	people or there were only a few wrong people in the town.	4.8003823293752435
3556. alfred wanted	to invest in my father's hotel and advance enough money to build	a larger place.	5.910942355000923
3557. it was a very tempting offer.	7.752596039464232
3558. my father would have done	it if it hadn't been for my mother who had a fear of being in debt	to anyone- even alfred alpert.	5.553021863043476
3559. in spite of his being well	liked there were a few people who were very careful about alfred.	5.19266263052514
3560. they had my mother's	opinion of him: that he was too sharp or a little	too good to be true.	6.6768073566645745
3561. one of the people who was afraid of alfred	was his own brother lew.	6.155631736843368
3562. i don't know how and i don't know why	but the two stores the one in margaretville and the one in fleischmanns	that had been set up as a partnership were dissolved separated	from each other.	5.2261114323689775
3563. everything was all very friendly except when it came	to harry the youngest brother.	4.772696211251608
3564. alfred who was a good deal older	than harry had treated him like a son and when harry decided to stay	in business with lew instead of going with alfred alfred looked	on the decision as a betrayal.	5.25965611769121
3565. from that day on he never spoke to harry	or to lew or to lew's two boys mort and jimmy.	4.492427569700508
3566. the six	miles between the towns became an ocean and the alperts became a family	of strangers.	5.124518734431128
3567. time went on and everybody got older.	6.29219846215233
3568. i became	fifteen sixteen then twenty and still tessie alpert sat on the	porch with a rose in her hair and alfred got richer and sicker with	diabetes.	5.1016378613221915
3569. it was in the spring of the year when he took to his bed and	tessie and alfred found out that they didn't know each other.	5.1008723375351686
3570. they	were like two strangers.	9.732176019281018
3571. the store was their marriage and when	alfred had to leave it there was nothing to hold them together.	4.132189454443298
3572. tessie	everybody thought was a strong woman but she was only strong because	she had alfred to lean on.	5.486019882908944
3573. and when alfred was forced into his	bed tessie left the front porch of the store and sat at home rocking	in her rocker in the living room staring out the window- the rose	still in her hair.	3.86767315804587
3574. tessie could do nothing for alfred.	7.603896187885215
3575. she couldn't	cook or clean or make him comfortable.	5.577160538876469
3576. instead she waited for alfred	to get better and take care of her.	7.386730209587359
3577. spring was life- and	alfred alpert in his sickroom was death.	4.741182732535847
3578. i remember him pointing out of the window and saying that he wished he	could live to see another spring but that he wouldn't.	6.044748883920035
3579. alfred	began to put his affairs in order and he went about it like a man	putting his things into storage.	3.9562712649108605
3580. my father who liked alfred very much	was a constant visitor.	7.099684335976853
3581. one day alfred told him that he had decided	to leave everything to me.	5.9702183449217445
3582. my father a wise man asked him not	to.	7.840990564124358
3583. he knew alfred liked me; if he wanted to leave me something let	it be a trinket nothing else.	4.590901974621745
3584. by leaving me everything he wouldn't	be doing me a favor my father told him and he didn't want to see	his daughter involved in a lawsuit.	5.51707820599167
3585. he didn't want alfred to leave	me trouble because that's all it would be and alfred understood.	4.689769288360704
3586. alfred was getting too sick to stay in his own home.	7.410731507907687
3587. the doctor	wanted him in a hospital; the nearest one was forty miles away	in kingston.	4.122090696292193
3588. the day alfred left his home and fleischmanns he gave	up the convictions of a lifetime.	5.743409781516148
3589. he sent me for meltzer the butcher	whom he wanted not as a friend but as a rabbi.	4.684738898703522
3590. meltzer knew	why i had come for him.	7.1581511048922275
3591. solemnly he walked me back to alfred's	house without a word passing between us.	4.305414028832856
3592. he entered the house in silence	walked into alfred's room and closed the door behind him.	6.595259524015936
3593. i	sat down to wait and i watched tessie alpert who hadn't moved	or said a word but kept staring out of the window.	4.168493231080278
3594. for a few minutes	there was nothing to hear.	9.616002687168644
3595. then meltzer's voice quiet calm	strong started the kaddish the prayer for the dead.	4.653672130069625
3596. i could hear	alfred's voice a few words behind meltzer's like a counterpoint	punctuated by sobs of sorrow and resignation.	5.795036674566641
3597. there was a finality	in the rhythm of the prayer- it was the end of a life the end of hope	and the wondering if there would ever be another beginning.	5.4820922338939955
3598. meltzer stayed with alfred and when the door opened they both came	out.	6.611859812103652
3599. alfred was dressed for his trip to the hospital.	5.793437477681424
3600. the car was	waiting for him.	7.310829408500566
3601. alfred leaning on meltzer stopped for a minute to	look at tessie.	4.734238785241743
3602. she didn't turn away from the window.	10.013688953886387
3603. alfred nodded	a little nod and went out through the door.	5.099747979546716
3604. outside his brother	harry was waiting for him- he had come to say good-bye.	6.8583908855083555
3605. alfred	walked past him without a word and got into the car.	4.79787368965218
3606. harry ran to	the side of the car where alfred was sitting and looked at him begging	him to speak.	6.2273115094940765
3607. the car began to move	and harry ran after it crying alfred! alfred! speak to me.	3.916257424215012
3608. but the car moved off and alfred just looked straight ahead.	6.806060629982271
3609. harry	followed the car until it reached the main road and turned towards	kingston.	4.411891185517149
3610. he stood there watching until it had gone from his sight.	6.73770819684757
3611. i went to visit alfred in the kingston hospital a few times.	5.042438400815609
3612. the first time i went there he asked me to bring him water from	flagler's well- water that reminded him of his first days in the	mountains- and before i came the next time i filled a five-gallon	jug for him and brought it to the hospital.	5.336354693691462
3613. i don't think he ever	got to drink any of it.	5.157739761024007
3614. the jug stayed at the hospital and the	water- what can happen to water?	5.879132938872651
3615. - it evaporated disappeared and	came back to the earth as rain- maybe for another well or another	stream or another alfred alpert.	4.2573214836288855
3616. mr banks was always called banks the butcher until he left	town and the shop passed over to meltzer the scholar who then became	automatically meltzer the butcher.	5.051723613743259
3617. meltzer was a boarder with the	banks family.	5.3285636594893
3618. he came to fleischmanns directly from the boat that	brought him to america from russia.	6.146224108467706
3619. he was a learned man and a very	gentle soul.	6.908443942096795
3620. he was filled with knowledge of the bible and the talmud.	9.726179444988219
3621. he knew the whyfores and the wherefores but he was weak very weak	on the therefores.	5.288517573895839
3622. banks the butcher took meltzer the scholar	as an apprentice and he made it very clear that a man of learning must	be able to do more than just quote the commentaries of the talmud in	order to live.	5.4462957980185065
3623. so meltzer learned a new trade from banks who supplied	the town and the hotels with meat.	4.3703990134474155
3624. banks had a family-	a wife a daughter and a son.	6.289010577019261
3625. the daughter lilly was a very good	friend of mine and i always had hopes that someday she and meltzer would	find each other.	3.661382077623062
3626. they lived in the same house and it didn't seem	to be such a hard	thing to do but the sad realities of lilly's life	and the fact that meltzer didn't love her never satisfied my wishful	thinking.	5.705823259161098
3627. banks the butcher was a hard master and a hard	father a man who didn't seem to know the difference between the living	flesh of his family and the hanging carcasses of his stock in trade.	4.435550361900575
3628. he treated both with equal indifference and with equal contempt;	perhaps he was a little more sympathetic to the sides of beef that	hung silently from his hooks.	5.930324471239028
3629. lilly banks and i became friends.	5.66037853959279
3630. she was the opposite of everything she should have been- a positive	pole in a negative home a living reaction of warmth and kindness	to the harsh reality of her father.	5.188757612448207
3631. and lilly's whole family seemed	to be an apology for mr banks.	4.78898974377291
3632. her brother karl was a very gentle	soul her mother was a quiet woman who said little but who had hard	probing eyes.	5.7123959912654865
3633. for every rude word of mr banks's the family	had five in apology.	4.950231088111868
3634. every chance i got i left the hotel to	visit lilly.	6.9393901896712995
3635. i was free but she was bound to her duties that not even	the coming of meltzer lightened.	4.675243262744602
3636. she had to clean the glass on the	display cases in the butcher shop help her brother scrub the cutting	tables with wire brushes mop the floors put down new sawdust on the	floors and help check the outgoing orders.	4.937252522253419
3637. when these chores were	finished only then was she allowed whatever freedom she could find.	4.762234558216824
3638. i helped lilly in the store.	8.447093604449028
3639. to me it was a game to her it	was the deadly seriousness of life.	5.417888500319147
3640. i wanted to help so that we could	find time to play.	7.161586035262922
3641. and lilly allowed me to help so that she could	have her few little hours of escape.	4.229092429049538
3642. when the work was finished	we would walk.	9.394696756818522
3643. the road past the butcher shop took us along the side	of a stream.	4.165513023927246
3644. it ran north away from the town and the people through	woods and past the nothingness of a graveyard.	7.048326059757257
3645. lilly preferred	the loneliness of that walk.	5.66037853959279
3646. i would have liked the town and the	busyness of its people but i always followed lilly into the peace of	the silent and unstaring road.	5.986186635237319
3647. it wasn't hard to understand.	7.268150653382921
3648. to me lilly was a fine and lovely girl.	7.4103499115562
3649. to people who didn't know	her she was a gawky badly dressed kid whose arms were too long whose	legs were a little too bony.	4.309039940582286
3650. she had the hips of a boy and a loose-jointed	walk that reminded me of a string of beads strolling down the	street.	5.829004896643788
3651. and she had the kind of crossed eyes that shocked.	6.76988657793209
3652. it was	unexpected unexpected because lilly walked with her head bent down	down and her mark of friendship was to look into your face.	5.556523053706493
3653. i accepted	her crossed eyes as she accepted my childishness; childishness compared	to her grown-up understanding that life was a punishment for as	yet undisclosed sins.	3.8730833657327617
3654. we were almost the same age she was fifteen	i was twelve and where i felt there was a life to look forward to lilly	felt she had had as much of it as was necessary.	6.146319851222365
3655. when we	went for our walks lilly's brother would come along every once in	a while.	4.5725098308248135
3656. karl was an almost exact copy of his father physically and it	was strange to see the expected become the unexpected.	5.905489304344681
3657. this huge hulk	played the guitar and he would take it along on our walks and play	for us as we sat alone in the woods or by the stream.	3.7977260440063416
3658. karl played well	and his favorite song was a schubert lullaby.	6.289010577019261
3659. he spoke no german	but he could sing it and the words of the song were the only ones he knew	in a foreign language.	4.581397378755227
3660. the song he said was called the stream's	lullaby and when he sang gute ruh gute ruh mach't	die augen zu there was such longing and such simple sadness that	it frightened me.	4.855404917157742
3661. later when i was older i found the song was part	of schubert's die scho^ne mu^llerin.	5.129704416239473
3662. and even hearing	it in a concert hall surrounded by hundreds of people the words and	the melody would make me a little colder and i would reach out for my	husband's hand.	5.223727446547828
3663. the brother and sister seemed to be a sort	of mutual-aid society a little fortress of kindness for each other in	a hard world.	4.214220108967323
3664. i felt very flattered to be included in the protection	of their company even though i had nothing to be protected from.	6.18232793556677
3665. the turn of the century or to be more precise the two decades	preceeding and following it marks a great change in the history of	early english scholarship.	4.42671090716454
3666. at the bottom of this change were great strides	forward in the technical equipment and technical standards of the	historian.	6.46053965591596
3667. in archaeology for example the contributions of frederick	haverfield and reginald smith to the various volumes of the victoria	county histories raised the discipline from the status of an	antiquarian pastime to that of the most valuable single tool of the	early english historian.	4.251698531658399
3668. and with the publication of e t leeds'	archaeology of the anglo-saxon settlements the student	was presented with an organized synthesis of the archaeological data	then known.	5.654299944493042
3669. what was true for archaeology was also true of place-name	studies.	5.642052527955999
3670. the value of place-names in the reconstruction of early	english history had long been recognized.	6.1296115845517045
3671. place-names in fact	had been extensively utilized for this purpose from the time of camden	onwards.	4.773570156009608
3672. without a precise knowledge of germanic philology however	it is debatable whether their use was not more often a source of confusion	and error than anything else.	5.477694786250206
3673. even in the nineteenth century	such accomplished philologists as kemble and guest were led into what	now seem ludicrous errors because of their failure to recognize that	modern forms of place names are not necessarily the result of logical	philological development.	4.397825181260118
3674. it was therefore not until the publication	of jh round's the settlement of the south and east	saxons and wh stevenson's dr guest and the english	conquest of south britain that a scientific basis for place-name	studies was established.	5.393210963923647
3675. diplomatic is another area for	which the dawn of the twentieth century marks the beginning of modern	standards of scholarship.	4.745387260230057
3676. although because of the important achievements	of nineteenth century scholars in the field of textual criticism	the advance is not so striking as it was in the case of archaeology	and place-names the editorial principles laid down by stevenson in	his great edition of asser and in his crawford charters were a	distinct improvement upon those of his predecessors and remain unimproved	upon today.	5.897604924906597
3677. in sum it can be said that the techniques and	standards of present day have their origin at the turn of the century.	5.655492766671482
3678. and it is this particularly the establishment of archaeology and	place-name studies on a scientific basis which are immediately pertinent	to the saxon shore.	6.888693464505924
3679. almost inevitably the first result	of this technological revolution was a reaction against the methods and	in many cases the conclusions of the oxford school of stubbs freeman	and green regarding the nature of the anglo-saxon	conquest of britain.	3.9571148024899654
3680. even before the century was out the tide of	reaction had set in.	6.859129687292717
3681. charles plummer in the introduction and notes to	his splendid edition of bede voiced some early doubts concerning the	elaborate superstructure they raised up over the slim foundations	afforded by the traditional narratives of the conquest.	3.592796964105791
3682. it was plummer	in fact who coined the much quoted remark: mr green	indeed writes as if he had been present at the landing of the saxons	and had watched every step of their subsequent progress.	5.6627111251022
3683. sir henry	howorth writing in 1898 put himself firmly in the lappenburg-kemble	tradition by attacking the veracity of the west saxon annals.	4.510977442861384
3684. early in the present century w h stevenson continued	the attack with a savage article against guest.	6.897311530159715
3685. following him in varying	degrees of scepticism were tw shore hm chadwick	thomas hodgkin and f g beck.	4.354581878378772
3686. by 1913 ferdinand lot	could begin an article subtitled la conquete de la grande-bretagne	par les saxons with the words il est difficile aujourd	'hui d'entretenir des illusions sur la valeur du recit traditionnel	de la conquete de la grande-bretagne h.	4.809162730017353
3687. it is also worthy	of note that lot cited both kemble and lappenberg with favor in	that article.	4.646864723431038
3688. it would seem that the wheel had turned full circle.	8.255642930312332
3689. in fact modern scholarly opinion in the main has not retreated	all the way back to the destructive scepticism of the first half of the	nineteenth century.	5.006772410262463
3690. although one meets with occasional extremists like	zachrisson or very recently arthur wade-evans the majority of	scholars have taken a middle position between the extremes of scepticism	and gullibility.	5.3499881591367
3691. most now admit that bede gildas nennius and	the anglo-saxon chronicles cannot be the infallible guides to early	english history that guest freeman and green thought them to be.	3.8713478202439124
3692. as rh hodgkin has remarked: the critical methods of	the nineteenth century shattered most of this picturesque narrative.	5.8768009336449625
3693. on	the other hand the consensus of opinion is that used with caution	and in conjunction with other types of evidence the native sources still	provide a valid rough outline for the english settlement of southern	britain.	4.023176604828358
3694. as sir charles oman once said it is no longer fashionable	to declare that we can say nothing certain about old english	origins.	6.765758248189125
3695. therefore in one way kemble and lappenberg	have been vindicated.	5.741027248562998
3696. their conclusions concerning the untrustworthiness	of the west saxon annals the confused chronology of bede the	unreliability of the early positions of the anglo-saxon genealogies	and the mythological elements contained in nennius are now mostly accepted.	5.038284077310446
3697. nevertheless in another way modern historians still labor in	the vineyard of the oxford school.	4.586116821838751
3698. for it is their catastrophic concept	of the anglo-saxon invasions rather than kemble's gradualist	approach which dominates the field.	6.722928853390084
3699. despite the rejection of the traditional	accounts on many points of detail as late as 1948 it was still	possible to postulate a massive and comparatively sudden	influx of germans as the type of invasions.	4.061033083888245
3700. at	this point of course the issue has become complicated by a development	unforeseen by lappenberg and kemble.	5.966617726469975
3701. they however much they were	in disagreement with the late victorians over the method by which	britain was germanized agreed with them that the end result was the	complete extinction of the previous celtic population and civilization.	3.648461782576242
3702. but beginning for all practical purposes with frederick seebohm's	english village community scholars have had to reckon	with a theory involving institutional and agrarian continuity between	roman and anglo-saxon times which is completely at odds with the reigning	concept of the anglo-saxon invasions.	4.991309851771062
3703. against seebohm formidable	foes have taken the field notably f w maitland whose	domesday book and beyond was written expressly for this purpose	and sir paul vinogradoff whose the growth of the manor had	a similar aim.	3.933456070891631
3704. largely due to their efforts the catastrophic invasion-theory	has maintained its position although seebohm has always found	supporters.	5.454336586728915
3705. hl gray in his english field systems and	zachrisson's romans kelts and saxons defended in part the	seebohm thesis while at the present time hpr finberg and	gordon copley seem to fall into the celtic survivalist camp.	3.8679842306182626
3706. this	is nevertheless a minority view.	9.926945921249153
3707. most scholars while willing to accept	a survival of celtic art forms and a considerable proportion	of the celtic population reject any institutional legacy from	pre-anglo-saxon britain.	3.912318952129464
3708. therefore it is plain that the	clear distinctions of the nineteenth century are no longer with us.	7.09412692000062
3709. in the main stream of historical thinking is a group of scholars hm	chadwick rh hodgkin sir frank stenton et al	who are in varying degrees sceptical of the native traditions of the conquest	but who defend the catastrophic type of invasion suggested by	them.	3.8317497744116324
3710. they in effect have compromised the opposing positions of the	nineteenth century.	6.4370827295769395
3711. on the other side are the celtic survivalists who	have taken a tack divergent from both these schools of nineteenth century	thought.	4.65762074864686
3712. as a group they should be favorable to a concept of gradual	germanic infiltration although the specialist nature of much of	their work eg seebohm gray and finberg tends to obscure	their sympathies.	5.697584351120707
3713. those who do have occasion to deal with the invasions	in a more general way like tw shore and arthur wade-evans	are on the side of a gradual and often peaceful germanic penetration	into britain.	4.50504886328511
3714. wade-evans in fact denies that there were any anglo-saxon	invasions at all other than a minor jutish foray in ad	514.	5.4738267710351725
3715. now omitting for a moment some recent developments	we can say the saxon shore hypothesis of lappenberg and kemble has	undergone virtual eclipse in this century.	4.099872269975866
3716. it is no longer possible	to say that a sceptical attitude towards the received accounts of the	invasions almost automatically produces a shore occupied by interpretation.	5.781910320998562
3717. everyone is more or less sceptical and virtually no one has	been willing to accept lappenberg or kemble's position on that	point.	4.319924020728383
3718. one reason is of course that the new scepticism has been willing	to maintain the general picture of the invasions as portrayed in	the traditional sources.	6.826464812356217
3719. the few scholars who have adopted the shore	occupied by interpretation howorth shore and wade-evans	have all been celtic survivalists.	3.753506231366399
3720. moreover they have done so in rather	special circumstances.	8.47166250640164
3721. the primary reason for the abandonment	of the shore occupied by thesis has been the assimilation and	accumulation of archaeological evidence the most striking feature	of early english studies in this century.	3.800267477029604
3722. again omitting recent developments	et	leeds' dictum of 1913 has stood unchallenged: so far	as archaeology is concerned there is not the least warrant for the	second of these theories.	6.120548778816774
3723. even earlier haverfield	had come to the same conclusion.	7.81346290912735
3724. what they meant was that there	was no evidence to show that the south and east coasts of britain received	germanic settlers conspicuously earlier than some other parts of	england.	6.127118796645901
3725. that is there was no trace of anglo-saxons in britain	as early as the late third century to which time the archaeological	evidence for the erection of the saxon shore forts was beginning to	point.	4.038510948977839
3726. in the face of a clear judgment from archaeology therefore it	became impossible for a time for scholars to re-adopt the shore settled	by theory.	6.11633808891851
3727. in recent years however a wind of change	seems to be blowing through early english historical circles.	4.814296653587412
3728. the	great increase in the amount of archaeological activity and therefore	information in the years immediately preceeding and following the second	world war has brought to light data which has changed the complection	of the saxon shore dispute.	5.4986205957494425
3729. where there were none fifteen years	ago several scholars currently are edging their way cautiously towards	the acceptance of the shore occupied by position.	4.562276164963491
3730. we must	therefore have a look at the new archaeological material and re-examine	the literary and place-name evidence which bears upon the problem.	6.2357399080586475
3731. what exactly are we trying to prove?	6.1298613796617545
3732.  we know that the	saxon shore was a phenonenon of late roman defensive policy; in	other words its existence belongs to the period of roman britain.	5.64004546978759
3733. so	whenever the romans finally withdrew from the island the saxon shore	disappeared in the first decade of the fifth century.	4.7643667594349415
3734. we also know	that the saxon shore as reflected in the notitia was created	as a part of the theodosian reorganization of britain	.	6.520366742773251
3735. my argument is that there was no saxon shore prior to that	time even though the forts had been in existence since the time of carausius.	5.364212384427733
3736. therefore what we must prove or disprove is that there were	saxons in the broad sense in which we must construe the word in	the area of the saxon shore at the time it was called the saxon shore.	5.802120824895193
3737. that is we must find saxons in east anglia kent sussex and	hampshire in the last half of the fourth century.	5.4427328472253445
3738. the problem	in other words is strictly a chronological one.	5.804273692121158
3739. in gaul the saxon	element on its saxon shore was plainly visible because there the	saxons were an intrusive element in the population.	3.9020296841728688
3740. in britain obviously	the archaeological and place-name characteristics of the saxon	shore region are bound to be saxon.	5.639487880205433
3741. it is a matter of trying to	sort out an earlier fourth-century saxon element from the later fifth-century	mainstream of anglo-saxon invasions.	4.644282570427119
3742. this naturally will	be difficult to do since both the archaeological and place-name evidence	in this period with some fortunate exceptions is insufficient	for precise chronological purposes.	5.022249927506418
3743. it might be well to consider	the literary evidence first because it can provide us with an answer	to one important question; namely is the idea that there were saxon	mercenaries in england at all reasonable?	4.122154249574925
3744. 	to do so something was necessary beyond volunteering because there was	little glamour or romance in the european war; it meant instead	hardship dirt and death.	4.96038068518468
3745. baker gave leonard wood credit for	the initiation of the draft of soldiers; from the general's idea	a chain reaction occurred.	3.8880356915934375
3746. wood took the proposal to chief of staff	hugh l scott who passed it on to baker a month before the actual	declaration of war against germany.	4.9944842899864135
3747. the secretary of war gave	his assent after studying the history of the draft in the american	civil war as well as the british volunteer system in world war 1.	4.780455520159121
3748. he concluded that selective service would not only prevent the disorganization	of essential war industries but would avoid the undesirable	moral effects of the british reliance on enlistment only- where	the feeling of the people was whipped into a frenzy by girls pinning	white feathers on reluctant young men orators preaching hate of the	germans and newspapers exaggerating enemy outrages to make men enlist	out of motives of revenge and retaliation.	4.747512427633195
3749. baker took the plan	to wilson who said: baker this is plainly right on any ground.	4.131860641767443
3750. start to prepare the necessary legislation so that if i am obliged	to go to congress the bills will be ready for immediate consideration.	6.125155971560061
3751. the result was that by secret agreement draft machinery was actually	ready long before the country knew that the device was to take	the place of the volunteering method which theodore roosevelt favored.	3.722919338969694
3752. before the draft act was passed baker had confidentially briefed	governors sheriffs and prospective draft board members on the administration	of the measure- and the confidence was kept so well that	only one newspaper learned what was going on.	4.989491283621731
3753. it was baker working	through provost marshal enoch crowder and major hugh s	johnson who arranged for a secret printing by the	million of selective service blanks- again before the act was passed-	until corridors in the government printing office were full	and the basement of the washington post office was stacked to the ceiling.	3.39601533910963
3754. general crowder proposed that regular army officers select	the draftees in cities and towns throughout the nation; it was baker	who thought of lessening the shock which conscription always brings	to a country by substituting greetings from your neighbors for	the recruiting sergeant and registration in familiar voting places	rather than at military installations.	4.47225628332693
3755. even so the draft act	encountered rough sledding in its progress through the congress.	5.1656322938649994
3756. democratic	speaker champ clark saw little difference between a conscript	and a convict.	6.313578918748103
3757. democrat stanley h dent chairman of the	house military affairs committee declined to introduce the bill.	4.131860641767443
3758. democratic floor leader claude kitchin would have no part of the	measure.	6.351780007650003
3759. in the judgment of chief of staff scott it was ironic that	the draft policy of a democratic president aimed at germany had	to be pushed through the house of representatives by the ranking minority	member of the military affairs committee- a republican jew	born in germany! he was julius kahn for whom the chief of staff	thought no honor could be too great.	3.542139112144504
3760. after kahn's death in 1924	scott wrote: may he rest in peace with the eternal gratitude	of his adopted country.	6.064035876480036
3761. in spite of powerful opposition the	draft act finally passed congress on may 17 1917.	4.910098961533947
3762. in early june	ten million young men registered by name and number.	6.36952578460199
3763. the day passed	without incident in spite of the warning of senator james a reed	of missouri: baker you will have the streets of our american	cities running with blood on registration day.	4.311793692789923
3764. on july 20 the	first drawing of numbers occurred in the senate office building before	a distinguished group of congressmen and high army officers.	5.97087538942129
3765. secretary	of war baker blindfolded put his hand into a large glass	bowl and drew the initial number of those to be called.	3.7992019768996257
3766. a man in mississippi wired: thanks for drawing 258- that's	me.	7.658794110349265
3767. he was the first of 2800000 called to the army through the	selective service system.	6.473969954431645
3768. it was one thing to call men to the	colors; it was another to house feed and train them.	5.806340429512213
3769. the existing	army posts were wholly inadequate.	4.863481152584087
3770. in a matter of months the war	department built thirty-two camps each one accommodating fifty thousand	men- sixteen were under canvas in the south and sixteen with frame	structures in the north.	6.036156286893496
3771. it was a gargantuan task; a typical	cantonment in the north had twelve hundred buildings an electric-sewer-water	system and twenty-five miles of roads.	4.5727109070236915
3772. at camp taylor in kentucky	a barracks was built in an hour and a half from timber that had	been standing in mississippi forests one week before.	5.942582802207591
3773. the total	operation	was a construction project comparable in magnitude with the panama	canal but in 1917 time was in short supply; in three months	the army spent three-quarters as much as had been expended on the big	ditch in ten years.	3.65496001305017
3774. in later years josephus danielswas	to	claim that world war 1 was the first in american history in which	there was great concern for both the health and morals of our soldiers.	5.900965816743726
3775. it was the first american war in which the death rate from disease	was lower than that from battle due to the provision of trained	medical personnel compulsory	vaccination rigorous camp sanitation and adequate hospital	facilities.	4.559090241907752
3776. to the middle of september 1918 there had been fewer than	10000 deaths from disease in the new army.	8.163282073179532
3777. this enviable record	would have been maintained but for a great and unexpected disaster which	struck	the world with murderous stealth.	4.002073520551352
3778. it was the influenza pandemic	of 1918-19.	10.19569482407052
3779. the malady was popularly known as the spanish flu	from the alleged locale of its origin.	4.309094164532878
3780. the world-wide total of deaths	from spanish flu was around twenty million; in the united	states 300000 succumbed to it.	5.3193369749789285
3781. in mid-september 1918 the influenza-pneumonia	pandemic swept through every american military camp; during	the eight-week blitz attack 25000 soldiers died from the disease	and the death rate increased almost	fifty times to 4 per week per 1000 men.	3.6086633441991207
3782. in spite of this catastrophe	the final mortality figure from disease in the american army	during world war 1 was 15 per 1000 per year contrasted with	110 per 1000 per year in the mexican war and 65 in the american civil	war.	5.8333892875250974
3783. both secretary of war baker and secretary of navy	daniels devoted much time and effort to the problem of providing	reasonably normal and wholesome activities in camp for the millions of	men who had been removed from their home environment.	4.052879478643481
3784. their policy	ran counter to the traditional idea that a good fighter was usually a	libertine and that in sex affairs god-given passion was a proof	of manliness.	5.370502873146525
3785. baker moved first; six days after war was declared	he appointed raymond fosdick chairman of the commission on training	camp activities.	4.67067137369406
3786. fosdick a brother of minister	harry emerson fosdick was a graduate of princeton and a member of	phi beta kappa and the american philosophical association.	5.785340986586341
3787. his	assignment was not a new one because baker had sent him to the mexican	border in 1916 to investigate lurid newspaper stories about lack	of discipline drunkenness and venereal disease in american military	camps.	3.9664589213220576
3788. fosdick had found the installations surrounded by a battery of	saloons and houses of prostitution with filles de joie from all	over the country flocking to san antonio laredo and el paso to	woman the cribs.	4.720729423757435
3789. he also ascertained that many officers were	indifferent to the problem including commanding general frederick	funston who gave fosdick the nickname of reverend.	4.326506282085711
3790. on the basis	of the long chronicle of military history funston and his brethren	assumed that the issue was insoluble and that anyone interested in a	mission like fosdick's was an impractical idealist or a do-gooder.	5.190897901877469
3791. during the brief mexican venture fosdick's report to the	secretary recommended a definite stand by the war department against	the saloon and the excesses of prostitution.	4.000540513596827
3792. the problem involved military	necessity as much as morality for in pre-penicillin days venereal	disease was a crippling disability.	6.001032136155983
3793. fosdick insisted that a strong	word was needed from washington and it was immediately forthcoming.	4.7890584090463415
3794. baker put the cribs and the saloons out of bounds ordered the	co-operation of military officers with local law authorities and told	communities that the troops would be moved unless wholesome conditions	were restored.	4.8812784238657745
3795. both baker and fosdick knew that a substitute was	necessary that a verboten approach was not the real answer.	4.75370090067133
3796. they	were aware that soldiers went to town in more ways than one because	of the monotony of camp life to find the only release available in	the absence of movies reading rooms and playing fields with adequate	athletic equipment.	5.0449277346884065
3797. both knew that when trains stopped at texan crossroads	bored soldiers would sometimes enter to ask the passengers if	they had any reading material to spare even a newspaper.	3.7787043621853527
3798. there was	no time in the short mexican encounter to evolve a solution but the	area provided a proving ground for new departures in the near future.	6.030842003031511
3799. when the united states entered the first world war baker	made certain that the draft act of 1917 prohibited the sale of liquor	to men in uniform and that it provided for broad zones around the camps	in which prostitution was outlawed.	4.503757028681171
3800. even so fosdick as the new	chairman of the commission on training camp activities encountered	strong and vociferous opposition.	6.465401744694032
3801. new orleans had a notorious red-light	district extending over twenty-eight city blocks and the business-minded	mayor of the city journeyed to washington to present the	case for the god-given right of men to be men.	4.035840061128305
3802. in europe premier	clemenceau showing his animal proclivities as the tiger of	france asked pershing by letter for the creation of special houses	where the sexual desires of american men could be satisfied.	5.102873306457736
3803. when	fosdick showed the letter to baker his negative response was: for	god's sake raymond don't show this to the president or	he'll stop the war.	3.9600219251857176
3804. ultimately fosdick's fit to fight	slogan swept across the country and every well-known red-light district	in the united states was closed a hundred and ten of them.	6.416223040797761
3805. the	result was that the rate of venereal disease in the american army	was the lowest in our military history.	4.911494797967015
3806. this was the negative	side of the situation.	10.12493262960849
3807. affirmatively baker worked on the premise that	young men spontaneously prefer to be decent and that opportunities	for wholesome recreation are the best possible cure for irregularities	in conduct which arise from idleness and the baser temptations.	3.649478332160865
3808. the wholesome activities were to be provided by many organizations including	the ymca the knights of columbus the jewish welfare	board the american library association and the playground and	recreation association- private societies which voluntarily performed	the job that was taken over almost entirely by the special services	division of the army itself in world war 2.	4.685662555494843
3809. over these	voluntary agencies in 1917-18 the ctca served as a co-ordinating	body in carrying out what survey called the most stupendous	piece of social work in modern times.	3.9977050167218504
3810. under fosdick the first	executive officer of the ctca was richard byrd whose name in	later years was to become synonymous with activities at the polar antipodes.	5.456235603148095
3811. from the point of view of popularity the best-known member of	the commission was walter camp the yale athlete whose sobriquet	was the father of american football.	4.371465798084362
3812. he was placed in charge of	athletics and among other things adapted the type of calisthenics known	as the daily dozen.	6.297142769622798
3813. the ctca program of activities was profuse:	william farnum and mary pickford on the screen elsie janis	and harry lauder on the stage books provided by the american	library association full equipment for games and sports- except that	no bones were furnished for the all-time favorite pastime played	on any floor and known as african golf.	3.4035348439651054
3814. the ctca distributed	a khaki-bound songbook that provided the impetus for spirited	renditions of the selections found therein plus a number of others	whose lyrics were more earthy- from johnny get your gun to	keep the home fires burning to mademoiselle from armentieres.	4.673529563815876
3815. in the imagination of the nineteenth century the greek tragedians and	shakespeare stand side by side their affinity transcending all the	immense contrarieties of historical circumstance religious belief and	poetic form.	4.3520163814366475
3816. we no longer use the particular terms of lessing	and victor hugo.	7.103409871375322
3817. but we abide by their insight.	7.245967085364206
3818. the word tragedy	encloses for us in a single span both the greek and the elizabethan	example.	6.226766259705523
3819. the sense of relationship overreaches the historical	truth that shakespeare may have known next to nothing of the actual	works of aeschylus sophocles and euripides.	3.900435537414337
3820. it transcends the	glaring fact that the elizabethans mixed tragedy and comedy whereas	the greeks kept the two modes severely distinct.	6.157208005971952
3821. it overcomes our emphatic	awareness of the vast difference in the shape and fabric of the	two languages and styles of dramatic presentation.	4.564876999034132
3822. the intimations of	a related spirit and ordering of human values are stronger than any	sense of disparity.	5.055834108035586
3823. comparable visions of life are at work in antigone	and romeo and juliet.	4.44623081023859
3824. we see at once what victor hugo	means when he calls macbeth a northern scion of the house of atreus.	6.419256877299806
3825. elsinore seems to lie in a range of mycenae and the fate of orestes	resounds in that of hamlet.	4.313727488482366
3826. the hounds of hell search out their	quarry in apollo's sanctuary as they do in the tent of richard 3.	5.563334284693604
3827. oedipus and lear attain similar insights by virtue of similar blindness.	4.915742579218304
3828. it it not between euripides and shakespeare that the western	mind turns away from the ancient tragic sense of life.	6.151536711416233
3829. it is after	the late seventeenth century.	6.369103552136101
3830. i say the late seventeenth century because	racine stands on the far side	of the chasm.	6.740819528912415
3831. the image of man which enters into force with aeschylus	is still vital in phedre and athalie.	4.3038201301335794
3832. it is the	triumph of rationalism and secular metaphysics which marks the point	of no return.	6.042787388981278
3833. shakespeare is closer to sophocles than he is to pope	and voltaire.	5.84137025035292
3834. to say this is to set aside the realness of time.	7.933955079280243
3835. but	it is true nevertheless.	8.182661958516757
3836. the modes of the imagination implicit in	athenian tragedy continued to shape the life of the mind until the age	of descartes and newton.	6.014026432411453
3837. it is only then that the ancient habits	of feeling and the classic orderings of material and psychological experience	were abandoned.	4.505578472027409
3838. with the discours de la methode and the	principia the things undreamt of in horatio's philosophy seem	to pass from the world.	5.657336156259289
3839. in greek tragedy as in shakespeare	mortal actions are encompassed by forces which transcend man.	4.372035985590015
3840. the reality	of orestes entails that of the furies; the weird sisters wait	for the soul of macbeth.	5.7752618271394605
3841. we cannot conceive of oedipus without a	sphinx nor of hamlet without a ghost.	4.858948580902031
3842. the shadows cast by the personages	of greek and shakespearean drama lengthen into a greater darkness.	5.278941414645402
3843. and the entirety of the natural world is party to the action.	5.5482010238626165
3844. the thunderclaps over the sacred wood at colonus and the storms in	king lear are caused by more than weather.	5.016117313500866
3845. in tragedy lightning	is a messenger.	6.563387531333404
3846. but it can no longer be so once benjamin franklin	has flown a kite to it.	7.599194905694129
3847. the	tragic stage is a platform extending precariously between heaven and	hell.	4.681571082223364
3848. those who walk on it may encounter at any turn ministers of grace	or damnation.	6.466446625114355
3849. oedipus and lear instruct us how little of	the world belongs to man.	4.411891185517149
3850. mortality is the pacing of a brief and dangerous	watch and to all sentinels whether at elsinore or on the battlements	at mycenae the coming of dawn has its breath of miracle.	5.12557429762256
3851. it	banishes the night wanderers to fire or repose.	5.066959048406199
3852. but at the touch of	hume and voltaire the noble or hideous visitations which had haunted	the mind since agamemnon's blood cried out for vengeance disappeared	altogether or took tawdry refuge among the gaslights of melodrama.	5.100479412001086
3853. modern roosters have lost the art of crowing restless spirits back to	purgatory.	5.262433965344327
3854. in athens in shakespeare's england and at	versailles the hierarchies of worldly power were stable and manifest.	5.639487880205433
3855. the wheel of social life spun around the royal or aristocratic centre.	4.173800338879276
3856. from it spokes of order and degree led to the outward rim of the	common man.	6.711725931294292
3857. tragedy presumes such a configuration.	6.094118058689911
3858. its sphere is that	of royal courts dynastic quarrels and vaulting ambitions.	6.642097980968847
3859. the same	metaphors of swift ascent and calamitous decline apply to oedipus	and macbeth because they applied also to alcibiades and essex.	3.6061566743622318
3860. and	the fate of such men has tragic relevance because it is public.	6.959613018790671
3861. agamemnon	creon and medea perform their tragic actions before the eyes	of the polis.	4.411891185517149
3862. similarly the sufferings of hamlet othello	or phedre engage the fortunes of the state.	6.168487314790686
3863. they are enacted at the	heart of the body politic.	6.500923153154542
3864. hence the natural setting of tragedy is the	palace gate the public square or the court chamber.	5.918570800985123
3865. greek and elizabethan	life and to a certain extent the life of versailles shared	this character of intense publicity.	4.440538099249936
3866. princes and factions clashed	in the open street and died on the open scaffold.	6.16177302337585
3867. with the	rise to power of the middle class the centre of gravity in human affairs	shifted from the public to the private.	5.164893450953947
3868. the art of defoe and richardson	is founded on an awareness of this great change.	5.954339018363231
3869. heretofore	an action had possessed the breadth of tragedy only if it involved high	personages and if it occurred in the public view.	4.53189712694044
3870. behind the tragic	hero stands the chorus the crowd or the observant courtier.	6.1692635755637975
3871. in the	eighteenth century there emerges for the first time the notion of a	private tragedy	number of elizabethan domestic tragedies such as the famous arden	.	4.70214174645063
3872. in la nouvelle-heloi^se and werther	tragedy is made intimate.	7.196162898152894
3873. and private tragedy became the chosen ground	not of drama but of the new unfolding art of the novel.	5.300436392515403
3874. the novel was not only the presenter of the new secular rationalistic	private world of the middle class.	7.669298615693461
3875. it served also as a literary form	exactly appropriate to the fragmented audience of modern urban culture.	4.395235068682567
3876. i have said before how difficult it is to make any precise statements	with regard to the character of the greek and elizabethan public.	7.777391549341244
3877. but one major fact seems undeniable.	7.055910750451842
3878. until the advent of rational	empiricism the controlling habits of the western mind were symbolic	and allegoric.	6.800215055052948
3879. available evidence regarding the natural world the	course of history and the varieties of human action were translated	into imaginative designs or mythologies.	3.873377036453748
3880. classic mythology and christianity	are such architectures of the imagination.	6.522871687113793
3881. they order the manifold	levels of reality and moral value along an axis of being which	extends from brute matter to the immaculate stars.	3.881607703916464
3882. there had not yet	supervened between understanding and expression the new languages of	mathematics and scientific formulas.	6.6660714807902375
3883. the poet was by definition a realist	his imaginings and parables being natural organizations of reality.	3.8146432153167833
3884. and in these organizations certain primal notions played a radiant	part radiant both in the sense of giving light and of being a pole	toward which all perspectives converge.	5.945964500922529
3885. i mean such concepts as the presence	of the supernatural in human affairs the sacraments of grace	and divine retribution the idea of preordainment	the prophecy of the witches to macbeth or god's covenant with	.	3.871494540769782
3886. i refer to the notion that the structure	of society is a microcosm of the cosmic design and that history	conforms to patterns of justice and chastisement as if it were a morality	play set in motion by the gods for our instruction.	5.299641353110235
3887. these	conceptions and the manner in which they were transposed into poetry or	engendered by poetic form are intrinsic to western life from the time	of aeschylus to that of shakespeare.	4.379825355362419
3888. and although they were as i	have indicated under increasing strain at the time of racine they	are still alive in his theatre.	6.307685972170698
3889. they are the essential force behind	the conventions of tragedy.	6.197778191328081
3890. they are as decisively present in the oresteia	and oedipus as in macbeth king lear and phedre.	6.339834855935751
3891. after the seventeenth century the audience ceased to	be an organic community to which these ideas and their attendant habits	of figurative language would be natural or immediately familiar.	3.8919756588255336
3892. concepts	such as grace damnation purgation blasphemy or the chain of	being which are everywhere implicit in classic and shakespearean tragedy	lose their vitality.	5.103675880876918
3893. they become philosophic abstractions of	a private and problematic relevance or mere catchwords in religious customs	which had in them a diminishing part of active belief.	3.802025626992866
3894. after shakespeare	the master spirits of western consciousness are no longer	the blind seers the poets or orpheus performing his art in the face	of hell.	5.294969244618011
3895. they are descartes newton and voltaire.	6.8027327880263675
3896. and their chroniclers	are not the dramatic poets but the prose novelists.	6.6419685246560425
3897. the	romantics were the immediate inheritors of this tremendous change.	4.855658467968249
3898. they were not yet prepared to accept it as irremediable.	9.064343074701084
3899. rousseau's	primitivism the anti-newtonian mythology of blake coleridge's	organic metaphysics victor hugo's image of the poets as the magi	and shelley's unacknowledged legislators are related elements	in the rear-guard action fought by the romantics against the new	scientific rationalism.	3.607607377986237
3900. from this action sprang the idea of somehow uniting	greek and shakespearean drama into a new total form capable	of restoring to life the ancient moral and poetic responses.	5.6381900673048655
3901. the dream	of achieving a synthesis between the sophoclean and the shakespearean	genius inspired the ambitions of poets and composers from the time	of shelley and victor hugo to that of bayreuth.	3.5827438200308235
3902. it could not really	be fulfilled.	11.68409790867645
3903. the conventions into which the romantics tried to breath	life no longer corresponded to the realities of thought and feeling.	3.95137208120356
3904. but the attempt itself produced a number of brilliant works and	these form a transition from the early romantic period to the new age	of ibsen and chekhov.	6.251667502126533
3905. the wedding of the hellenic to the northern	genius was one of the dominant motifs in goethe's thought.	4.3614936962717925

3909. goethe believed that the germanic spirit with its	grave strength but flagrant streaks of brutality and intolerance should	be tempered with the old sensuous wisdom and humanism of the hellenic.	3.642767181284866
3910. on the narrower ground of poetic form he felt that in the drama	of the future the greek conception of tragic fate should be joined to	the shakespearean vision of tragic will.	5.4852625645013235
3911. the wager between god and	satan brings on the destiny of faust but faust assumes his role	voluntarily.	3.801129934204088
3912. the third act of faust 2 is a formal celebration	of the union between the germanic and the classic between	the spirit of euripides and that of romantic drama.	4.929687652654643
3913. the motif of faust's	love for helen of troy goes back to the sources of the faustian	legend.	4.99303862772145
3914. it tells us of the ancient human desire to see the highest	wisdom joined to the highest sensual beauty.	6.675797984165205
3915. there can be no greater	magic than to wrest from death her in whom the flesh was all in whom	beauty was entirely pure because it was entirely corruptible.	4.432162621464411
3916. it is	thus that the brightness of helen passes through marlowe's faustus.	6.8627048547183565
3917. goethe used the fable to more elaborate ends.	5.066959048406199
3918. faust rescuing	helen from menelaus' vengeance is the genius of renaissance europe	restoring to life the classic tradition.	5.454336586728915
3919. the necromantic change from	the palace at sparta to faust's gothic castle directs us to the	aesthetic meaning of the myth- the translation of antique drama into	shakespearean and romantic guise.	3.581430223420508
3920. this translation or rather	the fusion of the two ideals creates the gesamtkunstwerk	the total art form.	6.285062174445867
3921. the bishop of gloucester described the elder thomas in 1577 as the	richest recusant in his diocese worth five hundred pounds a year in	lands and goods.	3.4757355708806807

3934. greville proposed quiney as	the fittest man for the following of the cause and to attend him in	the matter and at his suggestion the corporation allowed quiney	two shillings a day.	5.292511200430669

3986. a report of	f edw: grevyles minaces to the baileefe aldermen + burgesses	of stratforde tells how quiney was injured by greville's men:	in the tyme f ryc' quyney was bayleefe ther came some of	them whoe beinge druncke fell to braweling in ther hosts howse wher	thei druncke + drewe ther dagers uppon the hoste: att a faier tyme the	baileefe being late abroade to see the towne in order + comminge by	in	f hurley burley.	4.40276846315524

3988. the fall of rome the discovery of precious metals and the protestant	reformation were all links and could only be explained and understood	by comprehending the links that preceded and those that followed.	4.735103731299851
3989. often the historian must consider the use of intuition or instinct	by those individuals or nations which he is studying.	4.863541221319791
3990. unconsciously	governments or races or institutions may enter into some undertaking	without fully realizing why they are doing so.	5.487755484166036
3991. they react in obedience	to an instinct or urge which has itself been impelled by natural	law.	4.314931266205686
3992. a court may strike down a law on the basis of an intuitive feeling	that the law is inimical to the numerical majority.	5.7079822035037315
3993. a nation may	go to war on some trifling pretext when in reality it may have been	guided by an unconscious instinct that its very life was at stake.	3.736394436069532
3994. when	the historian encounters a situation in which he can perceive no visible	cause and effect sequence he should be alert to intuition and unconscious	instinct as possible guides.	5.616121790712761
3995. adams firmly contended	that the historian must never underrate the impact of the geographical	environment on history.	4.320280166246067
3996. here was another indispensable tool.	10.928100145593751
3997. indeed	he concluded that geographical conditions have exercised a great	possibly a preponderating influence over man's destiny.	4.131860641767443
3998. the failure	of greece to reach the imperial destiny that periclean athens	had seemed to promise was almost directly attributable to her physical	conformation.	5.089832262427427
3999. all areas of history were either favorably or adversely	affected by the geographical environment and no respectable historian	could pursue the study of history without a thorough knowledge of	geography.	4.049366058936784
4000. brooks adams was consistent in his admonishments	to historians about the necessary tools or insights they needed to possess.	5.330107587139294
4001. however as a practicing historian he himself has left few clues	to the amount of professional scholarship that he used when writing	history.	4.4835289737741215
4002. in fact if judgments are to be rendered upon the soundness	of his historicism they must be based on scanty evidence.	6.5787522500341
4003. what evidence	is available would seem to indicate that brooks unlike his older	brother henry had most of the methodological vices usually found	in the amateur.	4.952030733551955
4004. a credulousness a distaste for documentation an uncritical	reliance on contemporary accounts and a proneness to assume	a theory as true before adequate proof was provided were all evidences	of his failure to comprehend the use of the scientific method or to evaluate	the responsibilities of the historian to his reading public.	4.825261715055857
4005. this	is not to assume that his work was without merit but the validity	of his assumptions concerning the meaning of history must always be	considered against this background of an unprofessional approach.	4.057305008294136
4006. his credulity is perhaps best illustrated in his introduction to the	emancipation of massachusetts which purports to examine the	trials of moses and to draw a parallel between the leader of the israelite	exodus from egypt and the leadership of the puritan clergy in	colonial new england.	5.116539246582347
4007. much criticism has been leveled at this rather	forced analogy but what is equally significant is adams' complete	acceptance of the biblical record as good and trustworthy history.	4.05923726992119
4008. in light of the scholarly reappraisals engendered by the higher	criticism this is a most remarkable statement particularly coming	from one who was well known for his antifundamentalist views.	6.142413653011752
4009. the desire	to substantiate a thesis at the expense of sound research technique	smacks more of	the propagandist than the historian.	4.00562759368656
4010. a similar amateurish	characteristic is revealed in adams' failure to check the	accuracy and authenticity of his informational sources.	5.450107870776621
4011. if he found data	that fitted his general plan he used it and counted his sources trustworthy.	4.749687296638134
4012. conversely if statistics were uncovered which contradicted	a cherished theory the sources were denounced as faulty.	5.550554466109728
4013. such manipulations	are frequently encountered in his essay on the suppression	of the monasteries during the english reformation.	4.414160373195987
4014. adams depended largely	on the dispatches of foreign ambassadors and observers in england	claiming that the reports of such agents had to be accurate because	there were no newspapers.	5.405104860535776
4015. this is certainly an irrational dogmatism	in which the modern mind attempts to understand the spirit of the sixteenth	century on twentieth-century terms.	4.9119709013660815
4016. moreover he rejects the	contemporary accounts of englishmen casually adjudging them to be distorted	by prejudice because the opinions of englishmen are of no	great value.	5.492407580073311
4017. what is exposited by this observation is not the inherent	prejudices of englishmen but the anglophobia of brooks adams.	4.909174359834339
4018. in all fairness it must be admitted that adams made no pretense	at being an impartial historian.	6.8181704509232075
4019. impartiality to him meant an unwillingness	to generalize and to search for a synthesis.	4.448360245327874
4020. he deplored the	impact of german historiography on the writing of history terming	it a dismal monster.	5.751746395508077
4021. ranke and his disciples had reduced history	to a profession of dullness; brooks adams preferred the chronicles	of froissart or the style and theorizing of edward gibbon for	at least they took a stand on the issues about which they wrote.	3.458812742490038
4022. he wrote	eloquently to william james that impartial history was not only	impossible but undesirable.	5.948670829384279
4023. if the historian was convinced of his own	correctness then he should not allow his vision to become fogged by	disturbing facts.	4.2798809214220475
4024. it was history that must be in error not the historian.	6.971007363091392
4025. it was this basic trait that separated adams from the ranks	of professional historians and led him to commit time and time again what	was his most serious offense against the historical method- namely	the tendency to assume the truth of an hypothesis before submitting	it to the test of facts.	3.5576310832928124
4026. all of adams' work reflects this	dogmatic characteristic.	9.148868804219276
4027. no page seems to be complete without the statement	of at least one unproved generalization.	5.767094051023303
4028. one example of this	was his assertion that h all servile revolts must be dealt with by	physical force.	6.010876257963926
4029. there is no explanation of terms nor a qualification	that most such revolts have been dealt with by force- only a bald	dogmatism that they must because of some undefined compulsion be	so repelled.	3.903399556530306
4030. on matters of race he was similarly inflexible: most	of the modern latin races seem to have inherited h the rigidity	of the roman mind.	5.799478682271596
4031. he cites the french revolution as typifying	this rigidity but makes no mention of the italians who have been able	to	adapt to all types of circumstances.	4.219592710530442
4032. he pontificates that one	of the first signs of advancing civilization is the fall in the value	of women in men's eyes.	5.517285395048556
4033. it made no difference that most evidence	points to an opposite conclusion.	5.298715808955571
4034. for adams had made up his mind before	all the facts were available.	6.323738128928239
4035. all critics of adams and	his methods have observed this particular deficiency.	4.976568044153196
4036. j t shotwell	was appalled by such spurious history as that which attributed the	fall of the carolingian empire to the woolen trade and he urged adams	to transform his essay into a real history embodying not merely	those facts which fit into his theory but also the modifications	and exceptions.	4.664099410113018
4037. a m wergeland called the adams method literally	antihistorical while clive day maintained that the assumptions	were not confined to theories alone but were also applicable to straight	factual evidence.	3.72725939352501
4038. moreover stated day he always omits	facts which tend to disprove his hypothesis.	6.607120211838668
4039. even d a wasson	who compared the emancipation of massachusetts to the lifting	of a fog from ancient landscapes was also forced to admit the methodological	deficiencies of the author.	3.844334976769817
4040. in summary brooks adams	felt that the nature of history was order and that the order so discovered	was as much subject to historical laws as the forces of nature.	5.8453136137545725
4041. moreover he believed that most professional historians lacked some	of the essential instruments for a proper study of history.	4.503482051369168
4042. however	despite the insight of many of his observations his own conclusions	are open to suspicion because of his failure to employ at all times the	correct research methods.	5.777854497685512
4043. this should not prejudice an evaluation of	his findings but they were not the findings of a completely impartial	investigator.	4.455720521803332
4044. what was perhaps more important than his concept of	the nature of history and the historical method were those forces which	shaped the direction of his thought.	6.265438214721686
4045. in the final analysis his contribution	to american historiography was founded on almost intuitive insights	into religion economics and darwinism the three factors which	conditioned his search for a law of history.	3.9707313957589285
4046. brooks adams considered religion as an extremely significant	manifestation of man's fear of the unknown.	5.709233643418992
4047. but it was nothing	more than that.	8.543063809728357
4048. religion and the churches were institutions which	had been created by man not god.	5.949282378381776
4049. he did not deny god; he simply	did not believe that a creator intervened or interfered in human	affairs.	4.891655062494059
4050. the historian need not be concerned with the philosophical problems	suggested by religion.	6.832007516598666
4051. there was no evidence either of a positive	or negative type of the actions of a divine being in this world;	and since the historian should only be interested in strictly terrestrial	activity his research should eliminate the supernatural.	3.8970790287109995
4052. furthermore	he must regard religion as the expression of human forces.	6.289010577019261
4053. certainly he must recognize its power and attempt to ascertain its	influence on the flow of history but he must not confuse the natural	and the mundane with the divine.	3.939507862722654
4054. adams was not breaking new ground	when he claimed that the worship of an unseen power was in reality	a reflection of man's inability to cope with his environment.	5.061901042242228
4055. students	of anthropology and comparative religion had long been aware that	there was indeed a direct connection.	4.4571669282377435
4056. but adams was one of the first	to suggest that this human incompetence was the only motivating factor	behind religion.	7.015820651860829
4057. it was this fear which explained the development	of a priestly caste whose function in society was to mollify and appease	the angry deities.	4.06109563121252
4058. to keep themselves entrenched in power the	priests were forced to demonstrate their unique status through the miracle.	5.839175435567466
4059. it was the use of the supernatural that kept them in business.	7.122087681362724
4060. the german barbarians of the fourth century offered an excellent example:	the germans in the fourth century were a very simple	race who comprehended little of natural laws and who therefore referred	phenomena they did not understand to supernatural intervention.	4.930501694642445
4061. this intervention could only be controlled by priests and thus the	invasions caused a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred class.	4.2800231654883
4062. the	power of every ecclesiastical organization has always rested on the	miracle and the clergy have always proved their divine commission as	did elijah.	5.103675880876918
4063. adams contended that once such a special class	had been created it became a vested interest and sought to maintain	itself by assuming exclusive control over the relationships between	god and man.	3.6777050603077264
4064. thus the church was born and because of its intrinsic	character was soon identified as a conservative institution determined	to resist the forces of change to identify itself with the political	rulers and to maintain a kind of splendid isolation from the masses.	5.367982387596957
4065. doctrine was not only mysterious; it was also sacred and no	believer in an inspired church could tolerate having her canons examined	as we should examine human laws.	3.812942795579638
4066. these basic ideas concerning the	nature of religion were adams believed some of the major keys to	the understanding of history and the movement of society.	6.1577313537872245
4067. the dark views	about the puritans found in the emancipation of massachusetts	were never altered.	4.545642707840417
4068. despite their adherence to the status	quo the forces of organized religion were compelled to make adjustments	as increasing civilization augmented human knowledge.	5.678067057088451
4069. in the	law of civilization and decay brooks adams traced this evolution	always pointing to the fact that although the forms became more	rational the substance remained unchanged.	4.2725135484000525
4070. the relic worship and monasticism	of the middle ages were more advanced forms than were primitive	fetish worship and nature myths.	4.889557281264576
4071. yet the idea imbedded in each	was identical: to surround the unknown with mystery and to isolate that	class which had been given special dominion over the secrets of god.	4.271634462321857
4072. to adams that age in which religion exercised power over the entire	culture of the race was one of imagination and it is largely the	admiration he so obviously held for such eras that betrays a peculiar	religiosity- a sentiment he would have probably denied.	5.713219608831399
4073. stephens had written his classic incidents of travel about these	regions a hundred years before and catherwood who had studied piranesi	in london and the great ruins of egypt and greece had drawn	the splendid illustrations that accompanied the text.	3.5101554846447294
4074. catherwood an	architect in new york had been forgotten like stephens and victor	reconstructed their lives as one reconstructs for a museum a dinosaur	from two or three petrified bones.	5.506899966938576
4075. he had unearthed stephens's	letters in a new jersey farmhouse and he discovered stephens's	unmarked grave in an old cemetery on the east side of new york where	the great traveller had been hastily buried during a cholera epidemic.	4.301969966981847
4076. victor had been stirred by my account of him in makers and finders	for stephens was one of the lost writers whom melville had seen	in his childhood and whom i was bent on resurrecting.	5.205084375595997
4077. victor	had led an adventurous life.	6.094118058689911
4078. his metier was the american tropics	and he had lived all over latin america and among the primitive	tribes on the amazon river.	5.294773875527992
4079. well he knew the sleepless nights the howling	sore-ridden dogs and the biting insects in the villages of the	kofanes and huitotoes.	4.445740059061079
4080. he had not yet undertaken the great exploit	of his later years the rediscovery of the ancient inca highway the	route of pizarro in peru but he had climbed to the original el dorado	the andean lake of guatemala and he had scaled the southern sierra	nevada with its tibetan-like people and looked into the emerald	mines of muzo.	4.884457294066843
4081. as a naturalist living for two years at the headwaters	of the amazon he had collected specimens for mexican museums	and he had taken to the london zoo a live quetzal the sacred bird of	the old mayans.	3.827953749068563
4082. in fact he had raised quetzal birds in his camp in	the forest of ecuador.	6.721852922742723
4083. moreover he had spent six months on the galapagos	islands among the great turtles that captain cook had found	there and now and then he would disappear into some small island of	the west indies.	4.034564293968865
4084. victor's book on john lloyd stephens was largely	written in my study in the house at weston.	6.180323019972321
4085. i had had my	name taken out of the telephone book and this was partly because of	a convict who had been discharged from sing sing and who called me night	after night.	4.804366634691633
4086. he said he was a friend of heywood broun who had	run a free employment bureau for several months during the depression	but the generous broun to whom i wrote did not know his name and i	somehow conceived the morbid notion that the man in question was prowling	round the house.	5.381376248770706
4087. but one day came the voice of a man i had known	when he was a boy and i later remembered that this boy thirty years	before had struck me as coming to no good.	4.3608637212488475
4088. there had been something	sinister about him that warned me against him- i had never felt	that way about any other boy- but when he uttered his name on the	telephone i had forgotten this and i was glad to do what he asked of	me.	5.1876445182024975
4089. he was a captain he said in the army and on the train to new	york his purse and all his money had been stolen and would i lend	him twenty-five dollars to be given him at the general delivery window?	4.4961076852099575
4090. 	never hearing from him again i remembered the little boy of whom	i had had such doubts when he was ten years old.	5.787702857805998
4091. we lived for a	while in a movie melodrama with a german cook and her son who turned	out to be nazis.	4.141497356379314
4092. finally we got them out of the house after the boy	had run away four times looking for other nazis threatening to murder	village schoolchildren and bragging that he was to be the next fu^hrer.	7.427247448224627
4093. then he began to have epileptic fits.	7.9109548562242
4094. we found that a charitable	society in new york had a long case-history of the two; and	they agreed to see that the tragic pair would not put poison in anybody	else's soup.	6.100896770900429
4095. to the weston house came once william allen	neilson the president of smith college who had been one of my old	professors and who still called me boy when i was sixty.	4.48493526997328
4096. it	reminded me of my other professor edward kennard rand of whom i	had been so fond when i was at harvard the great mediaevalist and	classical scholar who had asked me to call him ken saying age	counts for nothing among those who have learned to know life sub	specie aeternitatis.	4.858177856550311
4097. i had always thought of that lovable man	as many years older than myself although he was perhaps only twenty	years older and he confirmed my feeling along with the feeling of both	my sons that teachers of the classics are invariably endearing.	3.9132617798003393
4098. i	must have written to say how much i had enjoyed his fine book the	building	of eternal rome and i found he had not regretted giving	me the highest mark in his old course on the later latin poets although	in my final examination i had ignored the questions and filled the	bluebook with a comparison of propertius and coleridge.	4.519115271643187
4099. he had written	to me about a dinner he had had with the benedictine monks at st	anselm's priory in washington.	4.261586564717299
4100. there had been reading at table	especially from two books pope gregory the great's account	of st scholastica in his dialogues and my own the world	of washington irving.	5.64278453857777
4101. he said some have criticized your book	as	being neither literary criticism nor history.	5.152069174854801
4102. of course it was not	meant to be.	9.342525898394568
4103. some have felt that washington irving comes out rather	slimly but let them look at the title of the book.	5.1221953093782275
4104. he felt as	i felt about this best of all my books that it was really tops.	6.708663149386469
4105. two or three times c c burlingham came to lunch with	us in weston that wonderful man who lived to be more than a hundred	years old and whose birthplace had been my wall street suburb.	4.312428619688429
4106. his	reading ranged from agatha christie to the book of job and he had	an insatiable interest in his fellow-creatures while his letters were	full of gossip about new politicians and old men of letters with whom	he had been intimately thrown six decades before.	4.53501226182683
4107. i could never forget	the gaiety with which when he was both blind and deaf he let me	lead him around his rooms to look at some of the pictures; and once	when he came to see us in new york he walked away in a rainstorm	unwilling to hear of a taxi or even an umbrella although he was at the	time ninety years old.	3.9628329392747563
4108. there were several men of ninety or more whom	i knew first or last all of whom were still productive and most of	whom knew one another as if they had naturally come together at the apex	of their lives.	5.695981083738854
4109. i never met john dewey whose style was a sort	of verbal fog and who had written asking me to go to mexico with him	when he was investigating the cause of trotsky; but i liked to think	of him at ninety swimming and working at key west long after hemingway	had moved to cuba.	3.766090667080789
4110. at lee simonson's house i had dined	with edith hamilton the nonogenarian rationalist and the charming scholar	who had a great popular success with the greek way.	5.227925740626208
4111. then	there was mark howe and there was henry dwight sedgwick an accomplished	man of letters who wrote in the spirit of montaigne and produced	in the end a formidable body of work.	4.093035061517432
4112. i saw sedgwick often before	his death at ninety-five- he had remarried at the age of ninety-	and he asked me when once i returned from rome if i knew the	cavallinis in the church of st cecilia in trastevere.	5.757066804692915
4113. i had to	confess that i had missed these frescoes recently discovered that	he had studied in his eighties.	4.797728574238062
4114. sedgwick had chosen to follow the philosophy	of epicurus whom with his followers dante put in hell; but	he defended the doctrine in the art of happiness and what indeed	could be said against the epicurean virtues health frugality	privacy culture and friendship?	4.9286452286135765
4115.  of mark antony de wolfe howe	the philosopher whitehead said the earth's first visitors to mars	should be persons likely to make a good impression and when he was	asked whom would you send?	4.088210921319113
4116.  he replied my first choice	would be mark howe.	7.08339902922487
4117. this friend of many years came once to visit	us in the house at weston.	4.934658734225221
4118. then i spoke at the ninetieth birthday	party of w e burghardt du bois who embarked on a fictional	trilogy at eighty-nine and who with the crisis had created a	negro intelligentsia that had never existed in america before him.	4.8744813627654
4119. as	their interpreter and guide he had broken with tuskegee and become	a spokesman of the coloured people of the world.	4.265227642322565
4120. mr burlingham-	ccb- wrote to me once about an old friend	of mine s k ratcliffe whom i had first met in london in	1914 and who also came out for a week-end in weston.	4.991726736804874
4121. did you ever	know a man with greater zest for information?	5.775650452920551
4122.  and his memory like	an elephant's stored with precise knowledge of men and things and	happenings.	5.91615253091577
4123. his wife katie as gay as a lark and as lively	as a gazelle- she was then seventy-six- had a a sense of humour	that has been denied sk but neither has any aesthetic perceptions.	3.811275831587712
4124. people and books are enough for them.	8.740990593375543
4125. sk was visiting	ccb and not waiting for breakfast he was off to	the university club where he spent hours writing obituaries of living	americans for the manchester guardian or the glasgow herald.	3.6102854695297104
4126. later rising ninety he was beset by publishers for the story	of his life and miracles as he put it but calling himself the needy	knife-grinder he had spent his time writing short articles and long	letters and could not get even a small popular book done.	4.89292382463467
4127. then all	but blind he said there was nothing in back to methuselah-	gbs ought to have known that- and i look at my	bookshelves despairingly knowing that i can have nothing more to do	with them.	3.7493893349875664
4128. however at eighty-five he had still been busy writing	articles reviewing and speaking and i had never before known an	englishman who had visited and lectured in three quarters of the united	states.	5.085105572414964
4129. finally colleges and clubs took the line that speakers	from england were not wanted any longer even speakers like sk	so unlike the novelists and poets who had patronized the americans	for many years.	3.7164553682603296
4130. with their facile generalizations about the united	states these mediocrities as they often were had been great successes.	6.175806336611384
4131. while sk did not like dylan thomas i liked his poems	very much but i made the mistake of telling dylan thomas so whereupon	he said to me i suppose you think you know all about me.	3.7085937239926596
4132. i should have replied i probably know something about the best	part of you.	6.440100196562895
4133. but i only thought of that in the middle of the night.	7.497293135925392
4134. many years later i went to see sk in england where	he was living at whiteleaf near aylesbury and he showed me beside	his cottage there the remains of the road on which boadicea is supposed	to have travelled.	5.471194984467331
4135. he was convinced that george orwell's 1984	was nearly all wrong as it applied to england which was driving	forward into uncharted waters with the danger of a new tyranny	ahead.	4.257038784394321
4136. but however we go whatever our doom it will not take the	orwellian shape.	6.959138571872008
4137. with facts mainly in his mind he was often acute	in the matter of style and he said the young who have as yet	nothing to say will try larks with initial letters and broken lines.	4.324596816025357
4138. but put them before a situation which they are forced to depict-	he was speaking of the spanish civil war- and they have no hesitation;	they merely do their best to make it real for others.	5.808578605378935
4139. he looked at her as she spoke then got up as she was speaking still	and simply and wordlessly walked out.	4.096342730383724
4140. and that was the end.	14.298973311964215
4141. he went to the hotel mayflower and telegraphed mencken.	7.405478258432553
4142. would he meet him in baltimore in drawing room a car three	on the train leaving washington at nine o'clock next morning?	5.5814809504505565
4143. 	they would go to new york together where parties would be piled on	weariness and on misery.	4.487172502531329
4144. both alfred harcourt and	donald brace had written him enthusiastic praise of elmer gantry	and they had ordered 140000 copies- the largest first	printing of any book in history.	5.120391278621546
4145. but none of this could soothe the	exacerbated nerves.	5.731070394473999
4146. on new year's eve alfred harcourt drove	him up the hudson to bill brown's training camp a well-known establishment	for the speedy if temporary rehabilitation of drunkards who	could no longer help themselves.	5.0213788646603215
4147. but in departing lewis begged	breasted that there be no liquor in the apartment at the grosvenor on	his return and he took with him the first thirty galleys of elmer	gantry.	4.0516888103518705
4148. on january 4 with the boys back at school and college	mrs lewis wrote harcourt to say that she was thro quite	thro.	6.701443080097305
4149. this whole washington venture was my last gesture	and it has failed.	4.881734066236805
4150. physically as well as mentally i have reached the	limit of my endurance.	7.129298937943255
4151. my last gift to him is complete silence until	the book is out and the first heated discussion dies down.	4.635990593077307
4152. for him to	divorce god and wife simultaneously would be bad publicity.	6.788079023649843
4153. i am	really ill at the present moment and i will go to some sort of a sanitarium	to normalize myself.	4.9917816062899165
4154. and she withdrew then to cromwell	hall in cromwell connecticut.	7.500466201090954
4155. harcourt replied: i do	really hope you can achieve serenity in the course of time.	4.795212201633432
4156. of course	i hope hal can also but those hopes are much more faint.	6.523340319634172
4157. on january 8 1927 he returned to the grosvenor in high	spirits and looking fit.	5.507616975048887
4158. he had been he wrote mencken at once in	the country a euphemism for an experience that had not greatly	changed him.	6.2414909988125
4159. charles breasted remembers that before unpacking his bag	he telephoned his bootlegger with a generous order and almost at	once the familiar procession of people began milling through our living	room at any hour between two pm and three am.	3.506179695632561
4160. they were strays of every kind- university students and journalists	village hangers-on and barflies taxi drivers and editors and unknown	poets as well as friends like elinor wylie and william rose benet	the van dorens and nathan rebecca west and hugh walpole	and osbert sitwell laurence stallings lewis browne william seabrook	arthur hopkins the woodwards.	4.830371212019956
4161. when he came home from his	office at the end of the afternoon breasted never knew what gathering	he should expect to find but there almost always was one.	4.67938102361747
4162. he did not neglect his wife in cromwell hall but telephoned her and	wrote her with assurances of his continuing interest and of his wish	to stand behind her in their separation and of his hope that there	would be no bitterness between them.	5.052569304837941
4163. she was occupying herself in	an attempt to write an article about the variety of houses that they	had rented abroad.	4.615666810293085
4164. he was of unsettled mind as to whether he should go	abroad when the gantry galleys were finished.	6.552619285144002
4165. for a time urging	breasted to give up his public relations work and take up writing	instead he hoped to persuade him to become his assistant in research	for the labor novel; if breasted agreed they would get a car and tour	the country visiting every kind of industrial center.	3.969662501888129
4166. when breasted	insisted that this was impossible for him lewis decided to go abroad.	7.349659849808025
4167. he telephoned l m birkhead and asked him and his	wife to come to europe as his guests but birkhead declined on the	grounds that one of them must be in the united states when elmer	gantry was published.	4.563005630563073
4168. lewis was spending his mornings with the	help of two secretaries on the galleys of that long novel making considerable	revisions and the combination of hard work and hard frivolity	exhausted him once more so that he was compelled to spend three days	in the harbor sanatorium in the last week of january.	5.233281039695638
4169. before he	made that retreat he telephoned earl blackman in kansas city and	asked him to come to europe with him.	4.608424800356417
4170. blackman was to be in new york	by february 2 because they were sailing at 12:01 next morning.	6.492119315126928
4171. lewis told him what clothes he should bring along and enjoined him	not to buy anything that he did not already own they would do that	in new york.	3.994816185283038
4172. blackman arrived a day or two early and lewis took him	to a department store immediately and outfitted him luggage and all	and then he took him to a party at the woodwards that went on until	four in the morning.	4.939502993971306
4173. on the evening that they were to sail	lewis himself gave a party but he was too indisposed to appear at it.	5.253417549666155
4174. woodward took occasion to warn blackman about lewis's drinking	and urged him to try to keep him sober.	6.136819544116496
4175. after a dinner party for	which she had come down to new york mrs lewis and casanova	arrived to see them off and elinor wylie made tart observations that	indicated that lewis had been less discreet than he had promised to	be about the real nature of their separation.	3.7675966692566663
4176. nevertheless mrs	lewis was still solicitous of his condition: let him do as he wished	let him sleep with chambermaids if he must but she begged blackman	try to keep him from drinking a great deal and bring him back in	good health.	5.000769363966719
4177. as they stood at the first-class rail waving down to his	wife and casanova below lewis said earl there is gracie's	future husband.	4.293389165725567
4178. and when questioned by ship's reporters about	the separation she said i adore him and he adores me.	6.2853593354209645
4179. blackman had brought news from kansas city.	5.3285636594893
4180. before his departure	a group of his friends the reverend stidger among them had given	him a luncheon and stidger had seen advance sheets of elmer gantry.	5.241637444245614
4181. he was outraged by the book and announced that he had discovered	fifty technical errors in its account of church practices.	4.757965590832402
4182. l m	birkhead challenged him to name one and he was silent.	6.955951439843313
4183. but his rancor	did not cease and presently on march 13 when he preached a sermon	on the text and ben-hadad was drunk he told his congregation	how disappointed he was in mr lewis how he regretted having	had him in his house and how he should have been warned by the fact	that the novelist was drunk all the time that he was working on the	book.	3.98572260983114
4184. but that sermon like those of hundreds of other ministers was	yet to be delivered.	6.862181005792525
4185. in london lewis took the usual suite	in bury street.	5.110974134582851
4186. to the newspapers he talked about his unquiet life	about his wish to be a newspaperman once more about the prevalence of	american slang in british speech about the loquacity of the english	and the impossibility of finding quiet in a railway carriage about	his plans to wander for two years unless stopped and made to write	another book.	5.033723236934799
4187. the manchester guardian wondered how anyone	in a railway carriage would have an opportunity to talk to mr lewis	since it was well known that mr lewis always did all of the talking.	4.147695418485259
4188. his english friends it said had gone into training to keep	up with him vocally and with his allegro movements around the luncheon	table.	5.346487147377871
4189. the new york times editorialist wondered just who	would stop mr lewis and make him write a book.	4.4234280599246025
4190. lewis's	remarks about his marriage were suggestive enough to induce american	reporters to invade the offices of harcourt brace + company for	information to pursue mrs lewis to cromwell hall and after	she had returned to new york to ferret her out at the stanhope on	upper fifth avenue where she had taken an apartment.	4.755031163139416
4191. there to the	evening post she emphatically denied the divorce rumors and explained	that she had stayed behind because of the schooling of their son	which henceforth would be strictly american.	4.183554143263321
4192. these rumors of permanent	separation started up a whole crop of stories about her.	6.072932955837091
4193. one had	it that a friend protesting her snobbery said but gracie	you are an american aren't you?	4.34762191062725
4194.  and she replied i was born	in america but i was conceived in vienna.	7.262245722212815
4195. lewis	himself furthered these tales.	6.683325264329536
4196. he is said to have reported that once	when she went to a hospital to call on a friend after a serious operation	and the friend protested that it had been nothing she replied	well it was your healthy american peasant blood that pulled	you through.	5.48033932634402
4197. with these and similar tales he was entertaining his	english friends all of whom he was seeing when he was not showing	blackman the sights of london and its environs.	4.599872324070651
4198. at once upon	his arrival he telephoned lady sybil colefax who invited them to	tea and then lewis decided to give a party as a quick way of rounding	up his friends.	5.343883854032879
4199. he invited lady sybil lord thomson bechhofer	roberts and a half dozen others.	5.62431291813696
4200. it was a dinner party lewis had	been drinking during the afternoon and long before the party really	got under way he was quite drunk with the result that the party broke	up even before dinner was over.	5.324813017411758
4201. lewis at the head of the table would	leap up and move around behind the chairs of his guests making remarks	that when not highly offensive were at least highly inappropriate	and then presently he collapsed and was put to bed.	3.7081662258636445
4202. when	blackman emerged from the bedroom everyone was gone except the tolerant	lord thomson who stayed and chatted with him for half an hour	and then blackman lay awake most of that night despairing of what he	must expect on the continent.	4.69565759163433
4203. finally at dawn he fell asleep and	when he awoke and came into the living room he found lewis in his pajamas	before the fire smoking a cigarette.	4.09614618790318
4204. blackman said that he wanted	to apologize for not having prevented lewis from making that horrible	spectacle of himself that he should have seized him by the neck	at once and forcibly hauled him into his bedroom.	5.076089339863545
4205. lewis warned him never	to lay a hand on him and then blackman asked for his fare back	to the united states.	3.841511969386553
4206. lewis looked at him and began to cry and then	saying that he was going to make a promise he asked blackman to call	the porter and to tell him to take out all the liquor that he did	not want.	5.886623974811171
4207. and from now on for the rest of this trip i will only	drink what you agree that i should drink.	4.707334387960655
4208. blackman called the porter	and had him remove everything but one bottle of brandy and after	that they would have a cocktail or two before dinner or on one of their	walking trips beer or in france and italy wine in moderation.	5.086781070044102
4209. lewis gave him a guidebook tour of london and motoring and	walking took him to stratford but the london stay was for only ten	days and on the twentieth they took the train for southampton where	they spent the night for an early morning channel crossing.	3.796246461439901
4210. near	southampton in a considerable establishment lived homer vachell	a well-known pulp writer and his brother horace- both friends of	lewis's.	5.407067213161106
4211. he suggested that they call on these brothers who received	them pleasantly.	4.88329851797021
4212. then they returned to their hotel and got ready	for bed.	8.449785038412156
4213. it was late and blackman was ready to go to sleep but lewis	was not.	5.583803196458196
4214. he said we had a good time tonight didn't we earl?	8.511054939962097
4215. 	earl agreed and lewis said that it would have been very different	if his wife had been with him.	5.135752552768564
4216. then he kept blackman awake	for more than an hour while he did an imaginary dialogue between his wife	and himself in which discussing the evening he was continually berated.	5.2654973377031755
4217. he began the dialogue by having his wife announce that one does	not invade people's homes without warning them that one is coming	and went on from that with the entire catalogue of his social gaucheries.	3.874954087353991
4218. from 1613 on if the lists exist they contain between twenty to thirty	names.	6.399703025198675
4219. as the total number of incepting bachelors in 1629 was according	to masson two hundred fifty-nine	the twenty-four names listed in the ordo senioritatis for that	year constitute slightly less than one tenth of the total number of bachelors	who then incepted.	3.886499131088411
4220. there were four from st john's and	four from christ's three from pembroke and two from each of the	colleges jesus peterhouse queens' and trinity with caius	clare king's magdalene and sidney supplying one each in the ordo	senioritatis.	4.9636224269485325
4221. the list was headed by henry hutton of st	john's who was matriculated from st john's at easter	1625.	3.71780471901309
4222. he became a fellow of jesus in 1629 proceeded ma from	jesus in 1632 and was proctor in 1639-40.	5.645571143051672
4223. the second name was edward	kempe matriculated from queens' college at easter 1625.	4.530410915352612
4224. he proceeded ma in 1632 and bd in 1639 being made	fellow in 1632.	6.010295572574317
4225. he was ordained deacon 16 june and priest 22 december	1633.	5.301308389229969
4226. the third name was john ravencroft who was admitted	to the inner temple in november 1631.	5.531016674600635
4227. the fourth name was john	milton of christ's college followed by richard manningham	of peterhouse who matriculated 16 october 1624.	3.857661238739999
4228. venn gave his ba	as 1624 a mistake for 1629.	6.620561755940876
4229. manningham also proceeded ma	in 1632 and became a fellow of his college in that year.	4.131860641767443
4230. john	boutflower of christ's was twelfth in the list coming from perse	school under mr lovering as pensioner 20 april 1625 under mr	alsop.	5.103675880876918
4231. the fourteenth name was richard buckenham written	buckman admitted to christ's college under scott 2 july 1625.	3.7635883207428518
4232. the fifteenth name was thomas baldwin admitted to christ's	4 march 1625 under alsop.	5.289832921804139
4233. christ's college was well represented	that year in the ordo and the name highest on the list from that	college was milton's fourth in the entire university.	4.02519215720588
4234. small wonder	that milton later boasted of how well his work had been received	there since he attained a rank in the order of commencing bachelors higher	than that of any other inceptor from christ's of that year.	5.1008041578092795
4235. it is not possible to reconstruct fully the arrangements whereby	these honors lists were then made up or even how the names that they	contained assumed the order in which we find them.	4.193350676521198
4236. the process usually	began with a tutor boasting about a boy as chappell had boasted about	lightfoot to the higher officers of the college and university.	5.615889607435522
4237. then the various officers of the college might take up the case.	6.621526141825366
4238. it	would however reach the proctors and other officers in charge of the	public-school performances of the incepting bachelors and the place	that any individual obtained in the lists depended greatly on how he comported	himself in the public schools during his acts therein as he was	incepting.	5.090482735965537
4239. of course the higher officials could add or place a name	on the list wherever they wished.	4.763114160634027
4240. milton's name being fourth is neither	too high nor too low to be assigned to the arbitrary action of	vice-chancellor proctor master or other mighty hand.	5.037682432595579
4241. he evidently	earned the place assigned him.	5.937584561088178
4242. career	looking back from the spring of 1629 over the four years	of milton's undergraduate days certain phases of his college	career stand out as of permanent consequence to him and hence to us.	5.23869022615548
4243. of	course the principal factor in the whole experience was the kind of	education he received.	5.421268088329375
4244. it differed from what an undergraduate receives	today from any american college or university mainly in the certainty	of what he was forced to learn compared with the loose and widely	scattered information obtained today by most of our undergraduates.	5.257421695343723
4245. milton	was required to absorb and display an intensive and accurate knowledge	of latin grammar logic-rhetoric ethics physics or natural philosophy	metaphysics and latin greek and hebrew.	3.692532313021866
4246. he had also	sampled various special fields of learning being unable to miss some	study of divinity justinian.	6.0612077103682624
4247. above all	he had learned to write formal latin prose and verse to a remarkable	degree of artistry.	4.406010612944211
4248. he had learned to dispute devastatingly both formally	and informally in latin and according to the rules on any topic	pro or con drawn from almost any subject more especially from aristotle's	works.	5.619758405803548
4249. he could produce carefully constructed orations	set and formal speeches artfully and prayerfully made by writing and	rewriting with all the aid his tutor and others could provide and then	delivered verbatim from memory.	3.8871082265997017
4250. he had also learned to dispute extempore	remarkably well the main evidence for which of course is the presence	of his name in the honors list of 162829.	5.669889683062667
4251. he also displayed	the ability to write latin verse on almost any topic of dispute the	verses of course to be delivered from memory.	4.252787520174001
4252. then we have surviving	at least one instance of a poem prepared for another in naturam non	pati senium and perhaps also the de idea platonica.	5.496713565188327
4253. but	his greatest achievement in his own eyes and in the eyes of his colleagues	and teachers was his amazing ability to produce literary latin	pieces and he was often called on to do so.	4.5477139979347765
4254. these were his public	academic activities domi forisque in the college and in the university.	7.633138990211616
4255. and his performances attracted much attention as the frequency	of his surviving pieces in any calendar that may be set up for his	undergraduate activities testifies.	4.318896072884396
4256. his other activities are	not so easily recovered.	7.498775836491436
4257. his statements about sports and exercises of	a physical nature are suggestive but inconclusive.	4.437450999192512
4258. his later boastings	of his skill with the small sword are indicative of much time and	practice devoted to the use of that weapon.	5.926989679875185
4259. venn and others have dealt	with sports and pastimes at cambridge in milton's day with not very	specific results.	4.065890504560761
4260. milton himself uncommunicative as he is about	his lesser and nonliterary activities at least gives us some evidence	that he was a great walker under any and all conditions.	5.639703530916782
4261. his early	poems and some of his prose prolusions speak of wanderings in the city	and the neighboring country that may be extended to cambridge and its	surrounding countryside.	4.410369735751745
4262. the town itself and the reedy cam he	often visited as did all in the university.	5.451777835082632
4263. the churches the taverns	and the various other places of the town must have known his figure	well as he roved to and about them.	3.742113064800394
4264. the tiny hamlet of chesterton	to the north with the fens and marshes lying on down the ouse river	may have attracted him often as it did many other youths of the time.	4.761319455471749
4265. the gog magog hills to the southeast afforded him and all other	students a vantage point from which to view the town and university	of their dwelling.	3.7015430733703973
4266. the country about cambridge is flat and not particularly	spectacular in its scenery though it offers easy going to the	foot traveler.	5.150835275134894
4267. ball games especially football required some attention	and other organized sports may have attracted him as participant	or spectator.	3.996502389132312
4268. he smoked as did everybody and imbibed the various alcoholic	beverages of that day although his protestations while at cambridge	and after that he was no drunkard point to reasonable abstinence	from the wild drinking bouts of some of the undergraduates and we	must add of some of their elders including many of the regents or teachers.	5.376152885211174
4269. what manner of person does milton appear to have been	when as an undergraduate he resided at christ's college?	4.225263716808938
4270.  he was	then a slightly built young man of pleasing appearance medium stature	and handsome face.	5.811796091316399
4271. graceful as his fencing and dancing lessons had	taught him to be in addition to the natural grace of his slight wiry	frame he cut enough of a figure to have evoked a nickname in the college	to which he himself referred in prolusion 6: a quibusdam	audivi nuper domina.	3.8819259460890656
4272. that is if we can trust that most specious	of prolusions packed as it is with wit and persiflage.	6.743843673745461
4273. the domina	sounds real enough if we could only trust the conditions under	which we learn of its use; but anyone who would put much trust in any	phase of prolusion 6 except its illusive allusiveness deserves	whatever fate may be meted out to him by virtue of the egregiously	stilted banter.	3.3599196936371682
4274. in short the traditional epithet for milton of 'lady	of christ's' while eminently fitting rests only on this	baffling passage in the midst of the most treacherous piece of writing	milton left us.	5.7634153419525775
4275. aubrey's mention of it	comes from this prolusion through christopher	milton or edward phillips.	4.411891185517149
4276. it is not a question of truth or falsity;	the prolusion in which the autobiographic statement about the	epithet occurs is such a mass of intentionally buried allusions that	almost nothing in it can be accepted as true- or discarded as false.	5.67914905017274
4277. the entire exercise latin and english is most suggestive of the	kind of person milton had become at christ's during his undergraduate	career; the mere fact that he was selected though as a substitute	to act as interlocutor or moderator for it or perhaps we should say	with buck as 'father of the act' is in itself a difficult phase	of his development to grasp.	3.481928888606162
4278. milton was to act as the archfool the	supreme wit the lightly bantering pater pater liber who could	at once trip lightly over that which deserved such treatment or could	at will annihilate the common enemies of the college gathering and	with words alone.	4.829292425879523
4279. from an exercise involving merely raucous rough-and-tumble	comedy in his hands the performance turned into a revel of	wit and word play indecent at times but always learned pointed and	carefully aimed at some individuals present and at the whole assembly.	3.7993388570311883
4280. to do this successfully required great skill and a special talent	for both solemn and ribald raillery a talent not bestowed on many persons	but one with which milton was marked as being endowed and in which	at least in this performance he obviously reveled.	4.845208424452267
4281. it may be thought	unfortunate that he was called on entirely by accident to perform	if again we may trust the opening of the oratio for it marks	the beginning for us of his use of his peculiar form of witty word play	that even in this latin banter has in it the unmistakable element of	viciousness and an almost sadistic delight in verbally tormenting an	adversary.	3.784614660291554
4282. but the real beginnings of this development in him go back	to the opposing of grammar school and probably if it had not been this	occasion and these latin lines it would have been some others such	as the first prolusion that set off this streak in him of unbridled	and scathing verbal attack on an enemy.	5.015217034469591
4283. all western europe would hear	and listen to him in this same vein about the middle of the century.	5.170023412568413
4284. but these prolusions that we have surviving from the christ's	college days are only one phase of his existence then.	6.211218967270058
4285. perhaps	his most important private activity was the combination of reading	discussion with a few- if we can trust his writings to diodati and	the younger gill very few- congenial companions.	3.7102843265533374
4286. lines 23-36 of lycidas	later point to a friendship with edward king who entered	christ's college 9 june 1626.	5.557590362270223
4287. no other names among the young men	in residence at the time seem to have been even suggested by milton	as those of persons with whom he in any way consorted.	4.986348073968119
4288. but that scarcely	means that he was the aloof forbidding type of student who shared	few if any activities with his fellows the banter of the surviving	prolusions providing enough evidence to deny this.	5.6642358972233335
4289. apparently he was	not a participant in the college or university theatricals which he	once attacked as utterly unworthy performances;	but even in that famous passage milton was aiming not at the	theatricals as such but at their performance by 'persons either enter'd	or presently to enter into the ministry'.	3.6144543026794156
4290. the fact that he	nowhere mentioned theatrical performances as part of the activities of	the boys later in his hypothetical academy should not be taken	too seriously as evidence that he desired them to eschew such performances.	5.727224791699259
4291. perhaps in that short piece or letter written to hartlib in	which he sketched his scheme for educating young men he merely overlooked	that phase of their exercises.	3.8576208519307746
4292. writers of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumptions	that man can master the principles of this cause-and-effect universe	and that such mastery will necessarily better the human lot.	5.076378581498351
4293. on	the other hand the bright vision of the future has been directly stated	in science fiction concerned with projecting ideal societies- science	fiction of course is related if sometimes distantly to that	utopian literature optimistic about science literature whose period	of greatest vigor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries	produced edward bellamy's looking backward and h g	wells's a modern utopia.	3.780241290435278
4294. in arthur clarke's childhood's	end though written after the present flood of dystopias	began we can see the bright vision of science fiction clearly	defined.	5.281984428739887
4295. childhood's end- apparently indebted to kurd	lasswitz's utopian romance auf zwei planeten and	also to wells's histories of the future especially the world set	free-	describes	the bloodless conquest of earth by the overlords vastly superior	creatures who come to our world in order to prepare the human race for	its next stage of development an eventual merging with the composite	mind of the universe.	3.6405979535997477
4296. arriving just in time to stop men from turning	their planet into a radioactive wasteland the overlords unite earth	into one world in which justice order and benevolence prevail and	ignorance poverty and fear have ceased to exist.	5.043506774003533
4297. under their rule	earth becomes a technological utopia.	6.332870485884485
4298. both abolition of war and new	techniques of production particularly robot factories greatly increase	the world's wealth a situation described in the following passage	which has the true utopian ring: everything was so cheap that	the necessities of life were free provided as a public service by	the community as roads water street lighting and drainage had once	been.	4.660438642592516
4299. a man could travel anywhere he pleased eat whatever he fancied-	without handing over any money.	4.51092844006979
4300. with destructive tensions and	pressures removed men have the vigor and energy to construct a new human	life- rebuilding entire cities expanding facilities for entertainment	providing unlimited opportunities for education- indeed for	the first time giving everyone the chance to employ his talents to the	fullest.	4.85438420487043
4301. mankind as a result attains previously undreamed of levels	of civilization and culture a golden age which the overlords a very	evident symbol of science have helped produce by introducing reason	and the scientific method into human activities.	3.723941750937791
4302. thus science is the	savior of mankind and in this respect childhood's end only	blueprints in greater detail the vision of the future which though not	always so directly stated	has nevertheless been present in the minds	of most science-fiction writers.	5.724550653801039
4303. considering then the optimism	which has permeated science fiction for so long what is really remarkable	is that during the last twelve years many science-fiction writers	have turned about and attacked their own cherished vision of the future	have attacked the childhood's end kind of faith that science	and technology will inevitably better the human condition.	3.5197664953853147
4304. and they	have done this on a very large scale with a veritable flood of novels	and stories which are either dystopias or narratives of adventure	with dystopian elements.	5.016965913317602
4305. because of the means of publication- science-fiction	magazines and cheap paperbacks- and because dystopian science	fiction is still appearing in quantity the full range and extent	of this phenomenon can hardly be known though one fact is evident:	the science-fiction imagination has been immensely fertile in its extrapolations.	3.702704797639633
4306. among the dystopias for example isaac asimov's the	caves of steel portrays the deadly effects on human life	of the super-city of the future; james blish's a case of conscience	describes a world hiding from its own weapons of destruction	in underground shelters; ray bradbury's fahrenheit	451 presents a book-burning society in which wall television	and hearing-aid radios enslave men's minds; walter m miller	jr's a canticle for leibowitz finds men after	the great atomic disaster stumbling back to their previous level of	civilization and another catastrophe; frederick pohl's the midas	touch predicts an economy of abundance which in order	to remain prosperous must set its robots to consuming surplus production;	clifford d simak's how-2 tells of a future	when robots have taken over leaving men nothing to do; and robert	sheckley's the status civilization describes a world	which frightened by the powers of destruction science has given it	becomes static and conformist.	4.290548998395671
4307. a more complete list would also include	bradbury's the pedestrian philip k	dick's	solar lottery wilson	tucker's the long loud silence jack vance's	to live forever	gore vidal's messiah and	bernard wolfe's limbo as well as the three perhaps most	outstanding dystopias frederik pohl and c m kornbluth's	the space merchants kurt vonnegut's player	piano works which	we will later examine in detail.	3.5753725369693243
4308. the novels and stories like pohl's	drunkard's walk with the focus on adventure and	with the dystopian elements only a dim background- in this case an	uneasy overpopulated world in which the mass of people do uninteresting	routine jobs while a carefully selected university-trained elite	runs everything- are in all likelihood as numerous as dystopias.	4.763842723307709
4309. there is of course nothing new about dystopias for they belong	to a literary tradition which including also the closely related satiric	utopias stretches from at least as far back as the eighteenth century	and swift's gulliver's travels to the twentieth century	and zamiatin's we capek's war with the newts huxley's	brave new world e m forster's the machine	stops c s lewis's that hideous strength	and orwell's nineteen eighty-four and which in science fiction	is represented	before the present deluge as early as wells's trilogy the	time machine a story of the days to come and when	the sleeper wakes and as recently as jack williamson's with	folded hands the classic story of men replaced by their	own robots.	3.4319032661583204
4310. what makes the current phenomenon unique is that so	many science-fiction writers have reversed a trend and turned to writing	works critical of the impact of science and technology on human life.	5.467257636568163
4311. since the great flood of these dystopias has appeared only in the	last twelve years it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the chief	impetus was the 1949 publication of nineteen eighty-four an assumption	which is supported by the frequent echoes of such details as	room 101 along with education by conditioning from brave new world	a book to which science-fiction writers may well have returned	with new interest after reading the more powerful orwell dystopia.	3.3967126062917914
4312. not all recent science fiction however is dystopian for the	optimistic strain is still very much alive in mission of gravity	and childhood's end as we have seen as well as in many other	recent popular novels and stories like fred hoyle's the black	cloud; and among works of dystopian science fiction not	all provide intelligent criticism and very few have much merit as literature-	but then real quality has always been scarce in science fiction.	4.88314643603221
4313. in addition there are many areas of the human situation besides	the impact of science and technology which are examined for science-fiction	dystopias often extrapolate political social economic tendencies	only indirectly related to science and technology.	4.561368358676789
4314. nevertheless	with all these qualifications and exceptions the current dystopian	phenomenon remains impressive for its criticism that science and technology	instead of bringing utopia may well enslave dehumanize and even	destroy men.	4.815391403268571
4315. how effectively these warnings can be presented is seen	in pohl and kornbluth's the space merchants vonnegut's	player piano and wyndham's re-birth.	4.126862687011944
4316. easily	the best known of these three novels is the space merchants a	good example of a science-fiction dystopia which extrapolates much more	than the impact of science on human life though its most important	warning is in this area namely as to the use to which discoveries in	the behavioral sciences may be put.	5.070603245228561
4317. the novel which is not merely dystopian	but also brilliantly satiric describes a future america where	one-sixteenth of the population the men who run advertising agencies	and big corporations control the rest of the people the submerged	fifteen-sixteenths who are the workers and consumers with the government	being no more than a clearing house for pressures.	4.168477118891367
4318. like	ours the economy of the space merchants must constantly expand in order	to survive and like ours it is based on the principle of ever	increasing everybody's work and profits in the circle of consumption.	5.648467736456437
4319. the consequences of course have been dreadful: reckless expansion	has led to overpopulation pollution of the earth and depletion	of its natural resources.	4.42070514155706
4320. for example even the most successful executive	lives in a two-room apartment while ordinary people rent space in	the stairwells of office buildings in which to sleep at night; soyaburgers	have replaced meat and wood has become so precious that it is	saved for expensive jewelry; and the atmosphere is so befouled that	no one dares walk in the open without respirators or soot plugs.	4.860322465860534
4321. while the space merchants indicates as kingsley amis has	correctly observed some of the impending consequences of the growth	of industrial and commercial power and satirizes existing habits	in the advertising profession its warning and analysis penetrate	much deeper.	3.9495623746089272
4322. what is wrong with advertising is not only that it is	an outrage an assault on people's mental privacy or that it	is a major cause for a wasteful economy of abundance or that it contains	a coercive tendency.	5.382221983372897
4323. rather what kornbluth	and pohl are really doing is warning against the dangers inherent	in perfecting a science of man and his motives.	4.1066493507666735
4324. the space	merchants like such humanist documents as joseph wood krutch's	the measure of man and c s lewis's the abolition	of man considers what may result from the scientific study	of human nature.	4.7037670262739235
4325. if man is actually the product of his environment	and if science can discover the laws of human nature and the ways in which	environment determines what people do then someone- a someone	probably standing outside traditional systems of values- can turn around	and develop completely efficient means for controlling people.	3.7249664543646537
4326. thus	we will have a society consisting of the planners or conditioners	and the controlled.	6.3950491826433336
4327. and this of course is exactly what madison avenue	has been accused of doing albeit in a primitive way with its hidden	persuaders and what the space merchants accomplish with much	greater sophistication and precision.	4.1130979222168005
4328. pohl and kornbluth's	ad men have long since thrown out appeals to reason and developed techniques	of advertising which tie in with every basic trauma and neurosis	in american life which work on the libido of consumers which	are linked to the great prime motivations of the human spirit.	5.107555215736205
4329. as the hero mitchell courtenay explains before his conversion	the job of advertising is to convince people without letting them	know that they're being convinced.	4.042864218662398
4330. and to do this requires first	of all the kind of information about people which is provided by the	scientists in industrial anthropology and consumer research who for	example tell courtenay that three days is the optimum priming period	for a closed social circuit to be triggered with a catalytic cue-phrase-	which means that an effective propaganda technique is to send	an idea into circulation and then three days later reinforce or undermine	it.	4.858327090836032
4331. and the second requirement for convincing people without	their knowledge is artistic talent to prepare the words and pictures which	persuade by using the principles which the scientists have discovered.	4.320492872536565
4332. thus the copywriter in the world of the space merchants is the	person who in earlier ages might have been a lyric poet the person capable	of putting together words that stir and move and sing.	6.350769436862289
4333. as	courtenay explains here in this profession we reach into the souls	of men and women.	4.346493329290896
4334. and we do it by taking talent- and redirecting	it.	6.942007227477309
4335. now the basic question to be asked in this situation	is what motivates the manipulators that is what are their values?	4.3567819930649
4336. -	since as courtenay says nobody should play with lives the way	we do unless he's motivated by the highest ideals.	5.33084098673499
4337. but the only	ideal he can think of is sales! indeed again and again the	space merchants confirm the prediction of the humanists that the conditioners	and behavioral scientists once they have seen through human	nature will have nothing except their impulses and desires to guide	them.	3.7222264393763327
4338. we often say of a person that he looks young for his age	or old for his age.	5.693685624831177
4339. yet even in the more extreme of such cases	we seldom go very far astray in guessing what his age actually is.	4.789852066418782
4340. and	this means i suppose that almost invariably age reveals itself by	easily recognizable signs engraved on both the body and the mind.	5.530660324020607
4341. young	for his age means only the presence of some minor characteristic	not quite usual.	4.748284589293116
4342. stigmata quite sufficient for diagnosis are nevertheless	there.	7.698226595403342
4343. an assumption of youth or the presence of a few youthful	characteristics deceives no more successfully than rouge or dyed	hair.	4.792025824184004
4344. looking young for your age means for your age and	it means no more.	6.03219744133936
4345. a mind expressing itself in words may reveal	itself a little less obviously as old or young.	4.032285002619357
4346. its surface loses its	bloom and submits to its wrinkles in ways less immediately obvious	than the body does.	5.709941797253307
4347. youth may be and often is skeptical cynical or	despairing; age may be idealistic believing and much given to professions	of optimism.	3.906369919448577
4348. but there is nevertheless always a subtle difference	in the way in which supposedly similar opinions are held.	7.092161671165487
4349. the	pessimism of the young is defiant anxious to confess or even exaggerate	its ostensible gloom and so exuberant as to reveal the fact that	it regards	its ability to face up to the awful truth as more than enough to compensate	for the awfulness of that truth.	3.608304310689359
4350. similarly the optimism of age	protests too much.	7.907367817489904
4351. if it proclaims that the best is yet to be it always	arouses at least in the young either a suspicious question or perhaps	the exclamation of the negro youth who saw on a tombstone the	inscription i am not dead but sleeping.	4.156926458496278
4352. boy you ain't fooling	nobody but yourself.	7.603896187885215
4353. we may say of some unfortunates	that they were never young.	5.462722414021455
4354. we cannot truthfully say of anyone who has	succeeded in entering deep into his sixties that he was never old.	6.5998971337953165
4355. those famous lines of the greek anthology with which a fading beauty	dedicates her mirror at the shrine of a goddess reveal a wise attitude:	venus take my votive glass since i am not what i was what	from this day i shall be venus let me never see.	3.750445630114623
4356. no	good can come of contemplating the sad inevitable fact that once youth	has passed a worse and worse time still succeeds the former.	5.051766433984403
4357. but there are at least two reasons for contemplating one's mind	in even a cracked mirror.	5.738380810837608
4358. one is that there sometimes are real although	inadequate compensations in growing old.	8.058458096733133
4359. serenity if one is fortunate	enough to achieve it is not so good as joy but it is something.	5.5920255288215435
4360. even to be from hope and fear set free is at least better than	to have lost the first without having got rid of the second.	5.646392169607988
4361. the other	reason is that one thus	becomes inclined to inquire of any opinion or change of opinion	whether it represents the wisdom of experience or is only the result of	the difference between youth and age which is as inevitable as the all	too obvious physical differences.	3.368822163107641
4362. one may be exasperatingly aware	that if the answer is favorable it will be judged such only by those of	one's own age.	6.583425825678091
4363. but at least the question has been raised.	7.275232837436123
4364. many readers	of this department no doubt discount certain of my opinions for	the simple reason that they can guess pretty accurately even if they	have never actually been told what my age is.	5.156939712858829
4365. at least i should like	them to know that i know these discounts are being made.	5.4274230082236645
4366. let	me then glance into the mirror.	7.603896187885215
4367. i have known some	men and women who said that the selves they are told about or even remember	seem utter strangers to them now; that their remote past is as	discontinuous with their present selves as lacking in any conscious	likeness to their mature personality as the self of a butterfly may be	imagined discontinuous with that of the caterpillar it once was.	3.706320268475991
4368. for	my part i find it difficult to conceive such a state of affairs.	6.9233700129652105
4369. i	have changed and i have reversed opinions; but i am so aware of an	uninterrupted continuity of the persona or ego that i see only as absurd	the tendency of some psychologists from heraclitus to pirandello	and proust to regard consciousness as no more than a flux amid which	nothing remains unchanged.	3.8573683215642296
4370. so far as i am concerned the child is	unmistakably father to the man despite the obvious fact that child and	father differ greatly- sometimes for the better and sometimes for	the worse.	6.0972160438549485
4371. fundamental values temperament and the way in which	one approaches a conviction change less of course than specific opinions.	4.509305662834427
4372. that fact is very clearly illustrated in the case of the many	present-day intellectuals who were communists or near-communists in	their youth and are now so extremely conservative	that they can define no important political conviction	that does not seem so far from even a centrist position as to make	the distinction between mr nixon and mr khrushchev for them	hardly worth noting.	5.080756431491404
4373. but in ways more fundamental than specific political	opinions they are still what they always were: passionate sure	without a shadow of doubt of whatever it is that they are sure of capable	of seeing black and white only and therefore committed to the	logical extreme of whatever it is they are temporarily committed to.	4.01726692848902
4374. to those of my readers who find many of my opinions morally or	politically or sociologically antiquated	i would like to say what i have already	hinted namely that some of my opinions may indeed be subject to some	discount on the simple ground that i am no longer young and therefore	incapable of being youthful of mind.	5.204225286149406
4375. but i will also remind them that	i have always been inclined to skepticism to a kind of laodicean	lack of commitment so far as public affairs are concerned; so that	although not as eager as i once was to be disapproved of i can still	resist prevailing opinions.	4.2006646436659345
4376. at about the age of twelve i became	a spencerian liberal and i have always considered myself a liberal	of some kind even though the definition has changed repeatedly since	spencer became a reactionary.	6.056906476884906
4377. several times in my youth i voted	the socialist ticket but less because i was socialist than because	i was not either a republican or a democrat and i voted for	franklin roosevelt every time he was a candidate.	3.8742297548615223
4378. yet during the years	when i was on the staff of the nation i tried to the limit	the patience of the editors on almost every occasion when i was permitted	to write an editorial having a bearing on a political or social	question.	5.792150122110193
4379. never once during the trying thirties did i come so	close to succumbing to the private climate of opinion as to grant russian	communism even that most weasel-worded of encomiums an interesting	experiment.	3.8204878803491162
4380. there are few things of which i am prouder than	of that unblemished record.	7.169508099566069
4381. many of my friends at the time thought that	i had received a well-deserved condemnation when lincoln steffens	denounced me in a review of one of my books as a perfect example of	the obsolete man who could understand and sympathize only with the dead	past.	4.4244167239325085
4382. but he as i can now retort was the man who could see so	short a distance ahead that after a visit to russia he gave voice to	the famous exclamation: i have seen the future and it works.	5.847347315094514
4383. the favorite excuse of those who have now recanted their approval	of communism is that they did not know how things would develop.	5.188185120250273
4384. with	this excuse i have never been much impressed.	8.385792349771222
4385. there was it seems	to me enough in the openly declared principles and intentions of russian	leaders to alienate honorable men without their having to wait	to see how it would turn out.	3.9001980051826144
4386. once many years ago i sat at dinner	next to arthur train and the subject of the nation came	up.	7.069392697060398
4387. he asked me suddenly what are your political opinions?	5.601944574788593
4388. 	well i replied some of my colleagues on the paper regard	me as a rank reactionary.	5.681722923422507
4389. after a moment's thought he replied	that still leaves you a lot of latitude.	5.683681431438152
4390. and i suppose it	did.	11.751101869414928
4391. i never have been and am not now any kind of utopian.	5.755541167851472
4392. when	i first came across samuel johnson's pronouncement the remedy	for the ills of life is palliative rather than radical it seemed	to me to sum up the profoundest of political and social truths.	5.062944377303815
4393. it	will probably explain more of my attitudes toward society than any	other phrase or principle could.	4.250812993991409
4394. why did i choose to fill these	pages in this particular issue with this mixture of rather tenuous	reflections and autobiography?	6.031568574393019
4395.  the reason is i think my awareness	that my remarks last quarter on pacifism may well have served to confirm	the opinion of some that my tendency to skepticism and dissent gets	us nowhere and that i am simply too old to hope.	3.528779107991247
4396. i would however	like to suggest that wrong though i may be the tendency to see	dilemmas rather than solutions is one of which i have been a victim ever	since i can remember and therefore not merely a senile phenomenon.	6.518270973352095
4397. i know that one must act.	8.2567845507107
4398. but one need not always be sure that the	action is either wise or conclusive.	7.159919317479983
4399. apropos of what some would	call cynicism i remember an anecdote the source of which i forget.	4.636802240769381
4400. it concerns a small-town minister who staged an impressive object	lesson by confining a lion and a lamb together in the same cage outside	his church door.	5.742964846517723
4401. not only his parishioners but the whole town and	ultimately the whole county were enormously impressed by this object	lesson.	4.6592981864210214
4402. one day he was visited by a delegation of would-be imitators	who wanted to know his secret.	6.216617363098825
4403. how on earth do you manage it?	6.230223144455525
4404. 	what is the trick?	8.978076491592427
4405.  why he replied it is perfectly simple;	there is no trick involved.	5.133576455386665
4406. all you have to do is put in a fresh	lamb from time to time.	8.411768682125023
4407. cynical?	11.00104558771429
4408.  blasphemous?	14.778306436938408
4409.  not really	it seems to me.	7.434897436843941
4410. the promise that the lion and the lamb will lie down	together was given in the future tense.	6.0803919459024485
4411. it is not something that can	be expected to happen now.	5.673629021507076
4412. without really changing the general	subject i take this opportunity to confess that i am troubled by	doubts not only about pacifism but also when asked to join in the protest	against a law that most of those who consider themselves humane	and liberal seem to regard as obviously barbarous; namely the law	that prescribes the death penalty for murder when there seem to be no	extenuating circumstances.	5.043625821426653
4413. it is not that i am unaware of the force	of their strongest contention.	5.549800564952383
4414. life they say should be regarded as	sacred and therefore as something that neither an individual nor his	society has a right to take away.	5.643631557414425
4415. in fact i cannot imagine myself	condemning a man to the noose or the electric chair if i had to take	as an individual the responsibility for his death.	4.442838741062413
4416. just as i know	i would make a bad soldier even though i cannot sincerely call myself	a pacifist so too i would not be either a hangman by profession or	if i could avoid it even a member of a hanging jury.	5.515757980562179
4417. despite these	facts the question should no murderer ever be executed?	5.275495863892592
4418.  seems	to me to create a dilemma not to be satisfactorily disposed of by a	simple negative answer.	6.585920462824375
4419. punishment of the wrongdoer so liberals	are inclined to say can have only three possible justifications:	revenge reformation or deterrent example.	3.8880356915934375
4420. for here if anywhere in contemporary literature is a major effort to	counterbalance existentialism and restore some of its former lustre to	the tarnished image of the species man or as malraux himself puts	it to make men conscious of the grandeur they ignore in themselves.	5.0259979217424835
4421. andre malraux's the walnut trees of altenburg	was written in the early years of the second world war during	a period of enforced leisure when he was taken prisoner by the germans	after the fall of france.	4.85846919052932
4422. the manuscript presumably after being	smuggled out of the country was published in switzerland in 1943.	6.727864355604274
4423. the work as it stands is not the entire book that malraux wrote at that	time- it is only the first section of a three-part novel called	la lutte avec l'ange; and this first section was somehow preserved	when the gestapo destroyed the rest.	3.728726390275355
4424. if we are to believe the list of titles printed in malraux's latest	book la metamorphose des dieux vol 1 he is	still	engaged in writing a large novel under his original title.	5.809770121343572
4425. but as he	remarks in his preface to the walnut trees a novel can hardly	ever be rewritten and when this one appears in its final form	the form of the first part h will no doubt be radically changed.	4.027394309114736
4426. malraux pretends perhaps with a trifle too self-conscious a modesty	that his fragmentary work will accordingly appeal only to the	curiosity of bibliophiles	and to connoisseurs of what might have	been.	4.847755985425517
4427. even in its present form however the first part of malraux's	unrecoverable novel is among the greatest works of mid-twentieth	century literature; and it should be far better known than it is.	4.335084503451805
4428. the theme of the walnut trees of altenburg is most closely	related to its immediate predecessor in malraux's array of novels:	man's hope.	4.9588489525022235
4429. this magnificent but greatly underestimated	book which bodies forth the very form and pressure of its time	as no other comparable creation has suffered severely from having	been written about an historical event- the spanish civil war-	that is still capable of fanning the smoldering fires of old political	feuds.	3.359145195096519
4430. even so apparently impartial a critic as w h frohock	has taken for granted that the book was originally intended as a piece	of loyalist propaganda; and has then gone on to argue with unimpeachable	consistency that all the obviously non-propagandistic aspects	of the book are simply inadvertent contradictions.	4.9258213129035395
4431. nothing	however could be farther from the truth.	5.3285636594893
4432. the whole purpose of	man's hope is to portray the tragic dialectic between means and	ends inherent in all organized political violence- and even when such	violence is a necessary and legitimate self-defense of liberty justice	and human dignity.	4.736042176689491
4433. nowhere before in malraux's pages have we	met such impassioned defenders of a quality of man which transcends	the realm of politics and even the realm of action altogether-	both the action of malraux's early anarchist-adventurers like perken	and garine and the self-sacrificing action of dedicated communists	like kyo gisors and katow in man's fate.	3.5878017188264133
4434. man engages	only a small part of himself in an action says old alvear the art-historian;	and the more the action claims to be total the smaller	is the part of man engaged.	5.473601582539634
4435. these lines never cease to haunt	the book amidst all the exaltations of combat and to make an appeal for	a larger and more elemental human community than one based on the brutal	necessities of war.	4.195176688785521
4436. it is this larger theme of the quality	of man a quality that transcends the ideological and flows into	the human which now forms the pulsating heart of malraux's	artistic universe.	5.216834274839687
4437. malraux to be sure does not abandon the world	of violence combat and sudden death which has become his hallmark as	a creative artist and which is the only world apparently in which	his imagination can flame into life.	4.130371664827782
4438. the walnut trees of altenburg	includes not one war but two and throws in a turkish revolution	along with some guerrilla fighting in the desert for good measure.	4.732872541819942
4439. but	while war still serves as a catalyst for the values that malraux wishes	to express these values are no longer linked with the triumph or	defeat of any cause- whether that of an individual assertion of the	will-to-power or a collective attempt to escape from the humiliation	of oppression- as their necessary condition.	3.5245284270688892
4440. on the contrary the	frenzy and furor of combat is only the sombre foil against which the	sudden illuminations of the human flash forth with the piercing radiance	of a caravaggio.	5.6262476658444776
4441. the walnut trees of altenburg	is composed in the form of a triptych with the two small side panels	framing and enclosing the main central episode of the novel.	3.939848499143848
4442. this	central episode consists of a series of staccato scenes set in the period	from the beginning of the present century up to the first world war.	7.886390572310304
4443. the framing scenes on the other hand both take place in the late	spring of 1940 just at the moment of the defeat of france in the	second great world conflict.	4.539328597140027
4444. the narrator is an alsatian serving with	the french army and he has the same name that malraux	himself was later to use in the resistance; like malraux he was also	serving in the tank corps before being captured and we learn as well	that in civilian life he had been a writer.	4.962807283577738
4445. these biographical analogies	are obvious and far too much time has been spent speculating	on their possible implications.	4.263828217282612
4446. much more important is to grasp	the feelings of the narrator as he	becomes aware of the disorganized and bewildered mass of french prisoners	clustered together in a temporary prison camp in and around the cathedral	of chartres.	5.4636415628142565
4447. for as his companions gradually dissolve back	into a state of primitive confrontation with elemental necessity as they	lose all the appanage of their acquired culture he is overcome by	the feeling that he is at last being confronted with the essence of mankind.	3.9095831042966833
4448. as a writer by what have i been obsessed these last ten	years if not by mankind?	6.063496776248404
4449.  here i am face to face with the primeval	stuff.	6.654718129249153
4450. the intuition about mankind conveyed in these opening	pages is of crucial importance for understanding the remainder of	the text; and we must attend to it more closely than has usually been	done.	4.599521622031595
4451. what does the narrator see and what does he feel?	6.192995786908197
4452.  a good many	pages of the first section are taken up with an account of the dogged	determination of the prisoners to write to their wives and families-	even when it becomes clear that the germans are simply allowing	the letters to blow away in the wind.	5.103690579875668
4453. awkwardly and laboriously in stiff	unemotional phrases the soldiers continue to bridge the distance	between themselves and those they love; they instinctively struggle	to keep open a road to the future in their hearts.	3.716808206532985
4454. and by a skillful	and unobtrusive use of imagery	stockade the hastily erected lean-to is a babylonian hovel	the men begin to look like peruvian mummies and to acquire	malraux projects a fresco of human endurance-	which is also the endurance of the human- stretching backward into	the dark abyss of time.	4.785957152171642
4455. the narrator feels himself catching a glimpse	of pre-history learning of man's age-old familiarity with misfortune	as well as his equally age-old ingenuity his secret	faith in endurance however crammed with catastrophes the same faith	perhaps as the cave-men used to have in the face of famine.	3.4897711551323125
4456. this new vision of man that the narrator acquires is also accompanied	by a re-vision of his previous view.	5.769242177906734
4457. i thought i knew more than	my education had taught me notes the narrator because i had encountered	the militant mobs of a political or religious faith.	3.9457243968231035
4458. is	this not malraux himself alluding to his own earlier infatuation with	the ideological?	6.485001363708201
4459.  but now he knows that an intellectual is not only	a man to whom books are necessary he is any man whose reasoning	however elementary it may be affects and directs his life.	4.189728390228844
4460. from this	point of view the militant mobs of the past stirred into action	by one ideology or another were all composed of intellectuals-	and this is not the level on which the essence of mankind can be	discovered.	6.067446162767048
4461. the men around him observes the narrator have been	living from day to day for thousands of years.	4.166000982247048
4462. the human is deeper	than a mass ideology certainly deeper than the isolated individual;	and the narrator recalls the words of his father vincent berger:	it is not by any amount of scratching at the individual that one	finally comes down to mankind.	4.728045907909639
4463. the entire middle section	of the walnut trees is taken up with the life of vincent berger	himself whose fragmentary notes on his encounters with mankind	are now conveyed by his son.	3.9659074361173667
4464. he was not much older than myself	writes the narrator when he began to feel the impact of that human	mystery which now obsesses me and which makes me begin perhaps	to understand him.	5.596371496070282
4465. for the figure of vincent berger malraux has	obviously drawn on his studies of t e lawrence	and like	both lawrence and malraux himself he is a fervent admirer of nietzsche.	4.279019514523517
4466. a professor at the university of constantinople where his first	course of lectures was on nietzsche and the philosophy of action	vincent berger becomes head of the propaganda department of the	german embassy in turkey.	5.5896421502632485
4467. as an alsatian before the first world	war he was of course of german nationality; but he quickly involves	himself in the young turk revolutionary movement to such an extent	that his own country begins to doubt his patriotism.	4.016530367210761
4468. and after becoming	the right-hand man of enver pasha he is sent by the latter	to pave the way for a new turkish empire embracing the union of all	turks throughout central asia from adrianople to the chinese oases	on the silk trade route.	5.20529137070589
4469. vincent berger's mission	is a failure because the ottoman nationalism on which enver pasha	counted does not exist.	4.185616265706368
4470. central asia is sunk in a somnolence from which	nothing can awaken it; and amid a dusty desolation in which nothing	human any longer seemed to survive vincent berger begins to dream	of the occident.	4.79427142591466
4471. oh for the green of europe! trains whistling	in the night the rattle and clatter of cabs h.	4.247102990393346
4472. finally after	almost being beaten to death by a madman- he could not fight back	because madmen are sacred to islam- he throws up his mission and	returns to europe.	5.305232428792027
4473. this has been his first encounter with mankind and	although he has now become a legendary figure in the popular european	press it leaves him profoundly dissatisfied.	4.025519057483102
4474. despite berger's	report enver pasha refuses to surrender his dream of a turkish blood	alliance; and vincent berger learns that political ambition	is more apt to hide than to reveal the truth about men.	5.029210513045547
4475. but as he discovers	shortly on returning among intellectuals obsessed by le culte	du moi his experience of action had also taught him a more positive	lesson.	4.264853535974276
4476. for six years my father had had to do too much commanding	and convincing writes the narrator not to understand that man	begins with 'the other'.	5.741300870591485
4477. and when vincent berger returns	to europe this first result of his encounters with mankind is	considerably enriched and deepened by a crucial revelation.	4.270059353832476
4478. for a dawning	sense of illumination occurs in consequence of two events which	as so often in malraux suddenly confront a character with the existential	question of the nature and value of human life.	5.361760079609313
4479. one such event	is the landing in europe itself when the mingled familiarity and strangeness	of the occident after the blank immensities of asia shocks	the returning traveller into a realization of the infinite possibilities	of human life.	3.8431944239536038
4480. in a pessimistic assessment of the cold war eden declared: there	must be much closer unity within the west before there can be effective	negotiation with the east.	5.87809656958122
4481. ordinary methods of diplomacy within	the free world are inadequate said the former prime minister.	4.472887352848828
4482. something much more thorough is required.	8.543163429346873
4483. citing the experience	of the combined chiefs of staff in world war 2 eden said	that all would have been confusion and disarray without them.	4.42690949477997
4484. this	he said is exactly what has been happening between the politically	free nations in the postwar world.	5.900415644175706
4485. we need joint chiefs of a political	general staff.	6.191679425014672
4486. citing the advances of communist power in	recent years sir anthony observed: this very grave state of	affairs will continue until the free nations accept together the reality	of the danger that confronts them and unite their policies and resources	to meet it.	4.605631188606266
4487. while i fully agree with sir anthony's	contention i think that we must carry the analysis farther bearing	in mind that while common peril may be the measure of our need	the existence or absence of a positive sense of community must be the	measure of our capacity.	3.9839419439749775
4488. while it is hazardous to project	the trend of history it seems clear that a genuine community is painfully	emerging in the western world particularly among the countries	of western europe.	5.817300103172263
4489. at the end of world war 2 free europe was	ready for a new beginning.	6.75735399143466
4490. the excesses of nationalism had brought	down upon europe a generation of tyranny and war and a return to the	old order of things seemed unthinkable.	4.795531641785159
4491. under these conditions a new	generation of europeans began to discover the bonds of long association	and shared values that for so long had been subordinated to nationalist	xenophobia.	3.9398223629379574
4492. a slow and painful trend toward unification has taken	hold a trend which may at any time be arrested and reversed but which	may also lead to a binding federation of europe.	5.036746701023358
4493. it may well be	that the unification of europe will prove inadequate that the survival	of free society will require nothing less than the confederation of	the entire western world.	4.289198339225906
4494. the movement toward european unity	has been expressed in two currents: federalism and functionalism	one looking to the constitution of a united states of europe the	other building on wartime precedents of practical coo^peration for the	solution of specific problems.	4.83639533852877
4495. thus far the advances made have been	almost entirely along functional lines.	5.00729073895379
4496. many factors contributed	to the growth of the european movement.	9.24552908235005
4497. in 1946 sir winston churchill	who had spoken often of european union during the war advocated	the formation of a kind of united states of europe.	4.70454801858179
4498. had	churchill been returned to office in 1945 it is just possible that	britain instead of standing fearfully aloof would have led europe	toward union.	5.3645674963869014
4499. in 1947 and 1948 the necessity of massive	coo^rdinated efforts to achieve economic recovery led to the formation	of the organization for european economic coo^peration to supervise	and coo^rdinate the uses of american aid under the marshall	plan.	3.9343244732714675
4500. the united states might well have exploited the opportunity	provided by the european recovery program to push the hesitant european	nations toward political federation as well as economic coo^peration	but all proposals to this effect were rejected by the united	states government at the time.	5.206817420134392
4501. another powerful factor in	the european movement was the threat of soviet aggression.	4.99966679011312
4502. the communist	coup in czechoslovakia in 1948 was followed immediately by the	conclusion of the brussels treaty a 50-year alliance among britain	france and the benelux countries.	4.698723859097317
4503. and of course the soviet threat	was responsible for nato the grand alliance of the atlantic	nations.	4.985943268332644
4504. new organs of unification proliferated in the decade	following the conclusion of the nato alliance.	6.747041588719886
4505. in 1949 the council	of europe came into existence a purely consultative parliamentary	body but the first organ of political rather than functional unity.	4.045872844954621
4506. in 1952 the european coal and steel community was launched	placing the coal and steel production of france west germany italy	and benelux under a supranational high authority.	5.08990459393125
4507. for a time it	appeared that a common european army might be created but the project	for a european defense community was rejected by the french national	assembly in 1954.	4.149698683533787
4508. in 1957 the social-economic approach to european	integration was capped by the formation among the six of	a tariff-free european common market and euratom for coo^peration	in the development of atomic energy.	5.391392378075507
4509. the overseas democracies	have generally encouraged the european unification movement	without seriously considering the wisdom of their own full participation	in a broader atlantic community.	3.966871661886913
4510. the united states and canada	belong only to nato and the new oecd.	7.766210365789379
4511. britain	until recently went along in some areas with all of the enthusiasm of	the groom at a shotgun wedding.	4.6599003613193934
4512. in other areas it held back pleading	its commonwealth bonds.	8.386173943861621
4513. now britain has decided to seek admission	to the european economic community and it seems certain that she will	be joined by some of her partners in the loose free trade area	of the outer seven.	3.7938523753113116
4514. besides its historical significance as a	break with the centuries-old tradition of british insularity britain's	move if successful will constitute an historic landmark of the	first importance in the movement toward the unification of europe and	the western world.	4.798885834184701
4515. if a broader atlantic community is to	be formed- and my own judgment is that it lies within the realm of both	our needs and our capacity- a ready nucleus of machinery is at hand	in the nato alliance.	4.100823269750302
4516. the time is now ripe indeed overdue	for the vigorous development of its non-military potentialities for	its development as an instrument of atlantic community.	5.116734037623033
4517. what is required	is the full implementation of article 2 of the treaty which	provides: the parties will contribute toward the further development	of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening	their free institutions by bringing about a better understanding of	the principles upon which these institutions are founded and by promoting	conditions of stability and well-being.	3.487135631702163
4518. they will seek to eliminate	conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage	economic collaboration between any and all of them.	6.391336212114945
4519. as lester	pearson wrote in 1955: nato cannot live on fear alone.	4.9655764246179235
4520. it	cannot become the source of a real atlantic community if it remains	organized to deal only with the military threat which first brought	it into being.	5.85525172411357
4521. the problem of nato is not one of machinery	of which there is an abundance but of the will to use it.	5.3009388852216865
4522. the	nato council is available as an executive agency the standing	group as a high military authority.	5.550554466109728
4523. the unofficial conference of	parliamentarians is available as a potential legislative authority.	4.136026223441104
4524. this machinery will not become the instrument of an atlantic community	by fiat but only when that community evolves from potentiality to	reality.	5.175024340995933
4525. the existence of a community is a state of mind- a conviction	that goals and values are widely shared that effective communication	is possible that mutual trust is reasonably assured.	3.7126023722784867
4526. an	equally promising avenue toward atlantic community may lie through the	development and expansion of the oecd conceived as	an organ of economic coo^peration there is no reason why oecd	cannot evolve into a broader instrument of union if its members	so desire.	5.334191544572229
4527. indeed it might be a more appropriate vehicle than nato	for the development of a parliamentary organ of the atlantic	nations because it could encompass all of the members of the atlantic	community including those like sweden and switzerland who	are unwilling to be associated with an essentially military alliance like	nato.	4.23141684951976
4528. underlying these hopes and prescriptions is a	conviction that the nations of the north atlantic area do indeed form	a community at least a potential community.	6.328454617060251
4529. there is nothing new	in this; what is new and compelling is that the west is now but one	of several powerful civilizations or systems and that one or	more of the others may pose a mortal danger to the west.	4.069169127794767
4530. for centuries	the north atlantic nations dominated the world and as long as they	did they could afford the luxury of fighting each other.	6.718491048490592
4531. that time	is now past and the atlantic nations if they are to survive must develop	a full-fledged community and they must also look beyond the frontiers	of western civilization toward a world-wide concert of	free nations.	3.8797267538247553
4532. the burden of these reflections is that	a broader unity among the free nations is at the core of our needs.	6.097569078481779
4533. and if we do not aspire to too much it is also within our capacity.	6.100872282430681
4534. a realistic balancing of the need for new forms of international organization	on the one hand and our capacity to achieve them on the other	must be approached through the concept of community.	6.071079624374171
4535. history	has demonstrated many times that concerts of nations based solely on	the negative spur of common danger are unlikely to survive when the external	danger ceases to be dramatically urgent.	3.6490768836246956
4536. only when a concert of	nations rests on the positive foundations of shared goals and values	is it likely to form a viable instrument of long-range policy.	5.834188532040772
4537. it follows	that the solution to the current disunity of the free nations is	only to a very limited extent a matter of devising new machinery of consultation	and coo^rdination.	4.473601223266988
4538. it is very much a matter of building	the foundations of community.	9.285228041400707
4539. it is for these reasons that proposals	for a new world order through radical overhaul of the united	nations or through some sort of world federation are utterly	fatuous.	4.290901193141924
4540. in a recent book called world peace through world law	two distinguished lawyers grenville clark and louis sohn call	for just such an overhaul of the un basing their case on	the world-wide fear of a nuclear holocaust.	5.070299334383864
4541. i believe that these proposals	however meritorious in terms of world needs go far beyond our	capacity to realize them.	5.223034528961846
4542. such proposals look to an apocalyptic act	a kind of lockian social contract on a world-wide scale.	5.929783140770936
4543. the	defect of these proposals is in their attempt to outrun history and their	assumption that because something may be desirable it is also possible.	4.1089396771581495
4544. a working concept of the organic evolution of community	must lead us in a different direction.	6.432605973982364
4545. the failures of the un	and of other international organs suggest that we have already gone beyond	what was internationally feasible.	4.150458487916669
4546. our problem therefore is to	devise processes more modest in their aspirations adjusted to the real	world of sovereign nation states and diverse and hostile communities.	5.282763305492988
4547. the history of the un demonstrates that in a pluralistic	world we must develop processes of influence and persuasion rather than	coercion.	4.461473612843014
4548. it is possible that international organization will ultimately	supplant the multi-state system but its proper function for the	immediate future is to reform and supplement that system in order to	render pluralism more compatible with an interdependent world.	5.032388431179512
4549. new machinery of coo^rdination should not be our primary objective	in	the foreseeable future- though perhaps the political general staff	of western leaders proposed by sir anthony eden would serve	a useful purpose.	3.9614811133904495
4550. generally however there is an abundance of available	machinery of coo^rdination- in nato in oecd	in the un and elsewhere.	6.906367403828646
4551. the trouble with this machinery	is that it is not used and the reason that it is not used is the absence	of a conscious sense of community among the free nations.	5.14814142758167
4552. our proper objective then is the development of a new spirit the	realization of a potential community.	7.583614986243826
4553. a concert of free nations	should take its inspiration from the traditions of the nineteenth century	concert of europe with its common values and accepted rules	of the game.	4.052717583167621
4554. constitutions of and by themselves mean little; the	history of both the league of nations and the united nations demonstrates	that.	6.702911241315352
4555. but a powerful sense of community even with little	or no machinery means a great deal.	4.908296628808972
4556. that is the lesson of the nineteenth	century.	10.35562430121188
4557. a realistic concert of free nations might	be expected to consist of an inner community of the north atlantic	nations and an outer community embracing much or all of the	non-communist world.	3.81768528977862
4558. the recent experiments in the new poetry-and-jazz movement	seen by some as part of the san francisco renaissance have	been as popular as they are notorious.	6.782570003073816
4559. it might well start a craze	like swallowing goldfish or pee wee golf wrote kenneth rexroth	in an explanatory note in the evergreen review and he may have	been right.	4.07202811564005
4560. under the general heading poetry-and-jazz widely	divergent experiments have been carried out.	7.463848649628874
4561. lawrence ferlenghetti	and bruce lippincott have concentrated on writing a new poetry	for reading with jazz that is very closely related to both the musical	forms of jazz and the vocabulary of the musician.	3.7653739342845953
4562. even musicians themselves	have taken to writing poetry.	8.40572486455648
4563. but the best known exploiters	of the new medium are kenneth rexroth and kenneth patchen.	4.709212784299525
4564. rexroth	and patchen are far apart musically and poetically in their experiments.	6.093123995732186
4565. rexroth is a longtime jazz buff a name-dropper of jazz heroes	and a student of traditional as well as modern jazz.	4.323446529832513
4566. in san francisco	he has worked with brew moore charlie mingus and other	swinging musicians of secure reputation thus placing himself within	established jazz traditions in addition to being a part of the	san francisco school.	5.759208973985991
4567. although patchen has given previous	evidence of an interest in jazz the musical group that he works	with the chamber jazz sextet is often ignored by jazz critics.	4.046823558239841
4568. did not mention the los angeles appearance of patchen	the	stated goal of the cjs is the synthesis of jazz and serious	music.	5.661757095848672
4569. patchen's musicians are outsiders in established jazz circles	and patchen himself has remained outside the san francisco poetry	group maintaining a self-imposed isolation even though his conversion	to poetry-and-jazz is not as extreme or as sudden as it may first	appear.	3.7343911163297148
4570. he had read his poetry with musicians as early as 1951 and	his entire career has been characterized by radical experiments with	the form and presentation of his poetry.	5.384343335823664
4571. however his subject matter	and basic themes have remained surprisingly consistent and these together	with certain key poetic images may be traced through all his	work including the new jazz experiments.	3.758493106875453
4572. from the beginning of	his career patchen has adopted an anti-intellectual approach to poetry.	6.643206853962667
4573. his first book before the brave is a collection	of poems that are almost all communistic but after publication of this	book he rejected	communism and advocated a pacifistic anarchy though	retaining his revolutionary idiom.	3.6232175959433786
4574. he spoke for a proletariat	that included all the lost and sick and hunted of the earth.	5.820934102532555
4575. patchen	believes that the world is being destroyed by power-hungry and	money-hungry people.	5.307002585342465
4576. running counter to the destroying forces in the	world are all the virtues that are innate in man the capacity for love	and brotherhood the ability to appreciate beauty.	5.47078293802267
4577. beauty as well	as love is redemptive and patchen preaches a kind of moral salvation.	4.782911794403428
4578. this salvation does not take the form of a christian heaven.	8.033980760803205
4579. in	patchen's eyes organized churches are as odious as organized governments	and christian symbols having been taken over by the moneyed	classes are now agents of corruption.	3.7676767886579254
4580. patchen envisions a dark kingdom	which stands above the waters as a sentinel warning man of danger	from his own kind.	5.345114980985559
4581. the dark kingdom sends angels of death	and other fateful messengers down to us with stern tenderness.	3.855659496160994
4582. actually	heaven and the dark kingdom overlap; they form two aspects of	heavenly life after death.	5.659455227543579
4583. patchen has almost never used strict	poetic forms; he has experimented instead with personal myth-making.	4.21292691591616
4584. much of his earlier work was conceived in terms of a pseudo-anthropological	myth reference which is concerned with imaginary places	and beings described in grandiloquent and travelogue-like language.	5.925585805360455
4585. these early experiments were evidently not altogether satisfying	to patchen.	5.17561394638704
4586. beginning in cloth of the tempest he experimented	in merging poetry and visual art using drawings to carry long	narrative segments of a story as in sleepers awake and constructing	elaborate poems-in-drawing-and-type in which it is impossible	to distinguish between	the art and the poetry.	4.9797785319343175
4587. art makings	or pseudo-anthropological myths did not meet all of patchen's requirements	for a poetic frame of reference.	4.096172984253596
4588. many of his poems purported	to be exactly contemporary and political; so during the period approximately	from 1941 to 1946 patchen often used private detective stories	as a myth reference and the private eye as a myth hero.	5.089228133003709
4589. speaking	in terms of sociological stereotype the private eye might	appeal to the poet in search of a myth for many reasons.	4.09920184485607
4590. the private	detective	is an individual hero fighting injustice.	6.235817153065196
4591. he is usually	something of an underdog he must battle the organized police force as	well as recognized criminals.	4.423462769211276
4592. the private detective must rely as the	youngest son or trickster hero does in primitive myth on his wits.	5.112326897732939
4593. the private detective is militant against injustice a humorous	and ironic explorer of the underworld; most important to patchen he	was a non-literary hero and very contemporary.	3.567686252644706
4594. in 1945 probably almost	every american not only knew who sam spade was but had some	kind of emotional feeling about him.	5.463429939739515
4595. in the memoirs of a shy pornographer	patchen exploited this national sentiment by making	his hero albert budd a private detective.	4.087905133853617
4596. but since 1945	sam spade has undergone a metamorphosis; he has become friday	on dragnet a mouthpiece of arbitrary police authority.	5.637623106871368
4597. he has	like so many other secular and religious culture symbols gone over to	the side of the ruling classes.	4.727573138788797
4598. obviously the private eye can	have no more appeal for patchen.	7.427789776842133
4599. to fill the job of contemporary hero	in 1955 patchen needed someone else.	5.740181071190852
4600. it was logical that	he would come up with the figure of the modern jazz musician.	8.174972099112507
4601. the revolution	in jazz that took place around 1949 the evolution from the bebop	school of dizzy gillespie to the cool sound of miles	davis and lennie tristano lee konitz and the whole legend of	charlie parker had made an impression on many academic and literary	men.	3.3477758134924382
4602. the differentiation between the east coast and west coast schools	of jazz the differences between the hard bop school of rollins	and the cerebral experiments of tristano konitz and	marsh the general differences in the mores of white and negro musicians	all had become fairly well known to certain segments of the public.	4.428996946638742
4603. the immense amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger	generation must have impressed him and he began working toward the	merger of jazz and poetry as he had previously attempted the union	of graphic art and poetry.	3.658936622332751
4604. in addition to his experiments in reading	poetry to jazz patchen is beginning to use the figure of the modern	jazz musician as a myth hero in the same way he used the figure of the	private detective a decade ago.	6.064494280325984
4605. in this respect his approach to poetry-and-jazz	is in marked contrast to kenneth rexroth's.	5.175550776746473
4606. rexroth	uses many of his early poems when he reads to jazz including many of	his chinese and japanese translations; he usually draws some kind	of comparison with the jazz tradition and the poem he is reading-	for instance he draws the parallel between a poem he reads about an oriental	courtesan waiting for the man she loves and who never comes	and the old blues chants of ma rainy and other negro singers- but	usually the comparison is specious.	4.441968451448344
4607. rexroth may sometimes achieve an	effective juxtaposition but he rarely makes any effort to capture any	jazz feeling in the text of his poems relying on his very competent	musicians to supply this feeling.	3.6449244993542695
4608. patchen does read some	of his earlier works to music but he has written an entire book of	short poems which seem to be especially suited for reading with jazz.	5.494508164563773
4609. these new poems have only a few direct references to jazz and jazz musicians	but they show changes in patchen's approach to his poetry	for he has tried to enter into and understand the emotional attitude	of the jazz musician.	3.725414491013393
4610. it is difficult to draw the line between	stereotype and the reality of the jazz musician.	7.454094504185817
4611. everyone knows that	private detectives in real life are not like sam spade and pat novak	but the real and the imaginary musician are closely linked.	4.126697229532683
4612. seen	by the public the musician is the underdog par excellence.	6.480354505772655
4613. he	is forced to play for little money and must often take another job to	live.	4.4259551004504125
4614. his approach to music is highly individualistic; the accent	is on improvisation rather than arrangements.	5.823236968562879
4615. while he is worldly the	musician often cultivates public attitudes of childlike astonishment	and naivete.	4.935134732780382
4616. the musician is non-intellectual and non-verbal; he	is far from being a literary hero yet is a creative artist.	5.549595317496369
4617. many of	these aspects will be seen as comparable to those of the ideal detective	but where the detective is active and militant the jazz musician	is passive almost a victim of society.	4.2504775080112385
4618. in order to write with authority	either about musicians or as a musician patchen would have to soft	pedal his characteristically outspoken anger and change	from a revolutionary to a victim.	5.8618375191949275
4619. he	must become one who knows all about the injustice in the world but	who declines doing anything about it.	4.730770768749781
4620. this involves a shift in	patchen's attitude and it is a first step toward writing a new jazz	poetry.	6.9717280904229035
4621. he has shown considerable ingenuity in adapting his earliest	symbols and devices to the new work and the fact that he has kept a	body of constant symbols through all of his experiments gives an unexpected	continuity to his poetry.	4.455460002216893
4622. perhaps tracing some of these more important	symbols through the body of his work will show that patchen's	new poetry is well thought out and remains within the mainstream	of his work while being suited to a new form.	5.557279979624837
4623. henry miller characterized	patchen as a man of anger and light.	6.61979292796081
4624. his revolutionary	anger is apparent in most of his early poems.	7.387412538696615
4625. the following passage	from the hangman's great hands illustrates the directness	of this anger.	4.415729305842645
4626. i was born angry.	11.86727393930625
4627. angry	that my father was being burnt alive in the mills; angry that none	of us knew anything but filth and poverty.	3.841511969386553
4628. angry because i was that	very one somebody was supposed to be fighting for.	6.7022208496693425
4629. this	angry and exasperated stance which patchen has maintained in his poetry	for almost fifteen years has been successfully modulated into a kind	of woe that is as effective as anger and still expresses his disapproval	of the modern world.	3.438777759595601
4630. in his recent book hurray for anything	one of the most important short poems- and it is the title	poem for one of the long jazz arrangements- is written for recital	with jazz.	7.713066524441422
4631. although it does not follow the metrical rules for a blues	to be sung the phrases themselves carry a blues feeling.	4.633152319786928
4632. i	went to the city and there i did weep men a-crowing likes asses	and living like sheep.	6.110759864620843
4633. oh can't hold the han' of my love!	can't hold her little white han! yes i went to the city and	there i did bitterly cry men out of touch with the earth and	with never a glance at the sky.	3.971483266807091
4634. oh can't hold the han' of my love!	can't hold her pure little han'! patchen is still	the rebel but he writes in a doleful mournful tone.	5.141471249178536
4635. neither of these	poems is an aberration; each is so typical that it represents a prominent	trend in the poet's development.	4.377796241192334
4636. patchen is repeatedly	preoccupied with death.	8.18656221502958
4637. in many of his poems death comes by train:	a strongly evocative visual image.	5.374790642509467
4638. perhaps patchen was once involved	in a train accident and this passage from first will and testament	may have been how the accident appeared to the poet when he	first saw it- if he did:   lord love us look at all the	disconnected limbs floating hereabouts like bloody feathers at that-	and all the eyes are talking and all the hair are moving and all the	tongue are in all the cheek h.	4.68131716789644
4639. let us see just how typical krim is.	6.18278572877558
4640. he is new york-born	and jewish.	10.373793691322753
4641. he spent one year at the university of north carolina	because thomas wolfe went there.	5.2457177778482755
4642. he returned to new york to work	for the new yorker to edit a western pulp to duck the war	in the owi to write publicity for paramount pictures and	commentary for a newsreel then he began his career as critic for various	magazines.	5.210730588569538
4643. now he has abandoned all that to be a writer.	6.7019618681246556
4644. i do	not want to quibble about typicality; in a certain sense one manner	of experience will be typical of any given group while another will	not.	5.454246326109387
4645. but i've got news for krim: he's not typical he's pretty special.	4.6781403550885745
4646. his may typify a certain kind of postwar new york experience	but his experience is certainly not typical of his generation's.	5.621696684402108
4647. in any case who ever thought that new york is typical of anything?	5.193151544786965
4648. 	men of krim's age aspirations and level of sophistication	were typically involved in politics before the war.	5.454336586728915
4649. they did	not duck the war but they fought in it however reluctantly;	they sweated out some kind of formal education; they read widely and	eclectically;	they did not fall into pseudo-glamorous jobs on pseudo-glamorous	magazines but they did whatever nasty thing they could get	in order to eat; they found out who they were and what they could do	then within the limits of their talent they did it.	3.4903223592204724
4650. they did not worry	about experience because experience thrust itself upon them.	7.525645806312052
4651. and they traveled out of new york.	6.512024313519178
4652. only a native new yorker could	believe that new york is now or ever was a literary center.	6.066515650061974
4653. it	is a publishing and public relations center but these very facts prevent	it from being a literary center because writers dislike provincialism	and untruth.	4.275815157076495
4654. krim's typicality consists only in his new yorker's	view that new york is the world; he displays what outlanders	call the new york mind a state that the subject is necessarily unable	to perceive in himself.	5.257486248846697
4655. the new york mind is two parts abstraction	and one part misinformation about the rest of the country and in fact	the world.	5.240280512807187
4656. in his fulminating against the literary world krim is	really struggling with the new yorker in himself but it's a losing	battle.	6.175845505209817
4657. closely related to his illusions about his typicality	is krim's complicated feeling about his jewishness.	4.337820935292245
4658. he writes	most of my friends and i were jewish; we were also literary;	the combination of the jewish intellectual tradition and the sensibility	needed to be a writer created in my circle the most potent and	incredible intellectual-literary ambition i have ever seen or could ever	have imagined.	5.294946529656668
4659. within themselves just as people my friends were	often tortured and unappeasably bitter about being the offspring of this	unhappily unique-ingrown-screwedup breed; their reading and thinking	gave	an extension to their normal blushes about appearing 'jewish'	in subway bus racetrack movie house any of the public places that	used to make the jew of my generation self-conscious	walking across seventh avenue without their glasses on willing to	dare the trucks as long as they didn't look like the ikey-kikey caricature	h.	3.7048697825596024
4660. at other points in his	narrative krim associates jewishness with unappeasable literary ambition	with abstraction with his personal turning aside from the good	the true and the beautiful of fiction in the manner of james t	farrell to the international the false and the inflated.	5.012038863062971
4661. krim says in short that he is a suffering jew.	6.319682659184955
4662. the only possible	answer to that is i am a suffering franco-irishman.	7.058075228778371
4663. we all love	to suffer but some of us love to suffer more than others.	4.777866624979426
4664. had krim	gone	farther from new york than chapel hill he might have discovered	that large numbers of american jews do not find his new york version	of the jews' lot remotely recognizable.	5.849572660461456
4665. more important is the	simple human point that all men suffer and that it is a kind of	anthropological-religious	pride on the part of the jew to believe that his suffering	is more poignant than mine or anyone else's.	5.1121633863011535
4666. this is not to	deny the existence of pogroms and ghettos but only to assert that these	horrors	have had an effect on the nerves of people who did not experience	them that among the various side effects is the local hysteria	of jewish writers and intellectuals who cry out from confusion which	they call oppression and pain.	5.132063329307291
4667. in their stupidity and arrogance they	believe they are called upon to remind the gentile continually of pogroms	and ghettos.	4.563539948065808
4668. some of us have imagination and sensibility too.	8.573821923059663
4669. finally there is the undeniable fact that some of the finest american	fiction is being written by jews but it is not jewish fiction;	saul bellow and bernard malamud through intellectual toughness	perception through experience in fact have obviously liberated	themselves from any sentimental krim self-indulgence they might have	been tempted to.	4.293060752596736
4670. krim's main attack is upon the aesthetic and	the publishing apparatus of american literary culture in our day.	5.368720319504203
4671. krim was able to get an advance for a novel and time and opportunity	to write at yaddo but it was no good.	4.7388735370190345
4672. i had natural sock he	says 'as a storyteller and was precociously good at description dialogue	and most of the other staples of the fiction-writer's trade	but i was bugged by a mammoth complex of thoughts and feelings that	prevented me from doing more than just diddling the surface of sustained	fiction-writing.	5.4119811928420525
4673. and again how can you write when you haven't	yet read 'bartleby the scrivener'?	4.8862729827159335
4674.  krim came to believe	that the novel as a form had outlived its vital meaning.	5.8396084093675595
4675. his	articulate jewish friends convinced him that education	was a must.	5.040963723255581
4676. he moved in a highly intellectual	group in greenwich village in the late forties becoming internationalized	overnight.	6.407564998798476
4677. then followed a period in which he wrote reviews	for the new york times book review the commonweal commentary	had a small piece in partisan review and moved on	to hudson the village voice and exodus.	4.01178736991491
4678. the work for	commonweal	was more satisfying than work for commentary because	of the staff's tiptoeing fear of making a booboo.	5.399648869853861
4679. commentary	was a mere suburb of partisan review the arch-enemy.	4.855658467968249
4680. both	magazines were rigid with reactionary what-will-t s eliot-or-martin	buber-think?	6.806723317680827
4681.  fear h.	8.815314306294878
4682. partisan has failed	krim says for being snob-clannish overcerebral europeanish aristocratically	alienated from the us.	5.7836982265615156
4683. it was the creation	of a monstrous historical period wherein it thought it had to synthesize	literature and politics and avant-garde art of every kind with	its writers crazily trying to outdo each other in spenglerian inclusiveness	h.	4.03860258557899
4684. kenyon sewanee and hudson operated in an anglo-protestant	new critical chill; their example caused krim	and his friends to put on englishy airs affect all sorts of	impressive	scholarship and social-register unnaturalness h in order to	slip through their narrow transoms and get into their pages.	4.647679679617169
4685. qui	s'excuse s'accuse as the french jewish intellectuals used	to say.	4.855658467968249
4686. through all this raving krim is performing a traditional	and by now boring rite the attack on intelligence upon the largely	successful attempt of the magazines he castigates to liberate american	writing from local color and other varieties of romantic corn.	4.733934463604801
4687. god	knows that partisan and the rest often were and remain guilty	of intellectual flatulence.	4.458680896412746
4688. sociological jargon germano-slavic	approximations to english third-rate but modish fiction and outrages	to common sense have often disfigured partisan and in lesser degree	the other magazines on the list.	4.882518002615294
4689. what krim ignores in his contempt	for history and for accuracy is that these magazines partisan	foremost brought about a genuine revolution in the american mind	from the mid-thirties to approximately 1950.	3.9761787602652743
4690. the most obvious characteristic	of contemporary american writing apart from the beat nonsense	is its cosmopolitanism.	6.444984857087146
4691. the process of cosmopolitanism	had begun in earnest about 1912 but the first war and the depression	virtually stalled that process in its tracks.	4.1721104799454025
4692. without the good magazines	without their book reviews their hospitality to european writers	without above all their awareness of literary standards we might	very well have had a generation of krim's heroes- wolfes farrells	dreisers and i might add sandburgs and frosts and macleishes	in verse- and then where would we be?	4.673591695166614
4693.  screwed stewed and tattooed	as krim might say after reading a book about sailors.	4.305414028832856
4694. when	partisan and kenyon set up shop mencken was still accepted	as an arbiter of taste george jean nathan	and alexander woollcott were honored in odd quarters and the whole	booth tarkington willa catheter pearl buck amy	lowell william lyon phelps atmosphere lay thick as los angeles	smog over the country.	4.480673517000787
4695. politics economics sociology- the	entire area of life that lies between literature and what krim calls	experience- urgently needed to be dug into.	3.7992019768996257
4696. the universities	certainly were not doing it nor were the popular magazines of the day.	5.201929906662087
4697. this partisan above all did; if it had never printed a word	of literature its contribution to the politico-sociological area would	still be historic.	4.274954061091432
4698. but it did print good verse and good fiction.	8.600196675582204
4699. if	the editors sometimes dozed and printed pretentious new york-mind	dross they also printed malraux silone chiaromonte gide bellow	robert lowell francis fergusson mary mccarthy delmore	schwartz mailer elizabeth hardwick eleanor clark and a host	of other good writers.	3.538579689689258
4700. partisan review and the other literary magazines	helped to educate in the best sense an entire generation.	6.5924389440919215
4701. that	these magazines also deluded the krims of the world is unfortunate	but inevitable.	5.895357808644
4702. it is a fact of life that magazines are edited by	groups: they have to be or they wouldn't be published at all.	6.451009313882312
4703. and	it is also a fact of life that there will always be youngish half-educated	people around who will be dazzled by the glitter of what looks like	a literary movement.	4.124934547089999
4704. only writers doing their work.	9.963352816790293
4705. literary movements are the creation of	when krim says mine was as severe a	critical-intellectual environment as can be imagined he is off his	rocker.	3.841378309058003
4706. he indicates that he has none of the disciplines that criticism	requires including education; the result was his inevitable bedazzlement	through ignorance.	6.584933515970789
4707. he wasn't being educated in those village	bull-sessions as he claims.	4.844213633027724
4708. no one was ever educated through bull-sessions	in anything other than to quote him again perfumed bullshit.	6.337472641448103
4709. only a new york hick would expect to find the literary	life in greenwich village at any point later than walt whitman's	day.	4.731286265860056
4710. the highly intellectual h minds that krim says he encountered	in the village did their work in spite of not because of any	village atmosphere.	5.309230324779659
4711. but krim's complaint is important because not	only in new york but in other cities and in universities throughout	this country young and not so young men at this moment are being	bedazzled by half-digested ideas.	4.075084642553092
4712. those who have quality will outgrow	the experience; the rest will turn beat or into dentists or into	beat dentists.	6.361059899345346
4713. for the sad truth is that while one might write	well without having read bartleby the scrivener one is more	likely to write well if one has read it and much else.	3.965532447838355
4714. the most appalling	aspect of krim's piece is his reflection of the beat aesthetic.	6.873499054419991
4715. he mentions the beats only once when he refers to their having revived	through mere power and abandonment and the unwillingness to commit	death in life some idea of a decent equivalent between verbal expression	and actual experience h but the entire narrative is written	in the tiresome vocabulary of that lost and dying cause and in the	sprung syntax that is supposed to supplant our mother tongue.	3.5220523561646147
4716. krim's	aesthetic combines anti-intellectualism conscious and unconscious	nai^vete and a winsome reliance upon the natural and upon experience.	5.548311018326483
4717. ideas are the thruway to nowhere.	5.66037853959279
4718. my touchstones	h had been strictly literature and humanly enough american	literature.	6.900166699484279
4719. he alludes	to something called direct writing and he finds that criticism	gets in the way of his truer realer imaginative bounce.	4.415632789601314
4720. there had been signs and portents like the regular toppling over and	defacing of the bust of lauro di bosis near the villa lante and in	the gianicolo.	5.64278453857777
4721. something was happening all right slowly it	is true but you could feel it.	4.7051043802924895
4722. an italian poet had noticed plainclothes policemen lounging around	the area of quirinal palace the first time since the war.	6.427381860325286
4723. at least	they hadn't stepped up and asked to see papers in the hated flat	dialect mispronunciation of mussolini's home district- dogumenti	per favore.	4.076428055729631
4724. but who knew that might be coming one of these days.	8.558467786193953
4725. there were other italians who still bore scars they had earned	in police station basements resisting.	4.704894308547772
4726. they laughed and true to national	form and manners never talked long or solemnly on any subject	at	all but some of them worried out loud about short memories and ghosts.	5.5728943206369905
4727. we saw giuseppe berto at a party once in a while tall lean	nervous and handsome and in our opinion the best novelist of them	all except pavese and pavese is dead.	3.689625272788384
4728. berto's the sky is	red had been a small masterpiece and in its special way the best book	to come out of the war.	6.513950582728404
4729. now he was married to a beautiful girl had	a small son and lived in an expensive apartment and worked for the	movies.	4.224664559874215
4730. on his desk was a slowly accumulating treatment and script of	the count of monte cristo.	6.369737288262279
4731. on his bookshelves were some of	the latest american novels including bellow's seize the day	but he hadn't read them and	wasn't especially interested in what the american writers were up	to.	3.956890817661638
4732. he was interested in robert musil's the man without qualities.	7.12153760913835
4733. so were a lot of other people.	7.499898802818945
4734. he was interested in italo	svevo.	9.933179007241588
4735. he was thinking his way into a new novel a big one one that	people had been waiting for.	4.263750333702858
4736. it was going to be hard going all the	way because he hadn't written seriously for a while except for a few	stories was tired of the old method of realismo he had so successfully	used in the sky is red.	6.01075561523676
4737. this one was going to be different.	8.703417053235196
4738. he had bought a little piece of property down along the coast	of the hard country of calabria that he knew so well.	5.6992530912275345
4739. he was going	to do one or two more films for cash and then chuck it all leave rome	and its intellectual cliques and money-fed life go back to calabria.	4.1434531869882
4740. he knew all about it and had put	it down in journal form in the war in a black shirt a wonderful	book not for some strange reason published in the us.	5.586138206113099
4741. he	knew all about the appeal of a black shirt and jackboots to a poor	southern peasant boy.	4.145078895167336
4742. he knew all about the infection and the fever	and too the moment of realization when he saw for himself threw up	his hands and quit ended the war as a prisoner in texas.	5.3308968353577875
4743. berto knew	all about fascism.	6.683325264329536
4744. so did his friend the young novelist rimanelli.	7.966298203912254
4745. rimanelli is tough and square-built and adventurous says what he	thinks.	4.681571082223364
4746. he had put it down in a war novel the day of the lion.	7.815197680461337
4747. these people were not talking much about it but you a foreigner	sensed their apprehension and disappointment.	4.318807026229827
4748. so there we were	talking around and about it.	7.695222726530779
4749. the english lady said she had to go	to vienna for a while.	4.376427388763144
4750. it was a pity because she had planned to lay	a wreath at the foot of the garibaldi statue towering over rome in	spectacular benediction from the highpoint of the gianicolo.	5.692251284040571
4751. around	that statue in the green park where children play and lovers walk in twos	and there is a glowing view of the whole city in that park are the	rows of marble busts of garibaldi's fallen men the ones who one	day rushed out of the porta san pancrazio and under fire all the way	up the long straight narrow lane to take then lose the high ground	of the villa doria pamphili.	3.642539867553032
4752. when they lost it the french artillery	moved in and that was the end for garibaldi that time on 30	april 1849.	6.562248721107485
4753. once out of the gate they had charged straight up the narrow	lane.	5.877824577268629
4754. we had walked it many times and shivered figuring what a	fish barrel it had been for the french.	6.9889026955940015
4755. now the park is filled with	marble busts and all the streets in the immediate area have the full and	proper names of the men who fell.	4.866010450338599
4756. we were at a party once and	heard an idealistic young european call that awful charge glorious.	6.296425121394819
4757. our companion was a huge plain-spoken american sculptor who had	been a sixteen-year-old rifleman all across france in 1944.	4.238799882847333
4758. he said	it was stupid butchery to order men to make a charge like that no	matter who gave the order and what for.	5.708164683313094
4759. oh it would be butchery	all right	the european said.	6.887253484758985
4760. we would see it that way but	it was glorious then.	7.446148460736292
4761. it was the last time in history anybody could	do something gloriously like that.	5.683450453259698
4762. i thought: who is	older now?	9.201259181702197
4763.  old world and new world.	6.999815552148169
4764. the sculptor looked at	him bugeyed and amazed angry.	5.998227019452429
4765. he had made an assault once with 180	men.	6.603994906943127
4766. it was a picked assault company.	9.906751992278904
4767. they went up against an ss	unit of comparable size over a little rise of ground over an open	field.	4.270939292431956
4768. they made it killed every last	one of the krauts took the village on schedule.	5.924461169522656
4769. when it was over	eight of his company were still alive and all eight were wounded.	5.168213024717182
4770. the	whole thing from the moment when they jumped heavily off the trucks	spread out and moved into position just behind the cover of that slight	rise of ground and then jumped off took maybe between twenty and	thirty minutes.	4.694348355282699
4771. the sculptor looked at him let the color drain out	of his face grinned and looked down into his drink a bad martini	made with raw italian gin.	3.45531042499369
4772. excuse me the european said.	8.18656221502958
4773. i am not familiar with	the expression.	7.682472669206153
4774. the apartment where we were talking that afternoon	in march faced onto the street garibaldi's men had charged	up and along.	4.889537613881
4775. across the way from the apartment building is a ruined	house shot to hell that day in 1849 and left that way as a memorial.	4.21696980585024
4776. there is a bronze wreath on the wall.	8.721007889534803
4777. like everything else in rome	ruins and monuments alike that house is lived in.	4.766529932219896
4778. i have seen diapers	strung across the ruined roof.	8.307554781455346
4779. the english lady really	wanted to put a wreath on the garibaldi monument on the 30th of april.	4.094726872158739
4780. she had her reasons for this.	9.635380913815608
4781. for one thing there wasn't going	to be any ceremony at all this year.	5.1958327189756845
4782. there were a few reasons for that	too: garibaldi had been taken up and exploited by the communists	nowadays.	6.986727936582718
4783. therefore the government wanted no part of him.	5.831969279453347
4784. sort of as if our government should decide to disown washington or lincoln	and then there were ecclesiastical matters	the matter of garibaldi's anti-clericalism.	5.051766433984403
4785. there was a new pope	and the vatican was making itself heard and felt these days.	5.045506273243667
4786. as	it happens the english lady is a good catholic herself but of more	liberal political persuasion.	6.172785358641656
4787. nothing was going to be done this year	to celebrate garibaldi's bold and unsuccessful defense of rome.	5.617281086419782
4788. all	that the english lady wanted to do was to walk up to the monument	and lay a wreath at its base.	5.832209614588485
4789. this would show that somebody even a foreigner	living in rome cared.	5.382104413037834
4790. and then there were other things.	9.963338055012752
4791. some	of the marble busts in the park are of young englishmen who fought	and died for garibaldi.	4.269124315979967
4792. she also mentioned leaving a little bunch	of flowers at the bust of lauro di bosis.	6.176563978485256
4793. it is hard for me	to know how i feel about lauro di bosis.	4.9941712738529125
4794. i suffer from mixed feelings.	9.201259181702197
4795. he was a well-to-do handsome and sensitive young poet.	6.203346332749885
4796. his bust	shows an intense mustached fine-featured face.	7.50023959705417
4797. he flew over rome	one day during the early days of mussolini and scattered leaflets over	the city denouncing the fascists.	4.499729740350072
4798. he was never heard of again.	10.644337625026855
4799. he is thought either to have been killed by the fascists as soon as	he landed or to have killed himself by flying out to sea and crashing	his plane.	4.233581125397791

4914. information application forms and assistance in filing may be	obtained from the office of minerals exploration us department	of the interior washington 25 dc or from the appropriate	regional office listed below:	in most of the less developed countries however such programing	is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent.	5.017508674406917
4915. only a very few of	the more advanced ones such as india and pakistan have developed	systematic techniques of programing.	4.465782385819627
4916. others have so-called development	plans but some of these are little more than lists of projects	collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals	without analysis of the actions required to attain them.	5.870033981972744
4917. only rarely	we	neither growth nor a development	program can be imposed on a country; it must express the nation's	own will and goal.	4.168621263828862
4918. nevertheless we can administer an aid program	in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing.	6.565009375279296
4919. first we can encourage responsibility by establishing	as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the	definition of objectives and the assessment of costs.	3.9367604808057832
4920. second	we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on	the consistency of such projects with the program.	5.454336586728915
4921. third	we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development	which are adapted to the country's objectives and resources.	4.030379497536024
4922. this	includes assistance in- h assembling the basic economic financial	technological and educational information on which programing depends;	h surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad	sectors of the economy such as transport agriculture communication	industry and power; h designing the financial mechanisms of the	economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation; and h	administrative practices which will make possible the more effective	we must use	the application of conditions	in the allocation	of aid funds cannot of course be mechanical.	4.4271614564535
4923. it must	be recognized that countries at different stages of development have	very different capabilities of meeting such conditions.	4.395122545375294
4924. to insist	on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond	the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration	of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage	more rapid growth.	4.821665516767758
4925. in the more primitive areas where the capacity	to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited some activities	may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them	before a well worked out program is available.	3.784366757076687
4926. thus we might provide	limited assistance in such fields as education essential transport	communications and agricultural improvement despite the absence of	acceptable country programs.	5.507936846797572
4927. in such a case however we would encourage	the recipient country to get on with its programing task supply	it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task and	make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance	to the country's development was conditional upon programing progress	being made.	3.5850007453484016
4928. at the other end of the spectrum where the	more advanced countries can be relied upon to make well thought through	decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program we should	be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval	as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support	in cooperation with other developed countries of the essential	foreign exchange requirements of the country's development program.	4.858676532442579
4929. a systematic approach to development budgeting and programing	is one important kind of self-help.	4.270512745051502
4930. it is vitally	important that the new us aid program should encourage all	of them since the main thrust for development must come from the less	developed countries themselves.	5.706646596686522
4931. external aid can only be marginal	although the margin as in the case of the marshall plan can be decisive.	5.128968236013997
4932. external aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help.	7.813356289256196
4933. us aid therefore should increasingly be designed to	provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves	can take.	4.340229011901879
4934. in establishing	conditions of self-help it is important that we not expect countries	to remake themselves in our image.	6.218283433202535
4935. open societies can take many forms	and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their	own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals.	3.5846015628445467
4936. on the other hand it is no interference with sovereignty to point	out defects where they exist such as that a plan calls for factories	without power to run them or for institutions without trained personnel	to staff them.	5.38160444826329
4937. once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned	with a country's development potential we can be blunt in suggesting	the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur.	4.308644722347639
4938. the major areas of self-help	are the following:	this includes not only development programing but also establishing	tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment;	fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation;	and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial	resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury	the reduction of dependence on external	sources.	4.410142759865955
4939. with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting	realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports.	4.163435386874098
4940. it also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate	tapping the energies of	for both economic and political reasons	all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth	of a country.	5.939240979496845
4941. otherwise development will not lead to longrun stability.	6.076938475589587
4942. in many societies what we	regard as corruption favoritism and personal influence are so accepted	as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part	of	routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination	will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted	but unfriendly.	4.665857390831757
4943. yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources	if dishonesty corruption and favoritism are widespread.	4.950407230437601
4944. moreover	tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion	of aid resources and in the long run generates anti-american	sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest.	5.576792526242471
4945. some	of the most dramatic successes of communism in winning local support	can be traced to the identification- correct or not- of communist	regimes with personal honesty and pro-western regimes with corruption.	3.698357725976017
4946. a requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically	uncomfortable in the short run but it is politically essential	in the long run.	5.676515830376243
4947. the united	states can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with	aid on a sustained basis tailored to priority needs to those countries	making serious efforts in self-help.	3.4515469268983323
4948. in many instances it	can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such	efforts.	5.900785408612993
4949. there are other countries where with skillful diplomacy	we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups	in government which would like to press forward with economic and social	reform measures to promote growth.	3.973200492687151
4950. but there will be still other countries where despite	the inadequacy of the level of self-help we shall deem it wise for political	or military reasons to give substantial economic assistance.	5.983686177008265
4951. even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that	our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to	termination.	4.7293706072483
4952. development	the most fundamental concept of	the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention our	resources and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and	social development of the less developed countries.	5.154266620462654
4953. this is not a short-run	goal.	9.474062028631767
4954. to have any success in this effort we must ourselves view	it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years	and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same	fashion.	5.3789529307558475
4955. how long it will take to show substantial success in this effort	will vary greatly from country to country.	4.493419224291226
4956. in several significant cases	such as india a decade of concentrated effort can launch these	countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic	and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance.	5.459331313917904
4957. these cases in which light is already visible at the other	end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb	gradually others will move up to	the number of countries thus favorably situated is	small but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the	underdeveloped world.	3.889927706961834
4958. meantime over the decade of the sixties we	can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big	push into self-sustaining growth.	5.260383971760662
4959. in still others which are barely on	the threshold of the transition into modernity the decade can bring	significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their	human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded	aid is a long-term	process stretching	over a considerable number of years to alter the basic social	and economic conditions in the less developed world.	3.5306515856051646
4960. it must be recognized	as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military	crises such as those recently confronted in laos and cuba.	5.912434889484095
4961. the specific reasons for a long-term approach the need to	many of the individual projects for	which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy	periods.	3.7681100343646876
4962. dams river development schemes transportation networks	educational systems require years to construct.	6.093123995732186
4963. moreover on complex	projects design work must be completed and orders for machinery	and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence.	4.172745624021586
4964. thus as a development program is being launched commitments and	obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by	twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year.	5.548817660411623
4965. the	capital expansion programs of business firms involve multi-year budgeting	the need	to plan investment programs.	4.305414028832856
4966. several of	the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through	experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for	at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more than	that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities	involved are all to take place in the proper sequence.	5.944771556001775
4967. without such	forward planning investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities	are completed before there is power to operate them or before	there is transport to service them; or a skilled labor force is trained	before there are plants available in which they can be employed.	3.8280621442758016
4968. most important	of all the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary	steps to allocate and commit their own resources.	5.882212969610807
4969. they must	be induced to establish the necessary tax fiscal monetary and regulatory	policies.	4.750109298580169
4970. they must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help	measures which are described in the preceding section.	5.994845121529558
4971. the taking	of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions.	4.320730508808147
4972. moreover	once these steps are taken they may require years to make themselves	felt.	6.472551235595096
4973. they must therefore be related to long-range development	plans.	5.902101604457995
4974. if the less developed countries	are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach the united states	as the principal supplier of external aid must be prepared to give	long-term commitments.	5.363603072955848
4975. in this as in so many aspects of our development	assistance activities the incentive effects of the posture we take	are the most important ones.	4.758018353885151
4976. the extent to which we can persuade	the less developed countries to appraise their own resources to set targets	toward which they should be working to establish in the light	of this forward	perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate	attention and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves	all on a realistic long-term basis will depend importantly	on the incentives we place before them.	4.8805569366059816
4977. if they feel that we are taking	a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into	reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities	they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required.	4.049149124483202
4978. perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear	evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we	have responded with long-term commitments.	6.2816009134383695
4979. you have heard him tell these young people that during his almost	50 years of service in the congress he has seen the kaisers and	the hitlers and the mussolinis the tojos and stalins and khrushchevs	come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest nation	that mankind has ever known.	3.7546117722334857
4980. then i have seen the pride of country	well in the eyes of these young people.	7.113834831415567
4981. so i say mr speaker	god bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body	but for the united states of america and the free world.	5.612069390105999
4982. you remember	the words of president kennedy a week or so ago when someone	asked him when he was in canada and dean rusk was in europe and	vice president johnson was in asia who is running the	store?	5.581724471696604
4983.  and he said the same fellow who has been running it sam	rayburn.	7.261549262686092
4984. mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members who desire	to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record;	and also that they may have 5 legislative days in which to extend	their remarks.	5.806043264787181
4985. is there objection	to the request of the gentleman from massachusetts?	5.8280186440243655
4986.    there was	no objection.	14.338098216555231
4987. it is notably significant that so many members	from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for	our beloved speaker the honorable sam rayburn.	4.126427315428448
4988. i purposely	refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from	the state of texas.	6.933693477816693
4989. i did so because i agree with so many here	today that he is the beloved speaker of all the people of the united	states.	5.555008082367263
4990. for the dignity the influence and the power of the legislative	branch of our government- it is a privilege for us to do honor	to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all	the people of our country.	5.6892026886628715
4991. to honor him is to honor ourselves.	5.881414571263852
4992. in this my first year as a member of this body i have experienced	many memorable moments.	7.350151486912471
4993. many of these experiences are so important	that they will be cherished forever by me.	5.9393942501483
4994. and like many of you here	present i hold as the highlight of all the occasion of my first meeting	with the honorable speaker of the house.	6.060177615785037
4995. at that time he afforded	me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as i may need	to speak about my background my hopes my views on various national	and local topics and any problems that i may have been vexed with	at the time.	3.7715206032788813
4996. he was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me	and tremendously wise in his counsel.	6.105809072969405
4997. in conclusion he wished me well-	and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express	himself he asked to be remembered to my wife and children.	3.71636452037786
4998. in	my short period here i believe that at no time has he been otherwise	than the most popular man on both sides of the aisle.	6.310793847549857
4999. he is most effective	in the ordinary business of the house and in the legislative	accomplishments of this session he easily rose to great occasion- even	at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle-	and as the nation witnessed these contests he rose even as admitted	by those who differed with him to the proportions of a hero and a	noble partisan.	4.020547559587993
5000. i am highly privileged today to commemorate the	brilliant career of this parliamentary giant.	6.531010144044969
5001. he will ever be my example	as a true statesman; one who is thoroughly human who affects	no dignity and who is endowed with real ability genuine worth and	sterling honesty- all dedicated to secure the best interests of the	country he has loved and served so long.	3.773826357931926
5002. may the divine speaker in	heaven bless this country with sam rayburn's continued service	here for years to come.	5.662199247561131
5003. it is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for	me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues	in this paean of praise respect and affection for speaker sam	rayburn.	4.175300902886093
5004. in this hour of crisis the wisdom the dedication the	stabilizing force that he represents in current american government	is an almost indispensable source of strength.	5.454847769962439
5005. he has become in this	half century the grand old man of american history.	4.857764255107459
5006. it seems to me	that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition	to providence that sam rayburn's vigor and his life remain	undiminished through the coming decades.	5.580132061376811
5007. here briefly in this	humble tribute i have sought for some simple and succinct summation	that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country.	3.9181136243703962
5008. but the task is beyond me because i hold it impossible to compress	in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions sam	rayburn has made as an individual as a legislator as a statesman	and as a leader and conciliator to the majestic progress of this	nation.	4.771877774054478
5009. it happens that i am a legislator from ohio and that i feel	deeply about the needs the aspirations the interests of my district	and my state.	4.3337996615148455
5010. what sam rayburn's life proves to us all is	the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and	with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests	of one's own community one's own district one's own state	and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of	the problems of this the greatest nation of all time.	4.484353727368249
5011. for sam	rayburn never forgot bonham his home community and he never	forgot texas.	4.707422446405762
5012. in the same way i like to think we owe our loyalty as	legislators to our community our district our state.	6.812263893499606
5013. and if we	follow the rayburn pattern as consciously or by an instinctual	political sense i like to think i have followed it then the very nature	of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected	in the devotion of our services to our country.	3.794637950195475
5014. for what sam	rayburn's life in this house teaches us is that loyalty and character	are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your	country and neglecting your district.	5.820329341312253
5015. there is no such thing as being	diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs.	5.359911311750878
5016. the	two are as one.	8.978076491592427
5017. this may not be the greatest but it certainly comes	close to being the greatest lesson sam rayburn's career up to	this hour teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political	life under our processes of government.	4.309799503265513
5018. more than that	sam rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity	so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count	some of his best friends in the opposition.	5.420475722534901
5019. through the most rancorous	battles of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national	and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example	of dignity and honesty forthrightness and nobility.	3.966268672072044
5020. sam rayburn	has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and	ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political	manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions.	4.9560228697535775
5021. this means much to	the american tradition.	6.834975815604573
5022. it is an answer in its way individual and	highly dramatic to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily	vicious in its campaign characteristics.	5.680501322976798
5023. and the name rayburn	is one of the most dominant in the history of american politics for	the last half century.	5.826754040985278
5024. it is i insist hard to define the	rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is	so massive and so widespread and so complicated and because it goes	so deep.	5.111205856992273
5025. but this we know: here is a great life that in every area	of american politics gives the american people occasion for pride	and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities	of honor decency and self-respect.	4.189016495298703
5026. i pray to god that he may	be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the united	states and the whole world can ill afford to lose.	6.227744050743681
5027. of hon melvin price of illinois	all but two	of my nine terms in the house of representatives has been served under	the speakership of sam rayburn.	4.568506039981732
5028. of this i am proud.	11.743629525949098
5029. i have	a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility	with which he carries his greatness.	4.53830371347421
5030. and sam rayburn	is a great man- one who will go down in american history as a truly	great leader of the nation.	6.096675257508536
5031. he will be considered not only great	among his contemporaries but as great among all the americans who	have played a part in the country's history since the beginning.	4.323577750013741
5032. i pay my personal tribute to sam rayburn stalwart texan and	great american not only because today he establishes a record of	having served as speaker of the house of representatives more than	twice as long as henry clay but because of the contributions he has	made to the welfare of the people of the nation during his almost half	century of service as a member of congress.	6.2264330645604185
5033. speaker rayburn	has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction	of the house in the speaker's chair.	4.150730573600996
5034. he had an outstanding record	as a legislator since the start of his career in the house in 1913	the 63d congress.	7.362715195903962
5035. no one has sponsored more progressive and important	legislation than has sam rayburn.	5.309242605217708
5036. he is the recognized father	of the rural electrification administration and the security	and exchange commission.	7.1445507164330015
5037. but to run the gauntlet of the programs	sam rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts	would fill the pages of today's record.	4.198847242270938
5038. no greater pleasure	has come to me in my own service in this house than to be present	today to participate in this tribute to this great speaker this great	legislator this great texan this great american.	5.0929907587230305
5039. my sincere	wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today.	4.736551077444031
5040. sam rayburn is one of the greatest american public figures	in the history of our country and i consider that i have been	signally honored in the privilege of knowing sam rayburn and sharing	with him the rights and obligations of a member of the house of	representatives in the congress of the united states.	6.1852309730935895
5041. others	may speak of speaker rayburn's uniquely long and devoted	service; of his championship of many of the progressive social measures	which adorn our statute books today and of his cooperation in times	of adversity with presidents of both of our major parties in helping	to pilot the ship of state through the shoals of today's stormy	international seas.	3.4695774459838313
5042. i prefer to speak however of sam rayburn	the person rather than sam rayburn the american institution.	5.748803954023007
5043. although sam rayburn affects a gruff exterior in	many instances nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart	and gentle disposition.	4.48293447341993
5044. no one could be more devoted than he to the	american congress as an institution and more aware of its historical	significance in the political history of the world and i shall never	forget his moving talks delivered in simple yet eloquent words upon	the meaning of our jobs as representatives in the operation of representative	government and their importance in the context of today's	assault upon popular government.	5.167329763114571
5045. above all he is a person to	whom a fledgling representative can go to discuss the personal and professional	problems which inevitably confront a new congressman.	4.449384435616152
5046. in	this role of father confessor he has always been most characteristic	and most helpful.	5.971688525502195
5047. on september 16 sam rayburn will have	served as speaker twice as long as any predecessor and i am proud	to join with others in marking this date and in expressing my esteem	for that notable american sam rayburn.	3.8292066271732454

5052. the motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive	management including establishment of cost billing systems records	keeping analyses of vehicle use and effecting economies in vehicle	operation.	4.668996872631617
5053. cars were operated in 1959 for an average .	5.047186237627939
5054. purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state	purchases.	6.289010577019261
5055. unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to	the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state	sales or federal excise taxes.	4.082606251166905
5056. assignment and	the legislature's role in policy determination concerning	state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to	appropriating funds for vehicles.	5.2920541105344485
5057. the meaningful policies governing	the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles have	been shaped by the state's administrative officers.	3.6398110151839265
5058. meaningful	policies include:	when cars should be traded the need and assignment of vehicles	use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances employees taking cars	home and need for liability insurance on state automobiles.	4.784783663292438
5059. the state purchases	and assigns grades of cars according to need and position status	the purchase of compact	cars	the factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible	unsuccessful efforts have been	it is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage	the state has recently undertaken	automobile practices	a survey of practices andor policies in other	states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals	several points for comparison with rhode island's practices.	3.357091579637971
5060. forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state	business.	6.289010577019261
5061. two other states provide vehicles but only with legislative	approval.	5.964088458344651

5063. twenty-six states operate a central motor pool for acquisition	allocation andor maintenance of state-owned vehicles.	4.21292691591616
5064. nineteen states report laws policies or regulations for assigning state	vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances.	5.508733994043736
5065. of these states the	average change-over point	is 13200 miles per year.	5.612762191501938
5066. mileage	allowances for state employees are of two types: actual mileage	and fixed monthly allowances.	5.7836982265615156
5067. actual mileage allowances	are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personally-owned	vehicles on state business at the rate of .	4.8256116768273145
5068. fixed	monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except	on a non-itemized basis.	6.436738270865487
5069. both allowances are governed by conditions and	restrictions set forth in detail in the state's travel regulations.	4.512014628199465

5073. rhode island's rate of .	6.214779987722582
5074. 07 per mile is considerably lower than	reimburseable rates in the federal government and in industry nationally	which approximate a .	5.966389874764468
5075. actual mileage	allowances are well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state.	4.535752126583474
5076. the travel regulations requirements and procedures governing reimbursement	are controlled properly and not overly restrictive.	5.3612613956075945
5077. fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject.	5.3285636594893
5078. they have a great	advantage in ease of audit time and payment.	7.739879792223702
5079. however they lend themselves	to abuse and inadequate control measures.	5.540475598092698
5080. flat payments over	$50 per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of	state-owned vehicles.	6.029705977747775

5082. with few	exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses	and $15 per day subsistence.	6.029969712640202
5083. travel allowances are well-regulated	and pose little problem in administration andor audit control.	4.411891185517149
5084. of state automobile practices	it	is difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles	for use of employees in rhode island.	6.5289621630268755
5085. few records are available	concerning the subject prior to 1940.	5.4291806815114345
5086. those that are available	shed little light.	10.046554100956959
5087. the registry of motor vehicles indicates that	at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917.	3.903457343307019
5088. it	should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles	is at least forty years old.	7.618718663638878
5089. the best reason that can be	advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded	highway construction during the 1920s and '30s.	3.996504069214495
5090. at that time highway	engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties.	7.1138207562853095
5091. using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees	and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly	justifiable.	4.5543005374175225
5092. once the principle was established the increase	in state-owned vehicles came rapidly.	7.179544900430289
5093. and reasons other than employee	need contributed to the growth.	5.8708142707608895
5094. table 1 immediately below shows	the rate of growth of vehicles and employees.	5.926734816808145
5095. this rate of increase	does not signify anything in itself.	4.987041256881453
5096. it does not indicate loose management	ineffective controls or poor policy.	8.439965501912711
5097. but it does show that automobiles	have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same	proportion to the increase of state employees.	4.513515179273017
5098. in the past twenty	years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied	from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now.	5.703083417225485
5099. whether there were too few automobiles	in 1940 or too many now is problematical.	4.7505296763602916
5100. the fact is simply	that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion	history and operation of the motor	pool.	6.13140083227211
5101. subsequent developments concerning the assignment use and management	of state automobiles can be related more clearly.	4.157554044369504
5102. prior to 1942	automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which	assigned.	7.658985996292512
5103. this responsibility included all phases of management.	6.036066170183462
5104. it	embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles who	was to drive when and where repairs were to be made where gasoline	and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters.	5.617041063080036
5105. in 1942 however the nation was at war.	5.7202455055248365
5106. gasoline and automobile tires	were rationed commodities.	7.603896187885215
5107. the state was confronted with transportation	problems similar to those of the individual.	5.707762367174441
5108. it met these problems	by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit	a centralized operation for the maintenance	and control of all state transportation.	6.266157360301137
5109. the motor pool then	as now had headquarter facilities in providence and other garages located	throughout the state.	3.7634143055761555
5110. it was organizationally the responsibility	of the department of public works and was financed on a rotary fund	basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation.	5.578374410621998
5111. in 1951 the pool's operation was transferred to the newly-created	department of administration an agency established as the	central staff and auxiliary department of the state government.	4.181886836014643
5112. the management	of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in	a recent report in the following manner:   under this new	management considerable progress appears to have been made.	5.154435343342229
5113. the agencies	of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided	to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all	cars.	3.767750532590717
5114. whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained	losses considerably beyond expectations the introduction of the cost-billing	system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping	the fund on a proper working basis.	5.518574209335109
5115. one indication of the merits of	the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956	while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35% the	total maintenance cost increased only 11%.	4.395565135178568
5116. in order	to further refine the management of passenger vehicles on july 1 1958	the actual title to every vehicle was transferred by executive	order to the division of methods research and office services.	4.848915820799214
5117. the objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility	for the management assignment and replacement of all vehicles.	3.677026609786886
5118. this tied in closely with the	current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles	are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs	become excessive.	5.362015955648632
5119. moreover it allows the present management	to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly	distributed throughout the fleet; for example if one driver puts on	22000 miles per year and another driver 8000 miles per year their	cars will be switched so that both cars will have 30000 miles after two	years rather than 44000 miles	and 16000 miles respectively.	3.420123134066361
5120. the motor pool is a completely	centralized and mechanized operation.	5.803860821377457
5121. it handles all types of	vehicle maintenance but concentrates more on service station activities	than on extensive vehicle repairs.	4.309941617365307
5122. it contracts with outside	repair garages for much of the latter work.	9.003526936177147
5123. where the pool excels is	in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses.	4.821697341274658
5124. pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon	of each vehicle the miles traveled in one year or three years the periods	when vehicle costs become excessive and when cars should be traded	for sound economies.	4.669704854261235
5125. from this motor pool personnel develop other	meaningful and related data.	5.61920114426022
5126. in 1959-60 vehicles averaged an operating	cost of .	7.196162898152894
5127. based on this figure and considering depreciation	costs of vehicles pool personnel have determined that travel	in excess of 10000 miles annually is more economical by state car	than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles.	3.6287722345492877
5128. they	estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data	of compact cars is compiled the break-even point may be reduced to	7500 miles of travel per year.	4.919953094486945
5129. table 2 shows operating cost data of	state vehicles selected at random.	4.535752126583474
5130. one matter of concern to	the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate	central garage facilities.	6.29792330570903
5131. present pool quarters at two locations in	providence are crowded antiquated and in general make for inefficient	operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of	such operational needs as stock and repair equipment.	3.750451701031276
5132. good facilities	would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle	costs even more.	5.926414520364321
5133. the purchase of state-owned	vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases	of the state.	4.718383369643341
5134. requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary	cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will	be made.	5.5057919184807975
5135. bids are evaluated by the division of purchases with the	assistance of pool staff and awards for the purchase of the automobiles	are made to the lowest responsible bidders.	3.953665167388943
5136. unit prices for state	vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public.	6.674689088089541
5137. the reasons	are obvious: it has no	federal excise or state sales tax to pay.	4.0485270579971635
5138. until 1958 the state was also	entitled to a special type of manufacturers' discount through the	dealers.	6.074301946356675
5139. in that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state	motor pool cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies	but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier.	3.8962603896975674
5140. this is a normal	governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting	principles.	7.584675229623171
5141. the assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is	another matter to be covered in detail later.	3.98584887368512
5142. assignment and use policies	probably the most important of all matters	for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase	assignment use and management of state vehicles.	5.267304157933302
5143. the legislature's	role in policy determination in this area for years has been	confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually	for the purchase and operation of vehicles.	3.987003162060012
5144. the more meaningful policies	have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer	of the state- the director of administration.	6.0675171011712195
5145. there was a time some years ago when	local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their	own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as	well.	5.420114173380758
5146. for many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the	several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property	tax.	6.51053406118285
5147. this tax was discontinued in 1936.	5.860285214927587
5148. since that time	the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed	financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in	earlier years.	6.29361416911308
5149. at the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion	of municipal services as well.	5.822801329653132
5150. thus there has come into being	a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and	in addition must give assistance to its local governments.	6.2441213023095195
5151. this	financial assistance from the state has become necessary because	the local governments themselves found the property tax or at least at	the rates then existing insufficient for their requirements.	4.09102670589184
5152. consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and	shared taxes as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments	for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a	sales tax at the state level.	5.525203355828479
5153. notwithstanding state aid the local	governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own	by strengthening the property tax.	3.9394316778493597
5154. this is being done both by the revaluation	of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property	hitherto neglected or ignored.	6.026132377249047
5155. taxation of tangible movable	property in rhode island has been generally of a hands off nature	due possibly to several reasons: local assessors in the main	are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs the numerous	categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely	difficult and the inexperience of the majority of assessors	problems of taxing personal	property.	3.3992003965199955
5156. and of movable tangible property in particular two are significant:	situs fair and equitable assessment of value.	6.0504390401147665
5157. these	problems are not local to rhode island but are recognized as common	to all states.	4.3225270261685695
5158. although the laws of the various	states in general specify the situs of property ie residence	or domicile of the owner or location of the property the exceptions	regarding boats airplanes mobile homes etc seem to add to	the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment.	4.97418409639776
5159. rhode island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the	town in which it is situated.	4.614641270222381
5160. it also provides for the taxation of all	personal property belonging to inhabitants of the state both tangible	and intangible and the tangible personal property of non-residents	in this state.	5.828139341593011
5161. in defining personal property it specifically mentions	all ships or vessels at home or abroad.	4.3721244700667725
5162. intangible	property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater	portion of the year.	5.594031732604857
5163. although a similar situs for tangible property	is mentioned in the statute this is cancelled out by the provision	that definite kinds of property and all other tangible property	situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated.	3.685958987712332
5164. this would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property	at its location on december 31.	6.392992459471869
5165. both boats and aircraft would	fall within this category as well as motor vehicles.	5.532678347088327
5166. the location	of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration	and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle	as being situated where it is garaged.	5.546186238726411
5167. obviously it would be impossible	to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of december.	4.911157742702036
5168. in view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles	for tax purposes in the absence of any specific provision it would	seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or	aircraft.	5.8753881279509415
5169. a recent example of this problem is the flying of six	airplanes on december 31 1960 from the newport airpark in middletown	to the north central airport in smithfield.	3.962874001877746
5170. this situation	resulted in both towns claiming the tax and probably justifiably.	6.235752476069656
5171. middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that all	rateable property both tangible and intangible shall be taxed	to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his	actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve months	next preceding the first day of april in each year.	3.806030231832548
5172. the	smithfield tax assessor in turn claims the tax under the provision	of law h and all other tangible personal property situated or being	in any town in or upon any h place of storage h shall be taxed	to such person h in the town where said property is situated.	4.535188750544296
5173. this problem of fair and equitable assessment	of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of	fair valuation is dependent on local assessors who in general are	non-professional	and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach	to the problem.	3.7612992365637568
5174. this accounts for the wide variance in assessment	practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in	rhode island.	5.666094798501576
5175. this condition will undoubtedly continue until	such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established	or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method	of standard assessment practice to be adopted.	3.7892914776620588
5176. the rhode	island public expenditure council in its publication once commented:	the most realistic way of facing up to this problem would	be to have the state take over full responsibility for assessing	all taxable property.	4.780151528748442
5177. an adequately staffed and equipped state assessing	office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far	toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout	the state.	3.7979247938927747
5178. a single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences	and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different	and independent assessing units.	5.355784073966382
5179. the institute of public	administration in its report to the state fiscal study commission	in 1959 recommended consolidating and centralizing all aspects	of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally	organized and equipped for the job.	3.720909864310434
5180. the resulting setup it was	declared would be similar to that which is in successful operation	in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than rhode	island.	5.931881983556387
5181. to determine the practice	and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property	a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or	boards of assessors in rhode island.	4.0735870737340445
5182. the replies from each	individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the	personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the	established policy of the town in each case.	5.1894976421232055
5183. there are legitimate reasons	for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among	the public officials in each town.	4.37346530383073
5184. these opinions of the assessors	are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at	the present time.	6.101121878262878
5185. in reply to a question of whether they now	tax boats airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles	nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not.	4.05198584111277
5186. the wording	of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different	interpretations.	5.8691680610025765
5187. one assessor checked boats only another trailers	and tractors one mentioned house trailers and two others referred	to trailers without specifying the type.	4.041376835569566
5188. in two cases airplanes only	were indicated.	8.124467990507934
5189. it is difficult to tabulate exactly what was	meant in each individual situation but the conclusion may be drawn	that 21 towns do not assess movable personal property and of the remainder	only certain types are valued for tax purposes.	3.8573115443151407
5190. boats were indicated	specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats.	7.304041596771987
5191. it would seem then that movable property and equipment is not taxed	as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound	to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property.	3.8626392305847164
5192. so few answered the question relating to their efforts to assess	movable property that the results are inconclusive.	5.909381077682253
5193. only four towns indicated	that they made any more than a normal effort to list property	of this kind.	5.183940096276628
5194. of greater interest is a question as to whether	movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership.	6.676501770503539
5195. fifteen stated that it was according to location four by residence	of the owner and nineteen did not answer.	4.647628949362133
5196. twenty-seven assessors	stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable	personal property and only five were opposed.	6.501820951253952
5197. seven others expressed	no opinion.	7.794039523550236
5198. on this point there was fairly general agreement that	assessors would like to do more than they are doing now.	7.48021767628702
5199. it is not	clear however whether they are thinking of all movable property or	only of boats trailers aircraft or certain other types of personal	property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns.	3.729884110243962
5200. another question that was asked of the assessors was whether	they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or	at the residence of the owner.	5.098876504953099
5201. eighteen voted for assessment by the	town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town	in which the owner resides.	4.142011428992033
5202. ten others made no reply.	8.840894576046342
5203. of those who	have an opinion it seems that assessment by location is preferred.	5.324548254241674
5204. there	was one vote for location being the place where the property is	situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment	date.	5.72693282377105
5205. to summarize it may be said that there is no one	prevailing practice in rhode island with respect to the taxation	of movable property that assessors would like to see an improvement	and of those who have an opinion that assessment by the town of location	is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge.	4.937756853280104
5206. the need for	greater knowledge is evident from their replies.	6.566113871376985
5207. property	interest has been shown for a number	of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats.	4.381490901122469
5208. assessors in rhode island are charged not only with placing a valuation	upon real and personal property but they also have the responsibility	to raise by a tax a sum not less than nor more than a specified	amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting.	4.968886324540994
5209. it has been obvious to the assessors particularly those in shore	communities that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal	property which they have been unable to reach.	4.491881797706624
5210. through their	professional organization the rhode island tax officials association	the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed.	5.541166731394555
5211. no satisfactory solution has been found but this is due more to the	difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence	on the part of the assessors.	5.0595065301949145
5212. it has been estimated that	the value of boats in rhode island waters is something in excess	of fifty million dollars excluding commercial boats.	5.8851089954527405
5213. it is obvious that	this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors	of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be	subject to taxation.	3.923641497051162
5214. it is known that at least five towns	place some	value on some boats for tax purposes.	7.195184479506313
5215. however few are taxed and	the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on	the date of assessment of town valuations.	4.0240771587037205
5216. no one really knows	how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may	be.	6.363263733543404
5217. slightly more than 5000 boats were registered with the coast guard	prior to the recent passage of the state boating law.	4.541009256512224
5218. only a few	more than 10000 boats had been registered with the division of harbors	and rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season but many had	been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought	the season to an early close.	5.919776523859772
5219. the assessors' association	meeting at narragansett in september 1960 devoted its session to a	discussion of the boat problem.	3.7179193381860367
5220. local industry's investment in rhode island was the big story	in 1960's industrial development effort.	6.115157467186148
5221. fifty-two companies started	or committed themselves to new plant construction totaling 1418000	square feet and representing an investment of $11900000; a	new post-world war 2 record.	3.725131536371901
5222. with minor exceptions this expansion	was instituted either by firms based in rhode island or out-of-state	manufacturers already operating here.	5.80506156606546
5223. what made these new	location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960	was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation rhode	island scored marked progress in new industry new plants and new jobs.	3.9590436006485
5224. of the major expansions in 1960 three were financed under	the r i industrial building authority's 100% guaranteed	mortgage plan: collyer wire leesona corporation and american	tube + controls.	5.629473065061098
5225. leading firms that arranged their own financing	included speidel corporation cornell-dubilier photek inc	division of textron narragansett gray iron foundry w r	cobb company and mays manufacturing company.	3.6624378113166105
5226. expansion	and relocation of industry in rhode island is the direct responsibility	of the development council's industrial division and the figures	quoted above indicate a successful year's operation.	5.059371402848546
5227. industrial	division personnel worked with 54 out-of-state and 97 rhode island	concerns during 1960 many of whom are still interested in a rhode	island location.	3.7605603237349414
5228. they are conscious of this state's new feeling	of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of	aids to	small business	although much of the industrial division's promotional	effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by	major industries small business is also afforded considerable attention.	5.187214442763492
5229. our office of foreign and domestic commerce carries on a vigorous	program directly aimed at solving and expediting the problems of	manufacturers in the lower employment categories.	3.9455617543037214

5270. division	stated in its simplest terms the main job of the	planning division is to plan for the future of the state of rhode	island.	7.1876051331743955
5271. the activities of the planning division are defined in considerable	detail in the enabling act of the development council which	assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties	in the field of planning.	3.6484230246968363
5272. two years ago the institute of	public administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled	state-local relations in metropolitan rhode island.	6.661689982483162
5273. as	the result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained in	this report plus an analysis of our own enabling act the planning	division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused	a reorientation of its work program.	4.120311064757553
5274. these objectives are stated here	because of their importance in understanding the current activities	first priority will be given to	the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background	recognizing	the truth of the statement by the institute of public administration	that metropolian planning means or	should mean state planning the state guide plan will take into account	the metropolitan nature of many of rhode island's problems.	4.685617380984669
5275. it will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage	the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility	of local government.	5.029022155065229
5276. to this end the community assistance program	of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function	to make available on a shared cost basis technical planning	assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their	the planning division will take the initiative	in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government;	among the operating departments of the state; between the cities	and towns of the state; and on a regional basis between the six new	on the basis that all citizens of the state	are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources	plans for the provision of essential services will	be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries within	the state development budget	will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority	of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan.	4.658310631391594
5277. particular attention will	be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the	development of industry and recreation.	4.696670946785143
5278. functionally the planning	division carries out four activities: long-range state planning	current state planning local planning assistance; and the preparation	of the state development budget.	5.051766433984403
5279. the planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive	state planning program in the nation.	3.8769026757968397
5280. the long range aspects of	this program are divided into four distinct phases: basic mapping	inventory analysis and plan and policy formation.	5.2999824815312175
5281. the work program	as it was originally proposed was to take five years to complete.	4.726939249794418
5282. recent	events- particularly the necessity of providing planning information	for the statewide origindestination study of the department	of public works- indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated.	6.376302289188441
5283. the basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and	basic	since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning	program the first step taken by the planning division to implement the	long range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps-	one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile and the second a series of 26 sheets	at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet covering the entire state.	3.767067289522917
5284. with	these maps completed the inventory phase of the plan has been started.	6.872861709862811
5285. with the aid of matching federal funds available	under section 701 of the housing act of 1954 as amended the planning	division began a one year program july 1 1960 to complete the inventory	phase of the state planning program.	3.994045728023419
5286. this phase consists of four	items: urban land use rural land use physical features and public	utility service areas.	5.45818851704242
5287. since the validity of all subsequent planning	depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information great care	is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible.	4.3247548011987185
5288. the urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff	has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are	of significance to statewide planning.	4.677883612152886
5289. the rural land use study is	being carried out under contract by the university of rhode island	and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use.	3.9984845391315322
5290. the mapping of important physical features such as slopes and types	of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to	public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and	like the other two inventory projects are scheduled for completion	july 1 1961.	4.44433054918692
5291. the collection of information is meaningless	unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose.	3.942420685597969
5292. it is not within the scope of	this report elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in	rhode island.	5.980549813036615
5293. however a word should be mentioned in regard to them	as independent units of government.	5.223499201718311
5294. there are forty-seven special	district governments in rhode island	districts four housing authorities and the kent county water	.	5.996984900759701
5295. these forty-seven special purpose governments have the	authority to levy taxes to borrow money own property sue and be sued	and in general to exercise normal corporate powers.	3.736478075476027
5296. unlike cities	and towns however they do not have to submit any financial statements	to the state bureau of audits.	7.138473300207697
5297. it is not an exaggeration to say	that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units	of government.	5.039134914707333
5298. in addition to the collection of service charges	the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450000.	6.384670847065284
5299. a	review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent	to this report.	4.305414028832856
5300. included in the findings are:  forty-six	states including rhode island end their fiscal year on june	30.	6.004438176423661
5301. the other four states end on varying dates: alabama	new york and texas	.	4.585148982842573
5302. in sixteen states the fiscal year ending of the	cities is the same as that of the state: alaska arizona	california delaware massachusetts montana nevada new mexico	north carolina north dakota oklahoma oregon vermont	.	5.748691224818891
5303. in eleven states	the fiscal year of the cities ends on december 31 while the state fiscal	year ends on june 30	hampshire new jersey ohio south dakota utah washington	.	3.6872571296465737
5304. in eight states whose fiscal years close	on june 30 a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on december	31:	.	5.425304578814461
5305. one state alabama closes	its fiscal year on september 30 and all cities in the state with	one exception also close fiscal years on september 30.	4.294404436486582
5306. mississippi closes its fiscal year on june 30 while all of its cities	close their fiscal years on september 30.	5.520943077314587
5307. pennsylvania closes	its fiscal year on may 31.	5.4032093454026695
5308. all of its cities close their fiscal	years on december 31.	8.322543737162293
5309. the remaining twelve states have varying	fiscal years for the state city and local governments.	4.241336465945757
5310. however	only illinois oregon louisiana and rhode island have a situation	in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal	uniformity.	5.375751660322602
5311. an excellent summary of advantages concerning	the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained	in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently.	3.9642356482184575
5312. he listed	among the values of fiscal uniformity:  the uniform fiscal	year requires compliance with common sense administration of local	finances: adoption of the budget or financial plan in advance of spending.	5.16084941818072
5313. the uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another	common sense rule that of having cash in the bank before checks	are drawn.	3.6061427736109843
5314. it enables towns to make more economical purchases and to	take advantage of cash discounts.	6.424491095487325
5315. the uniform fiscal year promotes	more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures.	4.012692518953268
5316. by fixing the tax rate in advance of spending upper limits are set	on expenditures.	6.2273417631016175
5317. the uniform fiscal year brings the town's	fiscal year into line with that of the schools which expend the largest	share of local disbursements.	4.221285330919581
5318. this greatly simplifies the town's	bookkeeping and financial reporting.	7.006468312365853
5319. the uniform fiscal	year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax	anticipation notes.	4.305571238319879
5320. furthermore tax collections not immediately needed	for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes	augmenting the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax	levy.	5.229078353365337
5321. the uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison	of revenues and expenditures.	4.200670158663773
5322. when towns have the same fiscal	year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons; and as the	cost of local government increases the demand for such comparison also	increases.	5.962030723038709
5323. towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare.	4.855658467968249
5324. of all advantages probably none is more important than	the elimination of tax anticipation notes.	6.7718936628812285
5325. borrowing in anticipation	of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority	of municipalities at all times.	3.9467684538002374
5326. it may be by bank loans sale	of notes or warrants or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and	registration of warrants.	5.823905697881438
5327. in any event it is a form of borrowing which	could be and should be rendered unnecessary.	6.178012508117614
5328. its elimination would	result in the saving of interest costs heavy when short-term money rates	are high and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always	available when needed most.	5.154531500855507
5329. this type of borrowing can be reduced	to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted	and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year.	4.056320554139384
5330. any	approach	toward such a system looks toward saving and security.	6.522871687113793
5331. it should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons	for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform	fiscal year.	5.399159918171722
5332. both the federal and state governments commence their	fiscal years on july 1.	6.778059077523185
5333. both units of government contribute increasingly	large sums of money to the several local governments in this	state as indicated below:    it has been said that when local	government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property	tax the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap; but with	the growth of state and federal fiscal aid the emphasis on equalization	and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important	functions this is no longer true.	3.8956659448775266
5334. the haphazard fiscal year calendar	is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local	revenue and expenditure relationships.	5.040372803839409
5335. although	there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal	years in rhode island there are also certain difficulties encountered.	4.220701333930838
5336. these involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal	uniformity than they do actual actual disadvantages to the principle.	5.553891161768655
5337. one problem is a matter of shifting dates; the other is how to	finance the transition.	5.055677198332572
5338. little can be done about the changing	of dates.	8.697720814160544
5339. this is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars.	6.165550706691331
5340. it	usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period	of time.	5.926734816808145
5341. but cooperation and understanding between local officials	and the citizenry help lessen this problem.	4.549528695919972
5342. the other problem	is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities	and towns.	6.247059914472752
5343. this will be covered more fully later.	6.8910001276370085
5344. it should be kept	in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can	convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial	condition of that town or city.	5.392713692527666
5345. fortunately there are no cities or towns	in the state with one or two possible exceptions that are in too	difficult a position to finance the proposed change.	4.556060747128479
5346. sacrifice will	have to be made in some cases but it is to the municipality's advantage	to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than	pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely.	6.7163148890408335
5347. fiscal calendars	the advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well	synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great	for rhode island municipalities to exert effort to secure them.	3.7228467551011133
5348. the	type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent	of the adjustments needed.	6.1393793535393035
5349. two features are immediately evident.	7.194228478107291
5350. first	the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single	formula.	6.12989474741227
5351. second the shift to a uniform july 1-june 30 fiscal year	will of itself improve the tax collection calendars of the great	majority of cities and towns.	3.9458616160753954
5352. there are at least two problems to consider:	one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar; the other	is how to finance the adjustments when necessary.	6.252801674055868
5353. the latter matter	is considered in detail in a later section.	4.9847539164602885
5354. twelve cities and	towns in rhode island presently indicate some plans to establish a	uniform andor coordinated fiscal-tax year calendar.	5.43902246593565
5355. plans vary from	the talking stage to establishing special committees to accomplish	this end.	4.411891185517149
5356. what is important here is that many of the cities and towns	recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the	initiative to obtain them.	6.9589351302232325
5357. an analysis of the fiscal-tax collection	year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition	may not be as painful as is commonly thought.	4.193444410092113
5358. however it must be stressed	that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual	cities and towns involved.	6.695077822180136
5359. the adjustments needed to establish	a uniform and coordinated fiscal-tax collection year calendar throughout	rhode island based on a july 1-june 30 year are shown below.	3.675477134381489
5360. six cities and towns are presently on a	july 1-june 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection	year with it.	5.512715302422695
5361. no change is required for these towns.	6.039439933523581
5362. these municipalities	include: barrington lincoln middletown newport north	kingstown and south kingstown.	6.672929159659425
5363. one town and one city coventry and east providence require an adjustment	of their fiscal year only.	4.34762191062725
5364. this change will automatically adjust	their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments	due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year.	5.240929249536284
5365. six cities and towns are now	on a july 1-june 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their	tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity.	3.868114896133369
5366. these cities and	towns include bristol glocester pawtucket cumberland central	falls and woonsocket.	6.439595567446343
5367. two cities	to be considered providence and cranston are an enigma.	5.208641873163047
5368. both have	excellent integration of their fiscal-tax collection year calendars.	7.279710921728837
5369. however neither of these two cities is on the desired july 1-june	30 fiscal year.	5.1257319590989505
5370. the adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal	period could be accomplished relatively easy for them.	5.230782446082564
5371. in that	both cities end their fiscal years on september 30 they could levy taxes	for an interim period of nine months commencing with september	30 and ending with june 30.	3.6601760327854405
5372. these three installment dates would be:	october 26 january 26 and april 25 and november	15 february 16 and may 15.	5.4143090744001565
5373. both would start their new	fiscal year on july 1.	5.419053398104491
5374. their tax collection calendar could then be:	july 25 october 26 january 26 and april 25;	and august 15 november 15 february 17 and may 15.	5.154300802449603
5375. under this plan both cranston and providence would be on the uniform	fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods.	4.452471099215811
5376. the remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal	years which end prior to june 30.	5.390500575037483
5377. all of these towns will require	adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years.	5.28997237623832
5378. assuming	an adjustment to the july 1-june 30 fiscal year the required adjustment	of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in table	3.	5.1646622214268945
5379. aside from the matter	of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars there is the problem of financing	the adjustment when this is necessary.	5.108264631955414
5380. it should be emphasized	strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets	do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental	requirements.	5.822775210569197
5381. in many communities there is simply no financial	problem; it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods careful	fiscal planning and management or some like combination of techniques.	4.6324384840913835
5382. in other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial	burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of	fiscal year changes.	5.760927526725712
5383. fortunately such cases in rhode island are more	the exception than the rule.	4.920353554239155
5384. as shown earlier in table 1	the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection	calendars.	5.942387776568827
5385. in addition no two rhode island communities are identical	in relation to their over-all financial condition.	4.676303695985141
5386. these factors	practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible; each	situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration	such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective	tax calendars the financial condition of the treasuries and the length	of the transition interval.	4.9238574220931595
5387. suitable plans range from those that are	very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require	borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds.	3.6702446493523304
5388. the financial problem where it exists usually stems from	the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period.	5.088173283468006
5389. for	those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments	there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone	or in combination with others would minimize if not even eliminate the	problem.	4.113843039348441
5390. governor	the theme of rhode island heritage week for 1961 will	be independence and union.	6.122585363811391
5391. it commemorates the 185th anniversary	of rhode island's independence when upon may 4 1776 the	general assembly by its action established the first free republic	in the new world.	3.8318373578752256
5392. as this year marks the centennial of the	beginning of the civil war this fact is being commemorated with several	exhibits throughout the state but most of all paying tribute to	the first rhode island volunteers who rushed to the defense of the	city of washington putting at the disposal of president lincoln	the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time.	4.9006973830360865

5496. this consists of 25 individual	registries two of which were added during fiscal years 1959-1960	.	6.092131302224837
5497. these registries are sponsored by 18 national medical	dental and veterinary societies and have as their mission the assembling	of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing	through the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural	history of various diseases of military-medical importance.	3.519047978101427
5498. the american	registry of pathology operates as a cooperative enterprise in	medical research and education between the armed forces institute of	pathology and the civilian medical profession on a national and international	basis under such conditions as may be agreed upon between	the national research council and the surgeons general of the army	navy and air force.	4.549494161879565
5499. the staff utilized the collected material	in these registries for numerous lectures to national and international	meetings exhibits and published studies.	3.7158312860167584
5500. during the period of this	report 37470 new cases were entered into the various registries.	6.812512854370839

5521. during fiscal years 1959 and 1960 there were 795586 visitors to the	museum.	5.572478670594446
5522. during the period from 1 july 1960 through 31 january	1961 the medical museum was required to move to temporary building	s on the mall from chase hall.	5.261523426296345
5523. throughout the period	and during the movement operation the museum continued its functional	support of the armed forces institute of pathology.	4.610229268109037
5524. medical publication agency	the armed forces medical publication	agency established in 1949 has published since january 1950	the united states armed forces medical journal as a triservice	publication	to furnish material of professional interest to medical department	officers of the three military services.	4.74064884469114
5525. its supplement the medical	technicians bulletin supplied similar material to enlisted	medical personnel.	4.944411120347637
5526. these publications replaced the u s naval	medical bulletin published continuously from 1907 through 1959 as	well as the navy's hospital corps quarterly and the bulletin of	the u s army medical department published from 1922 to 1949.	5.141952303410967
5527. in addition their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication	of a contemplated air force medical bulletin.	4.566888642089719
5528. estimated annual	savings resulting from publication of the journal and bulletin	on a triservice basis as compared with the cost of producing separate	periodicals for each service were between $65000 and $70000.	5.405091938554944
5529. additionally	on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations	the availability of the journal removed the necessity of subscribing	to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the	quantity now authorized in order to provide any reasonably comparable	coverage.	3.987388490367233
5530. from 1 july 1958 to 30 june 1960 24 numbers of	the	journal and nine of the bulletin were published.	5.875583065959151
5531. each journal contained	articles of professional and clinical interest and departments	devoted to military medical news reviews of new books and other features	of interest to officers of the medical services.	3.9337807439314827
5532. the council	on national defense of the american medical association contributed	a brief article to each issue entitled this is your ama.	5.709968099545632
5533. beginning with the october 1959 issue of the journal	the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction was	changed from varityping to hot typesetting.	3.914569699171236
5534. this resulted in an improved	appearance but was followed by an increase in printing cost that	necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total	of allocated funds.	5.725658282510482
5535. the use of 100 instead of 140 substance paper	plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the may 1960 issue	reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with	nearly $4000 in unexpended funds.	3.731258046672539
5536. two special issues were	published one for november 1959 on space medicine the other the	tenth anniversary issue for january 1960.	5.573443034137121
5537. the february 1960 issue	marked the reinstitution of the section entitled the medical officer	writes.	3.93777821379478
5538. replacing the discontinued medical technicians	bulletin	publication of which was suspended with the november-december	1959 issue a section called technical notes was inaugurated	on a bimonthly basis beginning with the april 1960 issue.	5.032024293167047
5539. occasional	features were published on historical medicine special reports bibliography	and collector's items.	4.535752126583474
5540. in may 1960 the armed	forces institute of pathology began a series of articles on the medical	museum and in june the institute started contributing	a regular monthly case for diagnosis.	5.502752028125733
5541. the institute also planned	to furnish a regular series of articles beginning in the fall	of 1960 on its more significant scientific exhibits.	3.6168511556908465
5542. the armed	forces epidemiological board agreed to submit each month a report	for one of its 12 commissions so that each commission will report	once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest	and value to medical officers of the armed forces.	4.892343811126889
5543. the first	report in this continuing series appeared in the september 1960 issue	of the journal.	4.290447041705321
5544. another recent achievement was the successful development of a method	for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine	when the product is relatively non-volatile.	5.013185019821809
5545. this work gave a heat	of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value	which had been determined by a less direct method and raises this	property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago.	3.7432225759710085
5546. similar measurements	are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the	heat of formation of another important combustion product beryllium fluoride.	5.306802021708014
5547. the development and testing of new apparatus to measure	other properties is nearing completion.	3.9374569952961833
5548. in one of these an exploding-wire	device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6000 f and	100 atmospheres pressure a major goal was achieved.	6.3136625786267695
5549. the accuracy of	measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during	a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison	with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2	percent.	3.374909738052478
5550. this agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals.	6.442246419515362
5551. the method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element	as a calorimeter.	4.453868181966725
5552. the element is inserted	in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire	and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy.	5.080191530335327
5553. this is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and	the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the	element and the measured voltage across the element.	4.039982419727331
5554. a high-speed	shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation	of any portion of the electrical wire explosion.	6.504796594327581
5555. the shutter consists	of two parts: a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part.	4.012715720819275
5556. using	edgerton's method the fast-closing action is obtained from the	blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires.	5.682358984033063
5557. the fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil	placed directly in front of the camera lens so that	no light may pass into the camera.	4.523989952467027
5558. the opening action is obtained	when a capacitor charged to high voltage is suddenly discharged through	the foil.	5.1813340789152145
5559. during the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the	passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward	its center line thus allowing light to pass into the camera.	3.895259869351364
5560. experiments	have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds.	5.7836982265615156
5561. the shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing	the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil.	3.6263069595579034
5562. besides	the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength the spectra of	extraterrestrial radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic	of other atoms ions and small molecules.	4.96038068518468
5563. the detection and study	of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on	interstellar gas clouds and perhaps planetary atmospheres.	3.6061566743622318
5564. among the	most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light	diatomic hydrides oh and ch; somewhat less likely sources	are the heavier hydrides sh sih and sch.	5.18254949947024
5565. very small	concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable; in interstellar	gas concentrations as low as f moleculesf may be sufficient	as compared to the f hydrogen atoms f required for detection of	the 21-cm line.	3.9111886197100874
5566. high sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved	by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver; therefore only with	precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical	search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible.	4.975876518692369
5567. to secure precise	measurements of these frequencies a research program in free radical	microwave spectroscopy has been started.	4.2865861276117085
5568. since conventional methods	are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions	the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead.	5.593100394250956
5569. this	involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor	which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave	range where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity.	3.9926444843406887
5570. the first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance	method was the oh radical.	6.045025091081321
5571. results of this experiment include	the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which oh may	be identified in interstellar gas; the frequencies are 1665.	3.992773030794978
5572. 36 f with an uncertainty of 0.	7.1581511048922275
5573. success in observing these	spectral lines has so far apparently been confined to the laboratory;	extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported.	4.1497396161992715
5574. preparations	are being made for similar experiments on ch and sh	radicals.	6.289010577019261
5575. the bureau is pursuing	an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration	services in the range 1.	4.018359308918941
5576. the efforts and accomplishments	fall into three main categories: absolute thermometry based	upon the velocity of sound in helium gas secondary thermometry involving	principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors and helium-4	vapor-pressure measurements.	4.734318265569195
5577. an acoustical interferometer has been constructed and	used with helium gas as the thermometric fluid to measure temperatures	near 4.	4.132656825642804
5578. such an interferometer provides a means of absolute	temperature measurement and may be used as an alternative to	the gas thermometer.	6.8069368453603945
5579. when values of temperature derived with this instrument	were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid	helium-4 vapor pressures differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively	were found.	3.9650824589954015
5580. this result is preliminary and work is continuing.	7.006468312365853
5581. carbon resistors and impurity-doped	germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary	thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region.	3.8880356915934375
5582. several	germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.	6.289010577019261
5583. 2 f and	their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 13 millidegree	when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer	whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium.	4.3234223220778665
5584. preliminary	calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4.	7.293115828511091
5585. 16	f at every 0.	6.683325264329536
5586. the estimated standard deviations of the data for	two of the resistors were  1 millidegree; and for the third resistor	3.	5.850364977310032
5587. the reproducibilities	of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated	in conjunction with a constant temperature liquid helium bath	from 4.	3.7179193381860367
5588. surface temperature gradients have been found to	exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15-and 25-liter metallic storage	dewars.	5.6322467430336385
5589. the gradient was about one half of a millidegree at 4.	4.746354758338703
5590. 2	f but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly	greater than the |l point.	5.659455227543579
5591. a hydrostatic head correction has	been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures	or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium.	3.7782646401868343
5592. however the surface	temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements	for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate	the tube	from the liquid helium surface.	5.519583110835459
5593. it has also been observed in helium	2 that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures	and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer.	4.275118314966933
5594. this	has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer.	6.103259258407421
5595. in this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified	pressure transducer for pvt	precise pressure-volume-temperature measurements on	corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer.	4.161925693265686
5596. a prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and	thoroughly tested.	6.2272542153453445
5597. the transducer is a null-type instrument and employs	a stretched diaphragm 0.	4.672888964162827
5598. 001 in thick and 1 in in diameter.	6.806723317680827
5599. a small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance	between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced	0.	4.033330859061411
5600. spherical concave backing surfaces	support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent	the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit.	5.051766433984403
5601. over a temperature range from 25 to 200 f and at pressures up to	250 atm an overload of 300 psi applied for a period of one day	results in an uncertainty in the pressure of at most one millimeter	of mercury.	3.814608306325715
5602. a 6-year study of the	transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed.	5.61618342048764
5603. this project was carried out under sponsorship of the ballistic	missile division of the air research and development command us	air force and had as its goal the investigation of the transport	by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding.	3.789648369275297
5604. a significant	effect discovered during the study is the existence of prandtl	numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation	region.	5.633085937730076
5605. another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal	diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature	differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present.	3.8701847702663192
5606. the results of the study based on collision integrals computed from	the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air	will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity thermal conductivity	thermal diffusion and diffusion coefficients at temperatures	of 1000 to 10000 f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from	f to f times normal density.	4.664162843815596
5607. in march 1961 representatives of the national laboratories	of australia canada the netherlands united kingdom ussr	united states and west germany met at the nbs	to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature	scale between 10 and 90 f.	3.8007809012122804
5608. as a first step toward this goal	arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through	circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers	for calibration by each national laboratory.	5.675036289636454
5609. such a group of thermometers	was obtained and calibrated at the nbs.	6.215396907845356
5610. these thermometers	have now been sent to the united kingdom for calibration at the national	physical laboratory.	7.268604040395596
5611. during the	last week of march 1961 columbus ohio was the site of the fourth	symposium on temperature its measurement and control in science	and industry.	4.328109853893732
5612. the symposium which was jointly sponsored by the	american institute of physics the instrument society of america	and the national bureau of standards attracted nearly one thousand	registrants including many from abroad.	4.570140842607308
5613. the bureau contributed	to the planning and success of the symposium through the efforts of mr	w a wildhack general chairman and dr c m	herzfeld program chairman.	3.969692316727787
5614. dr a v astin nbs	director opened the 5-day session with introductory remarks following	which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week	by nbs scientists from both the washington and boulder laboratories.	5.235794399890158

5653. mr speaker for several years now the commuter	railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly	difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population	wants and is entitled to have.	4.083210467539255
5654. the causes of the decline of the commuter	railroads are many and complex- high taxes losses of revenue to	government subsidized highway and air carriers to name but two.	5.094636707275386
5655. and	the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally	varied ranging all the way from government ownership to complete	discontinuance of this important service.	4.363084442707603
5656. there have been a number	of sound plans proposed.	10.924256967553434
5657. but none of these has been implemented.	6.377541340813658
5658. instead we have stood idly by watched our commuter railroad service	decline and have failed to offer a helping hand.	6.045554965719613
5659. though the number	of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased	tremendously since world war 2 total annual rail commutation	dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957.	4.402136693566461
5660. nowhere has this decline	been more painfully evident than in the new york city area.	9.300451605506172
5661. here the	new york central railroad one of the nation's most important	carriers has alone lost 47.	5.423415954303636
5662. 6 percent of its passengers since 1949.	7.292836855047981
5663. at this time of crisis in our nation's commuter railroads	a new threat to the continued operations of the new york central has	appeared in the form of the chesapeake + ohio railroad's proposal	for control of the baltimore + ohio railroads.	4.760085382114814
5664. the new york	central has pointed out that this control if approved by the interstate	commerce commission would give the combined c + o-b	+ o railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the	new york central.	5.159755605744863
5665. not only is this kind of duplication wasteful	but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic	away from the new york central and other railroads serving the area.	4.937448206638584
5666. the new york central notes:   the freight traffic	most susceptible to raiding by the c + o-b + o provides	the backbone of central's revenues.	5.55602421991183
5667. these revenues make it	possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire	new york central system as well as the new york area commuter	and terminal freight services.	4.538637197251901
5668. if these services are to be maintained	the new york central must have the revenues to make them possible.	6.835780732871735
5669. the new york central today handles 60 percent of all	southbound commuter traffic coming into new york city.	4.571854598156102
5670. this is a	$14 million operation involving 3500 employees who work on commuter	traffic exclusively.	6.593343553411476
5671. a blow to this phase of the central's operations	would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad	itself but to the 40000 people per day who are provided with efficient	reasonably priced transportation in and out of the city.	4.169573432380602
5672. there is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful	c + o-b + o merger scheme-   the central	has pointed out.	5.748371203372182
5673. the logic of creating a strong balanced	competitive two-system railroad service in the east is so obvious	that b + o was publicly committed to the approach outlined here.	3.729008506324665
5674. detailed studies of the plan were well underway.	7.559987823211436
5675. though	far from completion these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings	would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads	concerned their investors their customers their users and to the	public at large.	3.757265870534585
5676. then abandoning the studies in the face of	their promising outlook for all concerned b + o entered on-again-off-again	negotiations with c + o which resulted in the present	situation.	5.702773221716674
5677. in the light of the facts at hand however	new york central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create	a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure in the public interest.	4.248530020423631
5678. the interstate commerce commission will commence its	deliberations on the proposed c + o-b + o merger on	june 18.	4.975566181955082
5679. obviously the interstate commerce commission will not force	the new york central to further curtail its commuter operations	by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge.	3.885685917862653
5680. however there is a more profound consideration to this proposed	merger than profit and loss.	7.46844881755856
5681. that is will it serve the long-range	public interest?	6.2234890847364275
5682.    for the past 40 years congress has advocated	a carefully planned balanced and competitive railway system.	6.7955818440065086
5683. we must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter-	the two-way b + o-c + o merger or the three-way	new york central-b + o-c + o merger.	4.11388745958501
5684. which will	serve not only the best interest of the stockholders but the interests	of all the traveling public?	6.6076671441796515
5685. 	mr speaker i rise today to pay tribute to	a great newspaper the new york times on the occasion of a major change	in its top executive command.	4.006901785932672
5686. arthur hays sulzberger has	been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and	it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to american	journalism on the occasion of his retirement.	4.981905072110014
5687. i am pleased to	note that mr sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the	board of the new york times.	5.874404286686342
5688. mr sulzberger's successor	as publisher is mr orvil e dryfoos who is president of the	new york times co and who has been with the times since 1942.	5.624364539190045
5689. mr dryfoos' outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that	the high standards which have made the times one of the world's	great newspapers will be maintained.	4.508045794732717
5690. i am also pleased to note	that mr john b oakes a member of the times staff since 1946	has been appointed as editorial page editor.	6.182126040291078
5691. mr oakes succeeds	charles merz editor since 1938 who now becomes editor emeritus.	4.702911252395568
5692. i should like at this time mr speaker to pay warm tribute	to arthur hays sulzberger and charles merz on the occasion of	their retirement from distinguished careers in american journalism.	5.484380590800692
5693. my heartiest congratulations go to their successors orvil e	dryfoos and john b oakes who can be counted upon to sustain	the illustrious tradition of the new york times.	4.482166885975007
5694. the people	of the 17th district of new york and i as their representative	in congress take great pride in the new york times as one of the	great and authoritative newspapers of the world.	5.9897267167391295
5695. mr speaker in my latest newsletter to my constituents	i urged the imposition of a naval blockade of cuba as the	only effective method of preventing continued soviet armaments from	coming into the western hemisphere in violation of the monroe doctrine.	3.7250779678772674
5696. yesterday i had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article	in the us news + world report of may 8 which discussed this	type of action in more detail including both its advantages and its	disadvantages.	5.1277334195223565
5697. under leave to extend my remarks i include	the relevant portion of my newsletter together with the text of the	article from the us news + world report:	cuban ssr: whatever may have been the setbacks resulting	from the unsuccessful attempt of the cuban rebels to establish	a beachhead on the castro-held mainland last week there was at least	one positive benefit and that was the clear-cut revelation to the	whole world of the complete conversion of cuba into a russian-dominated	military base.	3.737277318319252
5698. in fact one of the major reasons for the	failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full	information on the extent to which cuba has been getting this russian	military equipment.	6.771364812431669
5699. somehow the pictures and stories of soviet	t-34 tanks on cuban beaches and russian mig jet fighters strafing	rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark blunt truth	of what it means to have a russian military base 90 miles away from	home.	3.827886254555698
5700. russian tanks and planes in cuba jeopardize the security of	the united states violate the monroe doctrine and threaten the	security of every other latin american republic.	5.267073078797078
5701. once the full	extent of this russian military penetration of cuba was clear president	kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate	to prevent this even if we had to go it alone.	3.968921863266659
5702. but the latin american	republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on	taking action against castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally	throwing cuba off the inter-american defense board.	5.257459993379999
5703. for years	the united states had been trying to get these countries to exclude	castro's representative from secret military talks.	4.561326013898137
5704. but it took the	pictures of the migs and the t-34 tanks to do the job.	7.12048814527632
5705. there	is a new atmosphere of urgency in washington this week.	5.920054902889157
5706. you can see	it for example in the extensive efforts president kennedy has made	to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both cuba	and laos; efforts	as i see it which are being directed by the way toward	support for future actions not for those already past.	5.390874928120475
5707. what	the next move will be only time of course will tell.	5.073411528086077
5708. personally	i think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of cuba.	6.569247234795995
5709. we	simply can't tolerate further russian weapons including the possibility	of long-range nuclear missiles being located in cuba.	4.060235568763422
5710. obviously	we can't stop them from coming in however just by talk.	6.219414537210514
5711. a naval	blockade would be thoroughly in line with the monroe doctrine would	be a relatively simple operation to carry out and would bring an	abrupt end to soviet penetration of our hemisphere.	3.693257476440513
5712. us news + world report may 8 1961	_next for cuba:	look at castro now- cockier than ever	with arms and agents to threaten the americas.	5.192825998012949
5713. how can the	united states act?	8.082841174579023
5714.    blockade is one answer offered by experts.	7.1581511048922275
5715. in it they see a way to isolate cuba stop infiltration maybe finish	castro too.	5.001660062847789
5716. this is the question now facing president	kennedy: how to put a stop to the soviet buildup in cuba and to	communist infiltration of this hemisphere?	5.875245734856225
5717.    on april 25 the	white house reported that a total embargo of remaining us	trade with cuba was being considered.	4.3542381505058545
5718. its aim: to undermine further	cuba's economy.	8.654342358261424
5719. another strategy- bolder	and tougher- was also attracting notice in washington: a naval	and air blockade to cut cuba off from the world destroy castro.	3.952255470197579
5720. blockade in the view of military and civilian experts could restore	teeth to the monroe doctrine.	6.094729016778342
5721. it could halt a flood of communist	arms and strategic supplies now reaching castro.	5.164777382756333
5722. it could stop	cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to south america.	7.029332926506733
5723. it would be the most severe reprisal short of declared war that the	united states could invoke against castro.	5.368695249588232
5724. it is the strategy	of blockade therefore that is suddenly at the center of attention	of administration officials members of congress officers in the	pentagon.	6.462361867627941
5725. as a possible course of action it also is the center of	what	would	military experts say a tight naval blockade	off cuban ports and at the approaches to cuban waters would require	two naval task forces each built around an aircraft carrier with	a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers.	3.6673191543409445
5726. the	navy on april 25 announced it is bringing back the carrier shangri-la	from the mediterranean increasing to four the number of	attack carriers in the vicinity of cuba.	4.958656631333854
5727. more than 36 other big navy	ships are no less than a day's sailing time away.	5.483655762326497
5728. to round	out the blockading force submarines would be needed- to locate identify	and track approaching vessels.	5.877196148775364
5729. land-based radar would help with	this task.	5.66037853959279
5730. so would radar picket ships.	9.641524200014828
5731. a squadron of navy jets and	another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier	task forces.	4.193895521801091
5732. three requirements go with a blockade: it must	be proclaimed; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce	it; and it must be enforced without discrimination.	5.56886862530812
5733. once	these conditions of international law are met countries that try to	run to blockade do so at their own risk.	3.981068217472997
5734. blockade runners can be stopped-	by gunfire if necessary- searched and held at least temporarily.	5.659455227543579
5735. they could be sent to us ports for rulings whether cargo	should be confiscated.	5.298768344331572
5736. in a broad sense it would reaffirm the monroe	doctrine by opposing communist interference in the western hemisphere.	6.369820035865235
5737. it could by avoiding direct intervention provide a short-of-war	strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration.	5.055391532282332
5738. primary target	would be shipments of tanks guns aviation gasoline and ammunition	coming from russia and czechoslovakia.	5.593935679417225
5739. shipments of arms from western	countries could similarly be seized as contraband.	4.535752126583474
5740. in a total blockade	action could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals	oils textiles and even foodstuffs.	6.180036876645937
5741. at times three ships a day from	the soviet bloc are unloading in cuban ports.	4.871378552410223
5742. from its inception in 1920 with the passage of public law 236 66th	congress the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been	to assist the states by means of grants-in-aid to return disabled	men and women to productive gainful employment.	5.5717798019747065
5743. the authority for	the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation	program was made permanent as title 5 of the social security	act in 1935.	3.666172677054029
5744. up to this time and for the next eight years the services	provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training counseling	and placement on a job.	6.508670905540949
5745. recognizing the limitations of such a program	the 78th congress in 1943 passed p l 113 which broadened	the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical	restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities and which revised	the financing structure.	3.726705344794314
5746. despite the successful	rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first	eleven years after 1943 the existing program was still seen to be	inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of an estimated two million	disabled.	5.317136674808195
5747. to assist the states therefore in rehabilitating handicapped	individuals so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative	employment to the extent of their capabilities the 83rd	congress enacted the vocational rehabilitation amendments of 1954	.	4.072205585695871
5748. these amendments to the vocational rehabilitation	act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation	facilities for more sheltered and half-way workshops for	greater numbers of adequately trained personnel for more comprehensive	services to individuals	and for other administrative improvements to increase the program's	overall effectiveness.	4.814199429011714
5749. under the law as it	existed until 1943 the federal government made grants to the states	on the basis of population matching state expenditures on a 50-50	basis.	4.529891382870587
5750. under p l 113 78th congress the federal government	assumed responsibility for 100% of necessary state expenditures	in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of	the disabled and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing clients	with rehabilitation case services.	4.835957566104889
5751. throughout these years the statutory	authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out	the provisions of the act.	4.265676394216654
5752. the 1954 amendments completely changed	the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program providing	for a three-part grant structure- for extension	and improvement; and research demonstrations training and	traineeships for vocational rehabilitation- and in addition for	short-term training and instruction.	4.660089103703532
5753. the first part of the new structure-	that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation	services- is described in this section.	4.931384366976228
5754. subsequent sections	on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure.	6.2751130594554105
5755. the following table shows for selected years the authorizations	appropriations allotment base federal grants to states and state	matching funds for this part of the grant program:	distributing funds	in order to assist	the states in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services section	2 of the amended act provides that allotments to states for	support of such services be based on need as measured by a state's	population and fiscal capacity as measured by its per capita	income.	3.5285923317519687
5756. the act further provides for a floor or minimum allotment	set at the 1954 level which is called the base allotment	and a ceiling or maximum allotment for each state.	4.672700157316812
5757. it stipulates	in addition that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing	the ceiling	and not used for insuring the floor be redistributed	to those states still below their maximums.	4.23706197541634
5758. these provisions	are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among	the states with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person	have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in	a state with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly	populated state.	4.667606335251819
5759. the provisions are also designed to avoid disruption	in state programs already in operation which might otherwise result	from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population	alone.	3.671635130618311
5760. the method used in computing	the allotments is specifically set forth in the act.	5.784423494453648
5761. the term	state means the several states the district of columbia the	virgin islands guam and puerto rico; the term united states	includes the several states and the district of columbia and	excludes the virgin islands guam and puerto rico and prior	to	1962 alaska and hawaii.	3.347962154616233
5762. the following steps are employed in calculations:	for each state	determine	average per capita income based on the last three years.	6.104627890705403
5763. determine the average per capita income for the u s	based on the last three years.	4.485430147163133
5764. determine	the ratio of 50% to the average per capita income of the u s	determine	for each state	that percentage which	bears the same ratio to 50% as the particular state's average per	capita income bears to the average per capita income of the u s.	4.922062087769364
5765. determine the particular	state's allotment percentage.	6.164878650227995
5766. by law this is 75% for	the virgin islands guam and puerto rico.	6.426204511144302
5767. in all other states it is the difference obtained by subtracting	from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above; except that no	state shall have an allotment percentage less than 33-13% nor more	than 75%.	4.02769349805995
5768. if the resulting difference for the particular state is	less or more than these extremes the state's allotment percentage	must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme.	5.162144323761586
5769. square	each state's allotment percentage.	6.683325264329536
5770. multiply the population of each	state by the square of its allotment percentage.	6.403675329698039
5771. determine the sum of the products obtained in item 8 above for all the	states.	4.845873090098352
5772. 1 to 8 above and then add the results obtained for each state in item	determine the ratio that the amount being allotted	is to the sum of the products for all the states.	5.660247896378825
5773. determine	the particular state's unadjusted allotment for the particular	fiscal year.	4.855658467968249
5774. determine if the particular	state's unadjusted allotment	is greater than its maximum allotment and if so lower its unadjusted	allotment to its maximum allotment.	5.138879457587037
5775. for any fiscal year which exceeds its minimum allotment described	in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and one-half times	the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $23000000	determine if	the particular state's unadjusted allotment	is less than its minimum allotment and if so raise	its unadjusted	allotment to its minimum allotment.	3.4466251713394036
5776. regardless of its unadjusted	allotment each state is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment	each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954-	increased by a uniform percentage of 5.	5.177253764012838
5777. 4865771 which brings total	1954 allotments to all states up to $23000000.	4.535752126583474
5778. the funds	recouped by reductions in item 12 above are used: first to increase	the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those states	where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment	; and second to increase uniformly the allotments to those	states whose allotments are below their maximums with adjustments	to prevent the allotment of any state from thereby exceeding its maximum.	4.354120474313642
5779. for the states which maintain	two separate agencies- one for the vocational rehabilitation of	the blind and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the	blind- the act specifies that their minimum allotment shall	be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided	in fiscal year 1954.	4.200917426564661
5780. funds allotted in addition to their minimum	allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine.	6.012679051763633
5781. as	is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational	rehabilitation services the matching requirements are also based on	a statutory formula.	4.046276352241739
5782. prior to 1960 in order to provide matching for	the minimum allotment state funds had to equal 1954 state funds.	6.155801410307382
5783. prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched	at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the state with a pivot	of 40% state participation in total program	costs.	4.591966009645818
5784. the percentage of federal participation in such costs for any	state is referred to in the law as that state's federal share.	5.464920095699884
5785. for purposes of this explanation this percentage is referred to	as the states unadjusted federal share.	4.363731156716682
5786. beginning in 1960 the	matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted	25% a year so that by 1963 the entire	support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40% pivot state	share with maximum and minimum state shares of 50% and 30% respectively.	4.797320358452046
5787. the pre-1960 rate of federal participation with respect	to any state's base allotment as well as the adjusted rate in effect	during the 1960-1962 period is designated by the statute as that	state's adjusted federal share.	3.7229595739774726
5788. the provisions for determining	a state's unadjusted federal share are designed to reflect the	varying financial resources among the states.	5.317067806687842
5789. the purpose of the adjusted	federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition	provisions	for reaching the unadjusted federal share is to prevent	method of computing	the method used for computing the respective	federal and state shares in total program costs is specifically set	forth in the act.	3.624822300775783
5790. the term state means the several states	the district of columbia the virgin islands guam and puerto rico;	the term united states includes the several states and	the district of columbia and excludes the virgin islands guam	and puerto rico and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii.	4.406815950909704
5791. the following	steps are employed in the calculations:  for each state	determine the average per capita income for	the last three years.	3.6398110151839265
5792. determine the average	per capita income for the united states for the last three years.	8.060279026941007
5793. same amount used in item 2 under method of computing allotments	determine the ratio of 40% to the average per	capita income of the united states.	4.2019385466778285
5794. determine for each state		that percentage which bears the same ration to 40% as the particular	state's average per capita income bears to the average per	capita income of the united states.	5.298382358735326
5795. determine the particular state's federal share.	5.719496226753721
5796. by	law this is 70% for the virgin islands guam and puerto rico.	5.926734816808145
5797. in all other states it is the difference	obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4	above; except	that no state shall have a federal share less than	50% nor more than 70%.	4.064266455627335
5798. if the resulting difference for the particular	state is less or more than these extremes the state's federal	share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme.	5.162144323761586
5799. at the entrance side of the shelter each roof beam is rested	on the inside 4 inches of the block wall.	4.742349508382915
5800. the outside 4-inch space is	filled by mortaring blocks on edge.	5.84279444232532
5801. the wooden bracing between the roof	beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall.	4.367543283959748
5802. mortar is poured	between this bracing and the 4-inch blocks on edge to complete the	wall thickness for radiation shielding.	5.2920541105344485
5803. the first one or two roof boards	are slipped into place across the roof beams from outside	the shelter.	4.566934253771491
5804. these boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up	through the open space between the beams from inside the shelter.	5.608615060826799
5805. concrete	blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards.	4.672293985277969
5806. the	roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together.	6.320401143794262
5807. work on the roof continues in this way.	6.814625552236305
5808. the last roof boards are covered	with blocks from outside the shelter.	6.243753037324464
5809. when the roof blocks	are all in place the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position.	4.4007736107941104
5810. building plans are	on page 21.	8.18656221502958
5811. solid concrete blocks relatively heavy and dense	are used for this shelter.	4.5772009238521525
5812. these blocks are sold in various sizes	so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit.	5.893993680214637
5813. solid blocks	are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete	to give effective protection.	5.253961997696893
5814. if they are used the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give	the same protection as the 8-inch solid concrete blocks.	6.270519897400499
5815. the	illustrations in fig 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall.	4.533915202544028
5816. more	detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply	houses and craftsmen.	5.926734816808145
5817. other sources of information include the national	concrete masonry association 38 south dearborn street	chicago ill the portland cement association 33 west grand	avenue chicago ill and the structural clay products association	washington dc.	3.678493856588229
5818. an outdoor aboveground fallout shelter also may be built with concrete	blocks.	6.76411655222878
5819. most people would	have to hire a contractor to build this shelter.	5.219622668085452
5820. plans are on pages	22 and 23.	7.603896187885215
5821. this shelter could be built in regions where water	or rock is close to the surface making it impractical to build an underground	shelter.	4.399030189983682
5822. two walls of concrete blocks are constructed	at least 20 inches apart.	6.731068866206824
5823. the space between them is filled with pit-run	gravel or earth.	4.200642402803407
5824. the walls are held together with metal ties placed	in the wet mortar as the walls are built.	5.1881765781962415
5825. the roof shown here	is a 6-inch slab of reinforced concrete covered with at	least 20 inches of pit-run gravel.	3.83490493138768
5826. an alternate roof perhaps more	within do-it-yourself reach could be constructed of heavy wooden roof	beams overlaid with boards and waterproofing.	5.467799144073903
5827. it would have to be covered	with at least 28 inches of pit-run gravel.	6.845064249203307
5828. the materials	for a double-wall shelter would cost about $700.	5.804273692121158
5829. contractors' charges	would be additional.	6.683325264329536
5830. the shelter would provide almost absolute fallout	protection.	6.235817153065196
5831. pre-shaped corrugated	metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either	above or below ground.	4.945667188797039
5832. these are particularly suitable for regions where	water or rock is close to the surface.	7.460090930375179
5833. they form effective fallout	shelters when mounded over with earth as shown in figure 10.	4.807041460138321
5834. materials for this shelter would cost about $700.	6.806723317680827
5835. a contractor probably	would be required to help build it.	4.997344463675742
5836. his charges would be added to	the cost of materials.	6.785689629671467
5837. this shelter as shown on page 24 would provide	almost absolute protection from fallout radiation.	4.294948575713688
5838. an alternate	hatchway entrance shown on page 25 would reduce the cost of materials	$50 to $100.	6.593741884840834
5839. the national lumber manufacturers association	washington d c is developing plans to utilize specially	treated lumber for underground shelter construction.	3.8981360734287707
5840. the structural	clay products institute washington dc is working to develop	underground	an underground reinforced concrete shelter	can be built by a contractor for about $1000 to $1500 depending	on the type of entrance.	4.904895951000847
5841. the shelter shown would provide almost absolute	fallout protection.	4.465110340486763
5842. the illustration shows this	shelter with the roof at ground level and mounded over.	5.289832921804139
5843. the same shelter	could be built into an embankment or below ground level.	4.493822854468988
5844. plans	for the shelter with either a stairway or hatchway entrance are shown	on pages 26 and 27.	5.454336586728915
5845. another type of shelter which gives excellent	fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement	of a home under construction.	4.1642736421601105
5846. it would add about $500 to the total	cost of the home.	7.402967253644197
5847. the shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such	a room built in a new home in the washington dc area in the	spring of 1959.	4.452096239670609
5848. common	to each type of shelter are:  arrangement of the entrance.	6.555844426814421
5849. must have at least one right-angle turn.	7.462746605684684
5850. radiation scatters somewhat like light.	8.18656221502958
5851. some will go around a corner.	6.293668596807881
5852. the rest continues in a straight line.	6.581094261964447
5853. therefore sharp turns	in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter.	4.589122272160104
5854. is provided in a concrete block basement	shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance.	6.8963304960467005
5855. a blower	may be installed to increase comfort.	5.262057547315881
5856. a blower is essential	for the double-wall shelter and for the underground shelters.	6.72954048972465
5857. it should	provide not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person.	5.067935755378139
5858. vent	pipes also are necessary but	filters are not.	7.1581511048922275
5859. is cut down by the	shielding necessary to keep out radiation.	5.404029721244492
5860. as soon as the shelter is	completed a radio reception check must be made.	7.290942898677522
5861. it probably will be	necessary to install an outside antenna particularly to receive conelrad	broadcasts.	4.726305979836047
5862. continuous low-level lighting may be provided in the	shelter by means of a 4-cell hot-shot battery to which is wired a 150-milliampere	flashlight-type bulb.	5.672335999579123
5863. tests have shown that such a device	with a fresh battery will furnish light continuously for at least	10 days.	4.105101166643833
5864. with a spare battery a source of light for 2 weeks or more	would be assured.	7.082227532245638
5865. a flashlight or electric lantern also should be available	for those periods when a brighter light is needed.	4.074510095137242
5866. there should	be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue	in many areas.	6.313254882075212
5867. if there	are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter	they should be shielded as shown in the appendix page 29.	4.393490993180364
5868. other basement	windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens.	7.206831724040867
5869. basement	walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the	appendix page 29.	4.483280591344156
5870. in these shelters the entrance should be	not more than 2 feet wide.	6.7034825623291985
5871. bunks or materials to build them may have	to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed.	3.943284457006815
5872. the basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado	or hurricane protection.	5.390469406701435
5873. the	radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first.	5.3285636594893
5874. forty-nine hours	after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent	of what it was an hour after the explosion.	5.496788110212745
5875. but the radiation may	be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous.	4.765605742694594
5876. therefore civil defense instructions received over conelrad	or by other means should be followed.	6.164819032320005
5877. a battery-powered	radio is essential.	6.568898791992302
5878. radiation instruments suitable for home use are	available and would be of value in locating that portion of the home	which offers the best protection against fallout radiation.	5.523213835854433
5879. there is	a possibility that battery-powered radios with built-in radiation meters	may become available.	5.181402740345072

5919. a belowground	basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside	level.	4.535919135532883

5921. if there is time after the warning	the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking	windows with bricks dirt books magazines or other heavy material.	4.263629795056174
5922. large apartment buildings	of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual	family dwellings.	5.708240189006601
5923. in general such apartments afford more protection	than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is	more space.	4.300037659051936
5924. the central area of the ground floor of a heavily	constructed apartment building with concrete floors should provide	more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling.	5.429606649410663
5925. the basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural	protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended	for the basement of a family dwelling.	3.775986097896453
5926. the federal	government is aiding local governments in several places to survey residential	commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout	protection they would provide and for how many people.	4.814841894185875
5927. the	problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use	of existing space.	4.57758384713112
5928. such planning will require the cooperation of other	occupants and of the apartment management.	7.391050465067302
5929. a former du pont official became a general motors vice president	and set about maximizing du pont's share of the general motors	market.	4.337631272894582
5930. lines of communications were established between the two	companies and several du pont products were actively promoted.	5.500517242345147
5931. within	a few years various du pont manufactured items were filling the entire	requirements of from four to seven of general motors' eight operating	divisions.	3.870467454600242
5932. the fisher body division long controlled by the	fisher brothers under a voting trust even though general motors owned	a majority of its stock followed an independent course for many years	but by 1947 and 1948 resistance had collapsed and its purchases	from du pont compared favorably with purchases by other general	motors divisions.	4.349922034968313
5933. competitors came to receive higher percentage	of general motors business in later years but it is likely	that this trend stemmed at least in part from the needs of general	motors outstripping du pont's capacity.	4.335256654731455
5934. the fact	that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du pont's	production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements	of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to du pont	by a stock interest.	5.132027254830764
5935. the inference is overwhelming that du pont's	commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained	solely on competitive merit.	3.7726701856862173
5936. 353 u s at 605.	8.18656221502958
5937. this court agreed with the trial court that considerations of price	quality and service were not overlooked by either du pont or general	motors.	3.8110967500434594
5938. 353 u s at 606.	8.18656221502958
5939. however it determined that	neither this factor nor the fact that all concerned in high executive	posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly each in the	honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own	company and without any design to overreach anyone including du pont's	competitors 353 u s at 607 outweighed the government's	claim for relief.	3.8161017384829305
5940. this claim as submitted to the district	court and dismissed by it 126 fsupp235 alleged violation	not only of  7 of the clayton act but also of   1 and 2 of	the sherman act.	5.013549696049522
5941. the latter provisions proscribe any contract combination	or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade and	monopolization of or attempts combinations or conspiracies to monopolize	such trade.	3.7060676179447003
5942. however this court put to one side without consideration	the government's appeal from the dismissal of its sherman	act allegations.	6.236971111637127
5943. it rested its decision solely on  7 which reads	in pertinent part:   no corporation engaged in commerce	shall acquire directly or indirectly the whole or any part of	the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in	commerce where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially	lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired	and the corporation making the acquisition or to restrain such commerce	in any section or community or tend to create a monopoly of any	line of commerce.	3.3572824365019867
5944. this section shall not apply to corporations	purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same	by voting or otherwise to bring about or in attempting to bring about	the substantial lessening of competition h.	4.812458978076424
5945. the purpose	of this provision was thus explained in the court's opinion:	section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only	the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation	of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation	but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies	in a relevant market which as a reasonable probability appear at the	time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation	of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation.	3.5097471661804125
5946. the section	is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies or the substantial	lessening of competition have occurred or are intended h.	5.167889570828118
5947. 353 u s at 589.	6.094118058689911
5948. thus a finding of conspiracy to	restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the court's	decision.	6.007332993062837
5949. indeed as already noted the court proceeded on the assumption	that the executives involved in the dealings between du pont	and general motors acted honorably and fairly and exercised	their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests	of their own companies.	3.6423539512343
5950. this however did not bar finding that du	pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and	finishes to general motors; that these products constituted a line	of commerce within the meaning of the clayton act; that general	motors' share of the market for these products was substantial;	and that competition for this share of the market was endangered	by the financial relationship between the two concerns:   the	statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered	when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition	of his customer's stock likely to have the effects condemned	by the statute.	4.858382283586592
5951. we repeat that the test of a violation of  7 is	whether at the time of suit there is a reasonable probability that	the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints.	4.768318681242775
5952. the	conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved	as to this acquisition h.	5.609866851460979
5953. 353 u s at 607.	6.094118058689911
5954. on	the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion the court remanded	the case to the district court to determine the appropriate	relief.	6.232264298973287
5955. the sole guidance given the court for discharging the task committed	to it was this:   the judgment must therefore be reversed	and the cause remanded to the district court for a determination	after further hearing of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate	in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition	offensive to the statute.	3.3115144812104393
5956. the district courts in the framing	of equitable decrees are clothed 'with large discretion to model	their judgments to fit the exigencies of the particular case'.	4.854705421889624
5957. international	salt co	v united states 332 u s 392	400-401.	5.066959048406199
5958. 353 u s at 607-608.	8.18656221502958
5959. this brings us to the	course of the proceedings in the district court.	5.257893592068643
5960. this	court's judgment was filed in the district court on july 18	1957.	6.579430109969745
5961. the first pretrial conference- held to appoint amici curiae	to represent the interest of the stockholders of du pont and general	motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent	hearings- took place on september 25 1957.	3.6742561253222483
5962. at the outset the	government's spokesman explained that counsel for the government	and for du pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view	to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court.	5.18974990679629
5963. du pont he said had proposed disenfranchisement of its general	motors stock along with other restrictions on the du pont-general	motors relationship.	3.993196949169283
5964. the government deeming these suggestions inadequate	had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du pont's	shares of general motors.	5.331201778907832
5965. counsel for the government invited	du pont's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program	but stated that if the court desired or if counsel for du pont	thought further discussion would not be profitable the government	was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days.	3.7719655997277117
5966. counsel for	du pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by	both sides at an early date.	5.545724359929214
5967. no previous antitrust case he said had	involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems	of relief.	4.267448096197025
5968. the submission of detailed plans would place the issues	before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture	or disenfranchisement in the abstract.	4.765382730065078
5969. the court adopted this procedure	with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out.	4.253623840991296
5970. the	government submitted its proposed decree on october 25 1957.	6.522871687113793
5971. the	plan called for divestiture by du pont of its 63000000 shares of general	motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders	as a dividend over a period of ten years.	3.7564296214699735
5972. christiana securities company	and delaware realty + investment company major stockholders	in du pont and the stockholders of delaware were dealt with specially	by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee again over	a ten-year period of du pont's general motors stock allocable to	them as well as any general motors stock which christiana and delaware	owned outright.	4.646273905296105
5973. if in the trustee's judgment reasonable	market conditions did not prevail during any given year he was to	be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the	ten-year period.	3.891855077511628
5974. in addition the right to vote the general motors	stock held by du pont was to be vested in du pont's stockholders	other than christiana and delaware and the stockholders of delaware;	du pont christiana and delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring	stock in or exercising control over general motors; du pont	christiana and delaware were to be prohibited to have any director	or officer in common with general motors and vice versa; and	general motors and du pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement	that provided for the purchase by general motors of any specified	percentage of its requirements of any du pont manufactured product	or for the grant of exclusive patent rights or for a grant by general	motors to du pont of a preferential right to make or sell any	chemical discovery of general motors or for the maintenance of any	joint commercial enterprise by the two companies.	4.652318978545477
5975. on motion of	the amici	curiae the court directed that a ruling be obtained from	the commissioner of internal revenue as to the federal income tax	consequences of the government's plan.	4.157546366713634
5976. on may 9 1958 the commissioner	announced his rulings.	8.407076258129385
5977. the annual dividends paid to du pont	stockholders in shares of general motors stock would be taxable as ordinary	income to the extent of du pont's earnings and profits.	3.7199327550983288
5978. the	measure for federal income tax purposes of the dividend to individual	stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time	of each annual distribution.	5.700057332500061
5979. in the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders	the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value	of the shares or du pont's tax basis for them which is approximately	$2.	4.232464159802893
5980. the forced sale of the general motors stock owned	by or allocable to christiana delaware and the stockholders of	delaware and deposited with the trustee would result in a tax to those	parties at the capital gains rate.	4.723263736269264
5981. du pont's counterproposal	was filed on may 14 1958.	5.066959048406199
5982. under its plan du pont would retain	its general motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders	the right to vote those shares.	5.536682967076934
5983. christiana and delaware would	in turn be required to pass on the voting rights to the general motors	shares allocable to them to their own stockholders.	4.325640112478854
5984. du pont would	be enjoined from having as a director officer or employee anyone	who was simultaneously an officer or employee of general motors and	no director officer or employee of du pont could serve as a director	of general motors without court approval.	4.744471660540129
5985. du pont would be denied	the right to acquire any additional general motors stock except	through general motors' distributions of stock or subscription rights	to its stockholders.	3.713770034454509
5986. on june 6 1958 general motors submitted	its objections to the government's proposal.	6.783169957941411
5987. it argued inter	alia that a divestiture order would severely depress the market	value of the stock of both general motors and du pont with consequent	serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent	investors among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions;	that there would be a similar decline in the market values of	other automotive and chemical stocks with similar losses to the stockholders	of those companies; that the tremendous volume of general	motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts	of general motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise	equity capital; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect	on the entire stock market and on general business activity.	3.4626122143288294
5988. general	motors comprehensively contended that the government plan would	not be in the public interest as required by the mandate of this	court.	6.047158226879976
5989. the decrees proposed by the amici curiae were filed	in august of 1958.	4.012715720819275
5990. these plans like du pont's contained provisions	for passing the vote on du pont's general motors shares on	to the ultimate stockholders of du pont christiana and delaware	except that officers and directors of the three companies their spouses	and other people living in their households as well as other specified	persons were to be totally disenfranchised.	5.178289702146338
5991. both plans also prohibited	common directors officers or employees between du pont christiana	and delaware on the one hand and general motors on the	other.	4.433268274893662
5992. it is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude unnourished by sense	to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such	a risk or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger	the confidentiality of the marriage relationship.	5.65252372581404
5993. while it is easy	enough to ridicule hawkins' pronouncement in pleas of the crown	from a metaphysical point of view the concept of the oneness	of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between	husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be	regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage.	3.8937958747930344
5994. by	making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which	congress has afforded to the marriage relationship the court today	continues in the path charted by the recent decision in wyatt	v united states 362 us 525 where the court held that	under the circumstances of that case a wife could be compelled to	testify against her husband over her objection.	4.53562165491199
5995. one need not waver in	his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other	things in american life which are also of great importance and to which	even law enforcement must accommodate itself.	3.8577339189637097
5996. one of these is the	solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage.	8.359485442124688
5997. the court's	opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine	does not in fact protect this relationship and that hence the doctrine	enthrones an unreality into a rule of law.	3.4363117066526185
5998. i am not	easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries	can be so lightly dismissed.	6.130138237631326
5999. but in any event i submit that	the power to depose belongs to congress not to this court.	4.7380760038166345

6018. he claimed 4-d classification as a minister of religion	devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching.	6.027653095935526
6019. on november	13 1952 he was classified in class 1-a.	5.845184472862463
6020. on november 22	1952 he wrote the board protesting this classification.	7.837385430523038
6021. he again stated	that he was a regular minister; that he was devoting	an average	of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly in addition to	50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties and that he opposed war in	any form.	3.988750692919443
6022. thereafter he was classified 1-o.	8.784620709559364
6023. on april 1 1953	after some six months of full-time pioneering petitioner discontinued	devoting 100 hours a month to preaching but failed to so	notify his local board.	4.02344597976867
6024. in a periodic review the local board on july	30 1953 reclassified him 1-a and upheld this classification	after a personal appearance by petitioner because of his willingness	to kill in defense of his church and home.	5.391907729201765
6025. upon administrative approval	of the reclassification he was ordered to report for induction on	june 11 1956 but failed to do so.	4.299420639580393
6026. he was not prosecuted however	and his case was subsequently reopened in the light of sicurella	v united states 348 us 385.	6.485034855640551
6027. he was again	reclassified 1-a by the local board.	5.857838793606712
6028. there followed a customary	department of justice hearing at which petitioner appeared.	7.266374309807031
6029. in	his report to the attorney general the hearing officer suggested that	the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service.	4.100680128095886
6030. on march 21 1957 however the department recommended approval of	the 1-a classification.	7.017654267018555
6031. its ground for this recommendation was	that while petitioner claimed before the local board august 17 1956	that he	was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching the headquarters	of the jehovah's witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so	and on the contrary had relinquished both his pioneer and bible	student servant positions.	3.6877328700500738
6032. it reported that he now devoted only some	6-12 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per	month to church activities.	5.502269476747234
6033. his claim was therefore so highly exaggerated	the department concluded that it cast doubt upon his	veracity and consequently upon his sincerity and good faith.	3.8871364131460804
6034. the	appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation.	7.044794725443932
6035. in	his answer thereto he advised the board that he had made no such statement	in 1956 and asserted that his only claim to pioneering	was in 1952.	4.148428677359658
6036. the appeal board however unanimously concurred in the	department's recommendation.	5.986278812405151
6037. upon return of the file to the local	board petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this	prosecution followed his failure to do so.	4.281351419779694
6038. petitioner first contends	that the department denied him procedural due process by not giving	him timely opportunity before its final recommendation to the appeal	board to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim	of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching.	5.078654671633888
6039. but the statement of the	local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file.	4.758605404461791
6040. he	admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times and he could have	rebutted it before the hearing officer.	6.039746964985402
6041. this he failed to do asserting	that he did not know it to be in his file.	6.717955016159484
6042. apparently he never	took the trouble to find out.	7.813772383614806
6043. nevertheless he had ample opportunity	to contest the statement before the appeal board.	4.853931342455543
6044. after the recommendation	of the department is forwarded to the appeal board that is the	appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial.	6.027759355156761
6045. we found in gonzales v united states supra that this	was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be	furnished a registrant.	4.090370086784502
6046. we said there that it was necessary that	a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut the department's	recommendation when it comes to the appeal board the agency with the	ultimate responsibility for classification.	5.918151463013703
6047. we fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner's	contention which was considered by the appeal board and	denied by it.	4.2280601511457645
6048. as was said in gonzales it is the appeal board	which renders the selective service determination considered 'final'	in the courts not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact.	6.223956209850682
6049. estep v united states 327 us 114.	5.3285636594893
6050. 348	u	s at 412-413.	10.109203984689895
6051. but there are other contentions which might	be considered more difficult.	6.631628366943329
6052. at his trial petitioner sought to secure	through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes of the department's	hearing officer evensen as well as his report thereon.	5.9373574457714
6053. petitioner	also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original federal	bureau of investigation reports to the department of justice.	4.840041070707386
6054. he alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld; nor	did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the federal bureau of	investigation reports might disclose.	5.297404087658622
6055. section 6 of the	act	as we have held does require the department's recommendation to	be placed in a registrant's file.	4.074301706759351
6056. gonzales v united states	supra.	8.978076491592427
6057. but there is nothing in the act requiring the hearing	officer's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant.	5.405566451552143
6058. while	the regulations formerly required that the hearing officer's report	be placed in the registrant's file this requirement was eliminated	in 1952.	5.659388860470662
6059. moreover the hearing officer's report is but intradepartmental	is directed to the attorney general and of course is not	the recommendation of the department.	4.650626337757436
6060. it is not essentially different	from a memorandum of an attorney in the department of justice of	which the attorney general receives many and to which he may give	his approval or rejection.	5.904821903214464
6061. it is but part of the whole process within	the department that goes into the making of the final recommendation	to the appeal board.	5.2358047040097215
6062. it is also significant that neither this	report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal	board.	6.105042384548764
6063. hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only	conclusions of the department on file with the board.	4.435300799726281
6064. petitioner	knew that the department's recommendation was based not on the hearing	officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his	file.	5.91550600723518
6065. having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local	board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board petitioner	cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed.	4.029812262766781
6066. it appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the	production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial.	5.724934411323171
6067. in addition petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the	report and notes.	5.100553226994082
6068. while there are now allegations of the withholding	of favorable evidence developed at the hearing and a denial of	a full and fair hearing no such claim was made by petitioner at	any stage of the administrative process.	5.234583702590621
6069. moreover his testimony at	trial never developed any such facts.	5.550554791318084
6070. in the light of these circumstances	as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered	entirely on the department's recommendation which petitioner	repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found	supported by the record we find no relevancy in the hearing officer's	report and notes.	5.500720667220102
6071. finally petitioner says that he was entitled	to inspect the fbi report during the proceedings before the	hearing officer as well as at the trial.	4.947680305512093
6072. he did receive a resume of	it- the same that was furnished the appeal board- and he made no	claim of its inaccuracy.	5.809616916774567
6073. even now no such claim is asserted.	6.2572638365135
6074. he bases	his present contention on the general right to explore indicating that	he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume.	5.508728503344085
6075. but this is fully	answered by united states v nugent supra.	5.953388598319098
6076. there we held	that the statutory scheme for review within the selective service	system h entitles conscientious objectors to no guarantee	that	the fbi reports must be produced for their inspection.	5.245808507661898
6077. even if we were not bound by nugent petitioner	here would not be entitled to the report.	5.557067089763978
6078. the recommendation of	the department- as well as the decision of the appeal board- was	based entirely on the local board file not on an fbi report.	5.659528150158568
6079. with this enlarged role in	mind i should like to make a few suggestions: what we in the united	states do or do not do will make a very large difference in what	happens in the rest of the world.	4.637786377000858
6080. we in this department must think about	foreign policy in its total context.	6.765111983205103
6081. we cannot regard foreign policy	as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal	policy has been extracted.	4.251623799514793
6082. foreign policy is the total involvement	of the american people with peoples and governments abroad.	6.6226260105895065
6083. that	means that if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership we must	think in terms of the total context of our situation.	5.387858089593633
6084. it is the concern	of the department of state that the american people are safe and	secure- defense is not a monopoly concern of the department of defense.	7.589030712653635
6085. it is also the concern of the department of state that our	trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous profitable	and active- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of	concern only to the department of commerce.	5.264666557271729
6086. we can no longer rely on	interdepartmental machinery somewhere upstairs to resolve differences	between this and other departments.	6.723383098746229
6087. assistant secretaries of	state will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination	of policies.	4.275314164678009
6088. means must be found to enable us to keep in	touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues	in other departments concerned with foreign policy.	5.197396418037966
6089. i think we	need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action.	5.199997234648329
6090. every	policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer.	6.522871687113793
6091. unless we keep	our eyes on the horizon ahead we shall fail to bring ourselves on target	with the present.	4.239817207121867
6092. the movement of events is so fast the pace so	severe that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are	to think accurately about the present.	4.724029945165832
6093. if there is anything which we	can do in the executive branch of the government to speed up the processes	by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act	promptly that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct	of our affairs.	4.40218210003996
6094. action taken today is often far more valuable than action	taken several months later in response to a situation then out of	control.	5.453041194607851
6095. there will of course be times for delay and inaction.	6.604510074902812
6096. what i am suggesting is that when we delay or when we fail to act	we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic	or procedural difficulties.	5.627609059928511
6097. i also hope that we can	do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas- an affliction	of all bureaucracies.	4.232734803887799
6098. we want to stimulate ideas from the bottom	to the top of the department.	8.09435447048132
6099. we want to make sure that our junior	colleagues realize that ideas are welcome that initiative goes right	down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top.	5.051754731160817
6100. i hope no one	expects that only presidential appointees are looked upon as sources	of ideas.	6.276229978278352
6101. the responsibility for taking the initiative in generating	ideas is that of every officer in the department who has a policy function	regardless of rank.	4.251372919511791
6102. further i would hope that we could	pay attention to little things.	7.257996247843564
6103. while observing the operations of	our government in various parts of the world i have felt that in many	situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor	problems which spoiled our main effort.	4.338899602513836
6104. to cite only a few examples:	the wrong man in the wrong position perhaps even in a junior	position	abroad can be a source of great harm to our policy; the attitudes	of a un delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate	housing in new york city or of a foreign diplomat in similar	circumstances in our capital can be easily be directed against the united	states and all that it stands for.	5.6066371370553645
6105. dozens of seemingly small	matters go wrong all over the world.	5.499419847776101
6106. sometimes those who know about them	are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them.	7.2856552153664
6107. i	would hope that we could create the recognition in the department and	overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the	responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can	do something about them.	3.9515831724237023
6108. if the department of state is to take	primary responsibility for foreign policy in washington it follows	that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas.	6.114649532197321
6109. this does	not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active operational	interested responsible fashion.	4.28837774550632
6110. he is expected to know about what	is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed	in his country.	6.3987028985992005
6111. he is expected to supervise to encourage to direct	to assist in any way he can.	5.510947376776048
6112. if any official operation abroad begins	to go wrong we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and	to get suggestions for remedial action.	5.946413149243083
6113. it occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts	which i expressed privately in recent years in the hope of clearing	up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy	is all about and what it means and of developing a certain compassion	for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside government.	4.190315054892849
6114. i tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems	that a senior departmental policy officer faces.	6.79719554181522
6115. this means practically	everybody in this room.	6.834975815604573
6116. whether it will strike home for you or not	will be for you to determine.	6.849538732239832
6117. the senior policy officer may	be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of	stimuli: an idea in his own head the suggestions of a colleague	a question from the secretary or the president a proposal by another	department a communication from a foreign government or an american	ambassador abroad the filing of an item for the agenda of the united	nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies a news	item read at the breakfast table a question to the president or the	secretary at a news conference a speech by a senator or congressman	an article in a periodical a resolution from a national organization	a request for assistance from some private american interests abroad	et cetera ad infinitum.	3.135141037421314
6118. the policy officer lives with his antennae	alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility.	5.117232935020516
6119. his first thought is about the question itself: is	there a question here for american foreign policy and if so what is	it?	4.312391401913519
6120.  for he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job	is to know what the question is- that when it is accurately identified	it sometimes answers itself and that the way in which it is posed	frequently shapes the answer.	6.945893806596213
6121. chewing it over with his colleagues	and in his own mind he reaches a tentative identification of the	question- tentative because it may change as he explores it further	and because if no tolerable answer can be found it may have to be changed	into one which can be answered.	4.092682490236718
6122. meanwhile he has been thinking	about the facts surrounding the problem facts which he knows can	never be complete and the general background much of which has already	been lost to history.	5.524031535805099
6123. he is appreciative of the expert help available	to him and draws these resources into play taking care to examine	at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently	policy-oriented conclusions.	4.158352754391034
6124. he knows that he must give the expert his	place but he knows that he must also keep him in it.	6.224318541748135
6125. he is	already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action	including doing nothing.	4.374306644526472
6126. he knows that he is thinking about action in	relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful	fog.	6.639901514732483
6127. but he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy	well-established precedents the commitments of the united states	under international charters and treaties basic statutes and well-understood	notions of the american people about how we are to conduct	ourselves in policy literature such as country papers and national security	council papers accumulated in the department.	4.1254497135511965
6128. he will	not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting	results in the factual situation with which he is confronted.	5.659998214484156
6129. he must	think about which of these principles must take precedence.	4.844213633027724
6130. he will	know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his	problem because of crucial changes in circumstance.	5.332721664636918
6131. he is aware that	every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other	problem.	5.04060667774286
6132. he must deal with the question of how to manage a part	when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole- when the whole	is too large to grasp.	6.492415781970297
6133. he must think of others who have a	stake in the question and in its answer.	4.972407196602743
6134. who should be consulted among	his colleagues in the department or other departments and agencies	of the government?	6.1353963209443325
6135.  which american ambassadors could provide helpful	advice?	6.4727126427913975
6136.  are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted?	8.10721517850258
6137. 	what is the probable attitude of other governments including	those less directly involved?	4.521612145192864
6138.  how and at what stage and in what sequence	are other governments to be consulted?	6.468826229435575
6139.    if action is indicated	what kind of action is relevant to the problem?	4.948349938606228
6140.  the selection	of the wrong tools can mean waste at best and at worst an unwanted	inflammation of the problem itself.	5.303342234273332
6141. can the president or the secretary	act under existing authority or will new legislation and new money	be required?	4.456457736319199
6142.  should the action be unilateral or multilateral?	8.124089380473041
6143. 	is the matter one for the united nations or some other international	body?	6.2372886339006275
6144.  for if so the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary	diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem.	5.557014396170859
6145. what type of action can	hope to win public support first in this country and then abroad?	5.167353201277015
6146. 	for the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret	and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned	by the readiness of the country to sustain it.	5.301877783111335
6147. he is interested in	public opinion for two reasons: first because it is important in itself	and second because he knows that the american public cares about	a decent respect for the opinions of mankind.	4.9632307989521465
6148. and given probable	public attitudes- about which reasonably good estimates can be made-	what action is called for to insure necessary support?	5.644803042983258
6149.    may	i add a caution on this particular point?	5.066959048406199
6150.  we do not want policy	officers below the level of presidential appointees to concern themselves	too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign	policy action.	6.053318293439974
6151. in the first place our business is foreign policy	and it is the business of the presidential leadership and his appointees	in the department to consider the domestic political aspects of	a problem.	4.488180327982316
6152. mr truman emphasized this point by saying you fellows	in the department of state don't know much about domestic politics.	5.962471688094592
6153. this is an important consideration.	9.068342801241181
6154. if we sit here	reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls and other reports	that cross our desks we should realize that this is raw undigested	opinion expressed in the absence of leadership.	6.121577286181003
6155. what the american	people will do turns in large degree on their leadership.	5.048734885558309
6156. we cannot	test public opinion until the president and the leaders of the country	have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them	for support for the necessary action.	6.280235277605851
6157. i doubt for example that	3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the	marshall plan any public-opinion expert would have said that the country	would have accepted such proposals.	4.057129580834343
6158. the problem in the	policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly	complicated factors- political military economic financial legal	legislative procedural administrative- to be sorted out and handled	within a political system which moves by consent in relation to	an external environment which cannot be under control.	4.5945726923850785
6159. and the	policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels.	4.6424231631842945
6160. while there should be no general age limit or restriction to one	sex there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and	some open only to men or to women.	5.7456155078077815
6161. the peace corps should not pay	the expenses of a wife or family unless the wife is also accepted for	full-time peace corps work on the same project.	4.237570744244116
6162. there should	be no draft exemption because of peace corps service.	7.489789649007464
6163. in most cases	service in the corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary	deferment.	5.119106639832215
6164. peace corps volunteers obviously should not	be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the united	states.	5.549618309824965
6165. nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in	health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid.	4.387154261258263
6166. the guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation	for individual services.	6.076597153076951
6167. rather the principle should be akin	to that of the allowance.	6.164874541757267
6168. peace corps volunteers should be given	just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living.	6.380764398468363
6169. they should	live in modest circumstances avoiding all conspicuous consumption.	5.173283695837045
6170. wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts.	6.341259820058468
6171. some special health requirements might have to be met.	6.284564812209459
6172. for example	it probably will be necessary for the corps to have authority to	pay medical expenses of volunteers.	6.0863570430936305
6173. perhaps existing public health	service state department and armed services medical facilities	can be utilized.	4.836218585574874
6174. for readjustment to the us volunteers	should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas	service based on the length of time served.	7.268360278985216
6175. the government should the peace corps be established?	5.761242796220414
6176. 	the idea	of a peace corps has captured the imagination of a great many people.	7.869385777516439
6177. support for it cuts across party regional ethnic and other lines.	4.598513348495876
6178. the peace corps therefore offers an opportunity to add a new dimension	to our approach to the world- an opportunity for the american	people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world	development.	5.32763476403759
6179. for this the peace corps should be administered	by a small new alive agency operating as one component in our whole	overseas operation.	4.429305293393199
6180. pending the reorganization of our foreign	aid structure and program the peace corps should be established	as an agency in the department of state.	5.73330173042613
6181. when the aid operations are	reorganized the peace corps should remain a semi-autonomous functional	unit.	5.25935774908076
6182. meanwhile the peace corps could be physically located	in ica's facilities and depend on the state department and	ica for administrative support and when needed program assistance.	6.446343035698134
6183. in this way the peace corps can be launched with its own	identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those	now responsible for united states foreign policy and our overseas	operations.	4.098179117287621
6184. the peace corps can either begin in very low gear with only preparatory	work undertaken between now and when congress finally appropriates	special funds for it- or it can be launched now and in earnest	by executive action with sufficient funds and made available from	existing mutual security appropriations to permit a number of substantial	projects to start this summer.	4.902758503371705
6185. the peace corps should	be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified	people from this year's graduating classes will not be lost.	4.556919448601547
6186. nor	should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university	campuses.	6.357676442044435
6187. if launched in a careful but determined way within	the next few weeks the peace corps could have several hundred	persons in training this summer for placement next fall.	3.959232648292598
6188. within a year	or two several thousand might be in service.	7.4224397112052545
6189. it can then grow steadily	as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated.	6.336878405787754
6190. what would the first projects be?	9.291389153414267
6191. 	in the first year there should	probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects.	4.886962322668286
6192. the need here	is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified	volunteers in a short period of time is greatest.	5.5674039492406315
6193. there would	however be a variety of other skills- medical agricultural engineering-	which would be called for in the first year through the private	agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers	to existing development projects.	4.892340905067145
6194. the first year's projects	should also be spread through several countries in latin america	africa and asia.	5.774422942198309
6195. although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every	newly developing nation the readiness to receive such manpower or to	receive it from the united states will vary from country to country.	4.6525269158784095
6196. a certain skepticism about the coming of americans is to be expected	in many quarters.	6.957410495392925
6197. unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything	in their power to promote active hostility.	4.474485582725863
6198. but there are indications	that many developing nations will welcome peace corps volunteers	and that if the volunteers are well chosen they will soon demonstrate	their value and make many friends.	5.710491578712356
6199. it is important however	that the peace corps be advanced not as an arm of the cold war	but as a contribution to the world community.	5.3691819105301555
6200. in presenting it to	other governments and to the united nations we could propose that	every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the	united nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating	committee.	5.988812355699954
6201. we should hope that peace corps projects will be truly	international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside	citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands.	3.8521107750924255
6202. in any case our peace corps personnel should be offered as technician	helpers in development projects of the un and other international	agencies.	5.733613680442249
6203. the peace corps is not a diplomatic or	propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership.	4.49079675316226
6204. our aim must be to learn as much as we teach.	8.312590228914978
6205. the peace corps	offers an opportunity to bring home to the united states the problems	of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country	needs for trained manpower.	5.129508792397511
6206. if presented in this spirit the response	and the results will be immeasurably better.	6.526693166586096
6207. financed?	11.00104558771429
6208. 	the already appropriated funds within the discretion of	the president and secretary of state under the mutual security	act are the only immediately available source of financing this summer's	pilot programs of the peace corps.	5.170626718349937
6209. if it is decided to make a	small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance	funds in order to carry out the purposes of the mutual security	act through this new peaceful program this will be a hopeful sign	to the world.	4.441894287753548
6210. congress should then be asked to give the peace corps	a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year.	6.490460475291391
6211. specifically	congress should consider authorizing the peace corps to receive	contributions from american businesses unions civic organizations	and the public at large.	4.203150877151224
6212. for this must be the project of the whole	american people.	8.43776420794752
6213. an advisory council of outstanding public figures	with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program	continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding.	4.080480307631525
6214. steps should also be taken to link the food for peace	program with the peace corps so that foreign currencies accumulated	by the sale of us surplus food under pl 480 can be	put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of peace corps	personnel.	5.339305780461131
6215. the extent to which participating bodies such as u	s voluntary agencies universities international organizations	and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should	share the cost of the peace corps programs must be fully explored.	3.8907450670254393
6216. no matter how well	conceived and efficiently run there probably will be failures.	7.413026870858304
6217. these	could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad.	5.096389102623541
6218. but as the popular response suggests the potentiality of the	peace corps is very great.	6.799254817643711
6219. it can contribute to the development of	critical countries and regions.	5.968752237555072
6220. it can promote international cooperation	and good will toward this country.	7.699247252068821
6221. it can also contribute to the	education of america and to more intelligent american participation	in the world.	5.24816759635895
6222. with thousands of young americans going to work	in developing areas millions of americans will become more directly	involved in the world than ever before.	6.215070819270528
6223. with colleges and universities	carrying a large part of the program and with students looking	toward peace corps service there will be an impact on educational	curriculum and student seriousness.	5.280012615961037
6224. the letters home the talks later	given by returning members of the peace corps the influence on	the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad-	all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible	american policies toward the world.	5.573542890802947
6225. and this is meeting the world's	need too since what the world most needs from this country	is better understanding of the world.	4.759388572892254
6226. the peace corps thus can	add a new dimension to america's world policy- one for which people	here and abroad have long been waiting.	5.25974497007753
6227. as you said in your state	of the union message.	5.952725287928569
6228. the problems h are towering and unprecedented-	and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well.	5.189458278990095
6229. i recommend to the congress	the establishment of a permanent peace corps- a pool of trained	american men and women sent overseas by the us government	or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign	countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower.	3.9663561100291362
6230. i	have today signed an executive order establishing a peace corps on	a temporary pilot basis.	6.179802941428369
6231. the temporary peace corps will be	a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more	effective plans for a permanent organization.	3.704527918441701
6232. in addition by starting	the peace corps now we will be able to begin training young men and	women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them	in overseas positions by late fall.	5.5094957892153404
6233. this temporary peace corps is	being established under existing authority in the mutual security	act and will be located in the department of state.	4.531308492692293
6234. its initial expenses	will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign	aid program.	6.24112971061171
6235. throughout the world the people of the newly	developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which	reflects their deepest desires.	5.33667888083292
6236. our own freedom and the future	of freedom around the world depend in a very real sense on their ability	to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity	liberated from the bonds of hunger ignorance and poverty.	5.433916924428751
6237. one of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is	the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and	assist in the operation of development projects- men and women with	the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics	and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages	the mountains the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations.	4.056927194499392
6238. the vast task of economic development urgently requires	skilled people to do the work of the society- to help teach in the	schools construct development projects demonstrate modern methods of	sanitation in the villages and perform a hundred other tasks calling	for training and advanced knowledge.	4.925547282344593
6239. to meet this urgent need	for skilled manpower we are proposing the establishment of a peace	corps- an organization which will recruit and train american volunteers	sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations.	4.283920771537504
6240. this organization will differ from existing assistance programs	in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the	specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical	advice to work.	5.189356820055549
6241. they will help provide the skilled manpower necessary	to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments	acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice.	3.9476010521918354
6242. there is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve	will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them.	7.707970847337572
6243. in 1960 one-quarter of the 92.	6.841467019233795
6244. 5 million	recreation visits to the national forests and grasslands were for	the primary purpose of hunting and fishing.	6.422613203061514
6245. hunter and fisherman visits	since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the nationwide sale	of hunting and fishing licenses.	4.078295772533248
6246. this use is expected to increase to	about 50 million visits by 1972.	6.904714727524695
6247. the long-range objective of habitat	management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and	game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment.	4.432806873108299
6248. the wildlife habitat management proposals for the 10-year period	are:  revise and complete wildlife habitat management	and improvement plans for all administrative units assuring proper coordination	between wildlife habitat management and other resources.	4.706577096389665
6249. inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation	with other federal agencies and with the states in which national	forests and grasslands are located as a basis for orderly development	of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs including	big-game gamebird and small-game habitat surveys and investigations	on the 186 million acres of national forests and grasslands	fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81000 miles	of national forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes	and impoundments and participation in planning inspection and	control phases of all habitat improvement land- and water-use projects	conducted on national forest lands by states other federal agencies	and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife	and be in harmony with other resource values.	3.281314151698472
6250. improve food	and cover on 1.	8.18656221502958
6251. 5 million acres of key wildlife areas.	6.8692091801571955
6252. develop	wildlife openings food patches and game ways in dense vegetation	by clearing or controlled burning on 400000 acres.	5.368720319504203
6253. improve	7000 miles of fishing streams and 56000 acres of lakes by stabilizing	banks planting streamside cover and constructing channel improvements.	3.8880356915934375
6254. the total adverse impact of disease insects	fire weather destructive animals and other forces on the uses and	values of forest resources is not generally recognized.	4.869790031688615
6255. they kill and	destroy retard or prevent reproduction and growth impair and damage	values and disrupt uses.	4.314931266205686
6256. the loss in growth of sawtimber because	of damage by destructive agencies in the united states in 1952	was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet.	5.664175141407725
6257. if it were not for the	effect of destructive agencies sawtimber growth would have been nearly	twice as great as the 47 billion board feet in 1952.	4.637925584568286
6258. about 45 percent	of the loss in growth was attributable to disease 20 percent to	insects 17 percent to fire and 18 percent to weather animals and	various other causes.	5.194691166104775
6259. these destructive forces also have a seriously	adverse effect upon the watersheds and their life-supporting waterflows	and upon the other renewable forest resources.	4.101439600996838
6260. the long-range	objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below	the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management	of the national forest system under principles of multiple use and	high-level sustained yield of products and services.	4.6379117309030855
6261. this can be accomplished	substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities	and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical	fire periods and a more intensive application of a program of prevention	detection and control of insect and disease infestations.	3.9487487864992583
6262. in	addition to direct protection measures more intensive management of	timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and	disease.	5.38002513935123
6263. in the 10-year period	it is proposed that insect and disease control on the national forest	system be stepped up to a level of prevention detection and	control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce	the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial	period.	3.807494367874258
6264. this will require about a 40 percent increase over the present	level of protection.	6.517000798864072
6265. the work will consist of:  intensification	of present activities through quicker more extensive and	more thorough surveys to detect incipient outbreaks; more reliable	evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread	damage; quicker and more effective control action in the initial	stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic.	3.5692488080493177
6266. the initial suppression	activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated.	5.390282460996567
6267. continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension	of control to 250000 acres not now protected but which should	be managed for white pine production.	3.692532313021866
6268. the objective is to achieve sufficient	effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment	plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance	control will be needed.	5.2645113996282324
6269. initiating a program to control	dwarfmistletoe on several hundred thousand acres of selected better	stands of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites.	3.7992019768996257
6270. coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities	to reduce losses.	6.093123995732186
6271. it is proposed	that in	10 years all commercial timberlands all critical watersheds and	other lands in the national forest system developed or proposed for	intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the	fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads.	3.5772749675432514
6272. this	will include 125 million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving	such protection.	5.7836982265615156
6273. an additional 15 million acres will be given	a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation.	4.399146608478677
6274. meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for:	expansion modernization and development of fire control	to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many	fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted	standards.	4.853840123599108
6275. this is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present	level of preventive effort detection skilled fire-fighting crews	and equipment use.	4.934419434306034
6276. this will include a stepped-up program of training	and development of personnel.	7.145144631067982
6277. adoption and use of new and	modern techniques being developed for prevention for suppression of fires	while small and for stopping large fires while running and burning	intensely.	3.7359194398670494
6278. reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize	the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value	areas.	5.454336586728915
6279. this work will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land	needing such treatment and will consist of burning 250000 acres of highly	hazardous debris concentration felling snags on 350000 acres of	high lightning-occurrence areas prescribed burning on 3.	3.5548810750833146
6280. 5 million acres	removing roadside fuel on 39000 acres and clearing and maintaining	11000 miles of firebreaks.	6.269944951927349
6281. rodent	control work for the 10-year period will be aimed at control of	the most serious infestations of harmful rodents such as porcupines	and mice on high-value areas of forage and commercial timberlands.	3.6010679232796665
6282. these	areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation	on the national forests.	7.411791156269969
6283. 8 million acres of rangelands	and 9.	6.583401756992765
6284. 4 million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period.	6.877147045937237
6285. control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means	of control are known.	4.649273031646188
6286. the transportation	system which serves the national forests is a complex of highways and	access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions.	4.8856159998038295
6287. this system is divided into a forest highway system administered by	the secretary of commerce and a forest development road and trail system	administered by the secretary of agriculture.	4.067724265607541
6288. both of these	systems are essential for the production development and use of the	national	forests.	7.028453059262645
6289. in the forest highway system there are now	24400 miles of public roads.	5.000592139043374
6290. these are mostly through highways that	carry traffic going from one destination to another.	6.524110066782459
6291. because administration	of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the secretary	of commerce with maintenance provided by the states and counties	this development program for the national forests does not include	estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system	nor to construct the additions to its that are needed.	3.937208307670133
6292. it is estimated	that about 70000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed	to fully serve the national forests.	5.629275869915444
6293. in the forest development	road and trail system there are now 162400 miles of roads and	106500 miles of supplemental foot and horse trails.	4.229872353071391
6294. these roads are	largely of less than highway standards and usually carry traffic which	is related to use of the national forests.	6.397719231713944
6295. construction and maintenance	of this system is a responsibility of the secretary of agriculture.	5.825870071188104
6296. it is estimated that about 542250 miles of forest development	roads and 80000 miles of trails constitute the system that will eventually	be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of	the wood water forage and wildlife and recreation resources of the	national forests on a continuing basis.	4.742085777985769
6297. the ultimate trail system	will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization	and fire protection.	3.814568957713512
6298. it will be carefully planned to maintain optimum	service to these important resources and watersheds.	6.914995406373657
6299. the presence	or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling	influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as:	and wildlife resources	from fire insects and disease;	the volume of timber that	can be marketed especially for small sales and the support of dependent	the level	of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity	to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire windstorm insects	the protection of watershed lands from erosion	and overgrazing by animals.	3.25524005517726
6300. the existence of road systems	permits an intensity of management and use for all national forest purposes	that is not otherwise possible.	4.918362506885915
6301. furthermore roads that give	access to national forest timber are investments which pay their own	way over a period of years.	4.401462676895143
6302. use of these roads by the public results	in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve.	6.178453810198518
6303. the	long-range objective of this department is to provide and maintain	a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately	service the national forest system at the levels needed to meet expected	needs and optimum production of products and services.	3.4997189935124355
6304. for the	year 2000 this means servicing the protection requirements of a watershed	producing at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year	recreation and wildlife resources used each year by 635 million visitors	a timber resource supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board	feet and 60 million acres of rangelands.	4.61511775468881
6305. service at these	levels of production and utilization will eventually require the	construction of about 379900 miles of new roads and 6000 miles of new	trails along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about 105000	miles of roads and 10500 miles of trails.	3.5411091133423223
6306. about 26500 miles	of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of	new roads.	6.342919750795958
6307. about 80 percent of these long-range requirements should be	met by the year 2000.	4.760058332267235
6308. program proposals for forest development	roads and trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows:	complete the construction and reconstruction of about 79400	miles of multiple-purpose roads and 8000 miles of trails.	4.7840956183626915
6309. this constitutes	about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities.	5.020051743702746
6310. approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on	roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed	by purchasers of national forest timber but paid for by	the government through adjustment of stumpage prices.	5.353882795277177
6311. provide	maintenance to full standards on the 268900 miles of existing access	roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during	the period.	4.233553831479673
6312. within the	units in the national forest system the pattern of land ownership	is quite irregular.	7.274130709981448
6313. in some units national forest ownership is well	blocked together.	5.734667513807466
6314. in many others the previous patenting of land	under the public land laws or the way in which land was available for	purchase resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership.	5.750500364416919
6315. within	exterior boundaries of national forests and national grasslands	there are about 40000000 acres in non-federal ownership.	4.131860641767443
6316. one consequence	is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners	of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring	national forest or other federal land or because such ownerships are	developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public	of neighboring national forest land.	4.723888918090058
6317. some privately held inholdings	are a source of direct damage to these federal lands.	5.063818353813186
6318. and some which	are suitable for tree growing and for other national forest purposes	are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation and are contributing	nothing to the economy; there are no reasonable prospects	that these conditions will be corrected or changed.	4.9374499367998945
6319. lands in this last	category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the eastern	states.	4.351309221903389
6320. the long-range objective is to bring about consolidation	of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through	purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts	for recognized national forest programs such as recreation development	or which are a source of damage to lands in national forests	and national grasslands.	4.537797507499101
6321. strategy and tactics of the us military forces are now	undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history.	5.297335100633853
6322. the change of	emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made	with care mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected	in favor of the other.	5.172321297150019
6323. our military forces must be capable of	contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon	us from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war.	4.162941490421492
6324. the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately	the present level- a year-end strength of 2489000 men and	women in the active forces.	4.833739115932384
6325. the forces to be supported include an army	of 14 divisions and 870000 men; a navy of 817 active ships and	619000 men; a marine corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175000	men; and an air force of 91 combat wings and 825000 men.	3.332983550680156
6326. if the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war	their basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing	character and missions of the active forces.	5.306834714388264
6327. quality and combat readiness	must take precedence over mere numbers.	4.855658467968249
6328. under modern conditions	this is especially true of the ready reserve.	7.594335153875298
6329. i have requested the	secretary of defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve	components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light	of the changing requirements of modern warfare.	4.544208392515296
6330. last year	the congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength	limitations on the army reserve.	6.276363084108544
6331. similar restrictions on the	strength of the army national guard contained in the 1960 department	of defense appropriation act should likewise be dropped.	4.542831400908391
6332. i strongly	recommend to the congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on	the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility	to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity.	5.8185541152464975
6333. i again	proposed a reduction in the army national guard and army reserve-	from their present strengths of 400000 and 300000 respectively	to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961.	4.176575293832882
6334. these	strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions	of the reserves in support of our national security objectives.	6.17163127211912
6335. about 30% of the expenditures for	the department of defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs	including pay for active reserve and retired military personnel.	3.9245884923122207
6336. these	expenditures are estimated to be $12.	7.603896187885215
6337. 1 billion an increase of $187	million over 1960 reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel	more dependents an increased number of men drawing proficiency	pay and social security tax increases	.	3.9334113008909015
6338. retired pay costs are	increased by $94 million in 1961 over 1960 partly because of a substantial	increase in the number of retired personnel.	6.277328069065593
6339. these increased costs	are partially offset by a decrease of $56 million in expenditures	for the reserve forces largely because of the planned reduction in strength	of the army reserve components during 1961.	3.9703852989270847
6340. traditionally	rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate	to current rates of pay for active personnel.	5.368720319504203
6341. the 1958 military	pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6%	increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior	to its effective date of june 1 1958.	3.54521913303299
6342. i endorse pending legislation	that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and	active duty pay rates.	5.86642880258022
6343. expenditures	for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the armed	forces are estimated to be $10.	4.180070929261795
6344. 3 billion in 1961 which is $184	million more than in 1960.	7.095995424582777
6345. the increase stems largely from the growing	complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons	and equipment.	3.847943935456328
6346. a substantial increase is estimated in the	cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense	program as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications	are essential.	6.1101140954305
6347. also the program for fleet modernization	will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures.	5.022875095510689
6348. further	increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted	by the congress last year.	5.7836982265615156
6349. other factors increasing operating	costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour up 11% in two	years and of each steaming hour up 15%.	3.86698429609179
6350. in total these increases	in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining	programs and from economy measures such as reduced numbers of units	and installations smaller inventories of major equipment and improvements	in the supply and distribution systems of the armed forces.	4.76736397906896
6351. in the budget message for 1959 and again for 1960 i recommended	immediate repeal of section 601 of the act of september 28 1951	.	4.096603989956124
6352. this section prevents the military departments and	the office of civil and defense mobilization from carrying out certain	transactions involving real property unless they come into agreement	with the committees on armed services of the senate and the house	of representatives.	4.840832387251038
6353. as i have stated previously the attorney	general has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional	principles.	4.940657836817231
6354. accordingly if it is not repealed by the congress	at its present session i shall have no alternative thereafter but	to direct the secretary of defense to disregard the section unless	a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise.	5.933423362735083
6355. basic	long-line communications in alaska are now provided through federal	facilities operated by the army air force and federal aviation	agency.	3.965532388302303
6356. the growing communications needs of this new state can best	be met as they have in other states through the operation and development	of such facilities by private enterprise.	4.835518404705188
6357. legislation has already	been proposed to authorize the sale of these government-owned	systems in alaska and its early enactment is desirable.	4.1990680023455536
6358. for the department of defense are for procurement research	development and construction programs.	7.717160987636887
6359. in 1961 these expenditures	are estimated at $18.	5.932316768192843
6360. 9 billion compared to $19.	8.491694133126042
6361. the	decreases which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement	are offset in part by increases for research and development and	for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks vehicles	guns and electronic devices.	3.6242152954577165
6362. expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated	at about the same level as in 1960.	6.579872159651585
6363. new obligational authority	for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement	totals $4753	million which is $1390 million below that enacted for 1960.	4.049031098304415
6364. on the	other hand the new authority of $3825 million proposed for missile	procurement in 1961 is $581 million	higher than for 1960.	5.729405127375057
6365. these contrasting trends in procurement reflect	the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our armed	forces in the years ahead.	4.277508246157835
6366. the department of defense appropriation	acts for the past several years have contained a rider which	limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain	military supply items.	5.723948009631778
6367. as i have repeatedly stated this provision is	much more restrictive than the general law popularly known as the buy	american act.	4.8695444522066245
6368. i urge once again that the congress not reenact	this rider.	6.870007361723173
6369. the task of providing a reasonable level of military	strength without endangering other vital aspects of our security	is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress.	3.737371112820175
6370. the	last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances	in military technology in history.	5.722004219108585
6371. some weapons systems have	become obsolescent while still in production and some while still under	development.	4.606039749871511
6372. furthermore unexpectedly rapid progress or a	technological break-through on any one weapon system in itself often	diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems.	5.287744184837056
6373. this	has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense	program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important	weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems	which have been overtaken by events.	3.661430211966264
6374. thus in the last few years a	number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development	was commenced have since been completely eliminated.	6.932195140852026
6375. for example	the importance of the regulus 2 a very promising aerodynamic	ship-to-surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines	was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more	advanced polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines.	3.5877086307914525
6376. another example is the recent cancellation of the f-108	a long-range interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed	of sound which was designed for use against manned bombers in the	period of the mid-1960's.	5.119175963692426
6377. the substantial progress being made in ballistic	missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned	bombers to missiles.	3.773008925970159
6378. considering the high cost of the f-108	system- over $4 billion for the force that had been planned- and	the time period in which it would become operational it was decided to	stop further work on the project.	5.86493964817713
6379. meanwhile other air defense forces	are being made effective as described later in this message.	4.511666080571532
6380. the size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from	earlier plans.	6.14321061042328
6381. notable in this category are the jupiter and thor	intermediate range ballistic missiles which have been successfully developed	produced and deployed but the relative importance of which	has diminished with the increasing availability of the atlas intercontinental	ballistic missile.	3.596318060052011
6382. the impact of technological factors	is also illustrated by the history of the high-energy fuel program.	6.628664652607234
6383. this project was started at a time when there was a critical need for	a high-energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance	aircraft particularly our heavy bombers.	4.220885690269286
6384. continuing technical	problems involved in the use of this fuel coupled with significant	improvements in aircraft range through other means have now raised serious	questions about the value of the high-energy fuel program.	6.140119428888874
6385. as	a result the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed.	4.740858050060867
6386. these examples underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations	of new major development programs and even more penetrating and	far-ranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology.	5.479395666325546
6387. the	cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the	greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development	in determining the most satisfactory rate of development and in	deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production	or to abandon it.	3.3983640996371314
6388. the deterrent power	of our armed forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability	and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any	form of war.	4.698723859097317
6389. the first capability is represented by a combination	of manned bombers carrier-based aircraft and intercontinental and intermediate	range missiles.	4.451782627363053
6390. the second capability is represented by our	deployed ground naval and air forces in essential forward areas together	with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement.	5.078020572782926
6391. the strategic air command is the principal element	of our long-range nuclear capability.	4.12596267992654
6392. one of the important and difficult	decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role	of the b-70 a long-range supersonic bomber.	6.866336271401596
6393. this aircraft which	was planned for initial operational use about 1965 would be complementary	to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile	systems all of which are scheduled to become available earlier.	3.843235715326959
6394. the first atlas icbm's are now operational the first two	polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year	and the first titan icbm's next year.	5.668129334007725
6395. the minuteman solid-fueled	icbm is planned to be operational about mid-1963.	4.200697917275358
6396. by	1965 several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and	their reliability established.	6.356763815251825
6397. thus the need for the b-70	as a strategic weapon system is doubtful.	6.111589549585077
6398. however i am recommending	that development work on the b-70 air-frame and engines be continued.	6.850244422162507
6399. it is expected that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available	for flight testing.	4.640121402322442
6400. by that time we should be in a much better	position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system.	7.764349355712646
6401. i am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version	of the b-52	and procurement of the b-58 supersonic medium bomber together with	the supporting refueling tankers in each case.	3.8936672318842644
6402. these additional modern	bombers will replace some of the older b-47 medium bombers;	one b-52 can do the work of several b-47's which it will replace.	6.38629391435888
6403. funds are also included in this budget to continue the equipping	of the b-52 wings with the hound dog air-to-surface missile.	3.985392805510451
6404. in the coming fiscal year additional quantities of atlas titan	and polaris missiles also will be procured.	6.2412757536498775
6405. purchase authorizations will include provisions relating to the sale	and delivery of commodities including the classes types andor varieties	of food grain the time and circumstances of deposit of the rupees	accruing	from such sale and other relevant matters.	3.593751906969363
6406. the united states	recognizes the desire of india to accumulate as quickly as possible	a substantial part of the one million ton reserve stock of rice	provided for in this agreement to assist in stabilizing the internal	markets for this commodity in india.	5.056841958816717
6407. under this agreement the first	annual review of rice availabilities will be made in august 1960.	5.285960349062089
6408. at that time consideration will be given to whether in the light of	the united states supplies of rice available for title 1 disposal	india's production consumption and stocks of food grains other	imports from the united states and countries friendly to the united	states india's storage capacity and other related factors any	increase would be possible in the portion of the total rice programmed	which is currently planned for procurement during the first year.	5.609960398202088
6409. the two governments agree that the issuance of purchase authorizations	for wheat and rice providing for purchase after june 30 1961	shall be dependent upon the determination by the united states	government that these commodities are in surplus supply and available	under title 1 of the act at that time.	3.5389903239795575
6410. the united states government	shall have the right to terminate the financing of further sales	under this agreement of any commodity if it determines at any time	after june 30 1961 that such action is necessitated by the existence	of an international emergency.	5.070278187490702
6411. the two governments agree that the rupees accruing to the government	of the united states of america as a consequence of sales	made pursuant to this agreement will be used by the government of	the united states of america in such manner and order of priority	as the government of the united states of america shall determine	for united	states expenditures under subsections	of section 104 of the act or under	for grant to the government of india under subsection	of section 104 of the act the rupee equivalent of not more than $538	million for financing such projects to promote balanced economic development	for loan	to the government of india under subsection of section 104	of the act the rupee equivalent of not more than $538 million for	financing such projects to promote balanced economic development as may	be mutually agreed.	3.7322576447473925
6412. the terms and conditions of the loan and other	provisions will be set forth in a separate agreement by the two governments.	5.268370488597766
6413. in the event that agreement is not reached on the use	of the rupees for grant or loan purposes within six years from the date	of this agreement the government of the united states of america	may use the local currency for any purposes authorized by section	104 of the act.	3.9806099289879584
6414. in the event the total of rupees accruing	to the government of the united states of america as a consequence	of sales made pursuant to this agreement is different from the rupee	equivalent of $1276 million the amounts available for the purposes	specified in paragraph 1 article 2 will be adjusted proportionately.	5.518015524754117
6415. the deposit of rupees to	the account of the government of the united states of america in payment	for the commodities and for ocean transportation costs financed	by the government of the united states of america	costs resulting from the requirement that united states flag vessels	shall be made at the rate of exchange for united states dollars	generally applicable to import transactions	in effect on the dates of dollar disbursement	by united states banks or by the government of the united states	of america as provided in the purchase authorizations.	4.337590020836952
6416. 4 general undertakings	the government of india agrees	that it will take all possible measures to prevent the resale or	transshipment to other countries or the use for other than domestic purposes	of	the surplus agricultural commodities purchased pursuant to the provisions	of this agreement and to assure that the purchase of such commodities	does not result in increased availability of these or like commodities	for export from india.	4.737815136104474
6417. the two governments agree that	they will take reasonable precautions to assure that all sales or purchases	of surplus agricultural commodities pursuant to the agreement	will not displace usual marketings of the united states of america	in these commodities or unduly disrupt world prices of agricultural	commodities or normal patterns of commercial trade with friendly countries.	3.6395184758304744
6418. in carrying out this agreement the two governments	will seek to assure to the extent practicable conditions of commerce	permitting private traders to function effectively and will use their	best endeavors to develop and extend continuous market demand for agricultural	commodities.	4.8906960865870115
6419. the government of india agrees to	furnish upon request of the united states of america information	on the progress of the program particularly with respect to the arrival	and condition of commodities and the provisions for the maintenance	of usual marketings and information relating to exports of the same	or like commodities.	4.23230800046745
6420. the two governments	will upon the request of either of them consult regarding any	matter relating to the application of this agreement or to the operation	of arrangements carried out pursuant to this agreement.	5.2456526469721485
6421. 6 entry into force	the agreement shall enter into force upon	signature.	4.750643914337774
6422. in witness whereof the respective representatives	duly authorized for the purpose have signed the present agreement.	6.03737988562565
6423. done at washington in duplicate this fourth day of	may 1960.	4.681571082223364
6424. for the government of the united states of america:	dwight d eisenhower   for the government	of india:   s k patil	excellency:   i have the honor to refer to the agricultural	commodities agreement signed today between the government of the	united states of america and the government of india	and with regard to the rupees accruing	to uses indicated under article 2 of the agreement to state	that the understanding of the government of the united states of	america is as follows:  with respect to article 2 paragraph	the government	of india will provide facilities for the conversions of the rupee equivalent	of $4 million accruing	under the subject agreement for agricultural market development purposes	into currencies other than united states dollars on request of	the government of the united states of america.	5.583830685467954
6425. this facility is	needed for the purpose of securing funds to finance agricultural market	development activities of the government of the united states in	other countries.	5.392342984630648
6426. the government of the united states of america	may utilize rupees in india to pay for goods and services including	international transportation needed in connection with market development	and other agricultural projects and activities in india and	other countries.	5.962201015618734
6427. but not more than 5 percent of the currencies received under the agreement	will be used for loans to be made by the export-import bank	of washington under section 104 of the agricultural trade	development and assistance act as amended	and for administrative expenses of the export-import	bank of washington in india incident thereto.	3.967765072644923
6428. it is understood that:	such loans under section 104 of the act will	be made to united states business firms and branches subsidiaries	or affiliates of such firms in india for business development and trade	expansion in india and to united states firms and to indian firms	for the establishment of facilities for aiding in the utilization	distribution or otherwise increasing the consumption of and markets	for united states agricultural products.	4.598534749092834

6441. the two governments shall have the	right at all reasonable times to examine such books and records and	all other documents correspondence memoranda and other records involving	transactions relating to agreed projects.	3.5785371765295224
6442. the government of india	shall enable the authorized representatives of the united states	to observe and review agreed projects and the utilization of goods and	services financed under the projects and shall furnish to the united	states all such information as it shall reasonably request concerning	the above-mentioned matters and the expenditures related thereto.	4.826623976666814
6443. this broad delegation leaves within our discretion	both the determination	of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive and the	methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided.	3.6493237668380574
6444. the present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast	band from 540 kc to 1600 kc.	6.5315303796004605
6445. whenever two or more standard	broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent	frequencies each interferes to some extent with reception of	the other.	4.564724222034658
6446. the extent of such interference- which may be so slight	as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders	a usable signal or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service	areas of both stations- depends on many factors among the principal	ones being the distance between the stations their respective	radiated power and of particular significance here the time of day.	4.753886010954104
6447. other factors playing a part in the the extent of am service	and interference are the frequency involved the time of year the position	of the year in the sunspot cycle ground conductivity along	the	transmission path atmospheric and manmade noise and others.	4.137666415981443
6448. with the	existence of these many factors some of them variable it obviously	has never been and is not now possible for the commission to make assignments	of am stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure	against any interference in any circumstances.	5.20621491977064
6449. rather such assignments	are made as they must be on the basis of certain overall rules	and standards representing to some extent a statistical approach to	the problem taking into account for each situation some of the variables	and averaging out others	in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection	against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of	stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the nation.	3.8858884278955963
6450. an example of the overall standards applied is the 20-to-1 ratio established	for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference	which is regarded as objectionable.	5.811666692089389
6451. by this standard it is determined	that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved	objectionable interference from station a exists at any point within	the service area of station b where station a's signal	is of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station b's	signal at that point.	3.8177720353890314
6452. the 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel	interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which	we must always take into account in am assignments and allocations-	that signals from a particular station are potential sources	of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within	which they provide useful service.	4.656625625449788
6453. a second fundamental principle	is that involved particularly in the present proceeding- the difference	between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect	to the standard broadcast frequencies.	4.002097757272081
6454. this is a phenomenon familiar	to all radio listeners resulting from reflection of skywave signals at	night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere.	5.72654429496998
6455. all am stations radiate both skywave and groundwave signals	at all hours; but during the middle daytime hours these skywave	radiations are not reflected in any substantial quantity and during	this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference	are in general negligible.	3.927581585214505
6456. but during nighttime hours the skywave	radiations are reflected from the ionosphere thereby creating the possibility	of one station's rendering service via skywave at a much	greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal and at the	same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the	still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference	to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent	frequencies.	4.61201719520924
6457. because of the difference between daytime and nighttime	propagation conditions it has been necessary to evolve different allocation	structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the am	band with many more stations operating during the day than at night.	4.245152697286862
6458. it was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime	to nighttime propagation conditions and vice versa is not an instantaneous	process but takes place over periods of time from roughly	2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset and again from	roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise.	4.687336588342195
6459. during	the period of about 4 hours around sunset skywave transmission conditions	are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail; during	the same period around sunrise skywave transmission is declining	until at about 2 hours after sunrise it reaches a point where it becomes	of little practical significance.	3.4990149887787396
6460. however in this case as elsewhere	it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to	all situations representing an averaging of conditions and thus to	fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points	between daytime and nighttime conditions.	5.69445340215214
6461. it was determined that	the hours of sunrise and sunset respectively should be used for this	purpose.	5.148396405692202
6462. accordingly the 1938-39 rules adopted these hours as limitations	upon the operation of daytime stations.	6.4748760330211095
6463. class 2 stations	operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate	under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset	or sunset at the location of the dominant	class 1 station where located west of the class 2 station	.	3.8070846527267266
6464. the same restrictions apply	after local sunset in the case of class 3 stations operating on	regional channels which after that time are required to operate under	nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other.	5.633427499293251
6465. with respect	to nighttime assignments the degree of skywave service and interference	is determined by skywave curves	giving average skywave values.	4.592556059405676
6466. these curves were derived	by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data.	6.597736666311408
6467. it was recognized	that skywave signals because of their reflected nature are of great	variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength.	4.4961012071653705
6468. for this	reason the more uncertain skywave service was denominated secondary	in our rules as compared to the steadier more reliable groundwave	primary service and for both skywave service and skywave	interference signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of	time a particular signal-intensity level is exceeded- 50 percent of	the time for skywave service 10 percent of the time for skywave interference.	5.0863599149571295
6469. as mentioned the allocation	of am stations represents a balance between protection against	interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number	of stations.	4.074610640354365
6470. the rules and policies to be applied in this process of	course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired	if radio service is to be of maximum use to the nation.	5.629870441876587
6471. our objectives	to provide some	to provide as many choices of	to provide service	of local origin to as many listeners as possible.	4.192993451968678
6472. since broadcast	frequencies are very limited in number these objectives are to some	extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized and	to the extent that each is realized there is a corresponding reduction	of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others.	5.443377590108269
6473. accordingly	the commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern	for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern	for other frequencies and has assigned different frequencies for use	by different classes of stations.	3.5652351826088364
6474. some 45 frequencies are assigned for	use primarily by dominant class 1- a or class 1-	b clear-channel stations designed to operate with adequate	power and to provide service- both groundwave and skywave-	over large areas and at great distances being protected against	interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective.	4.773044822020194
6475. in dealing	with these frequencies the objective listed first above- provision	of service to all listeners- was predominant; the other objectives	were subordinated to it.	3.858377016419732
6476. the class 1 stations on these clear	channels are protected to their 0.	5.578519827945279
6477. 1-mvm groundwave contours	against daytime cochannel interference.	5.66037853959279
6478. with respect to skywave service	rendered at night class 1- a stations are the only stations	permitted to operate in the united states on clear channels specified	for class 1- a operation and so render skywave service	free	from cochannel interference whereever they may be received; class	1- b stations are protected at night to their 0.	5.148819114191836
6479. 5-mvm	50-percent	time skywave contours against cochannel interference.	5.66037853959279
6480. since	the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference	only class 1 stations are capable of rendering skywave service.	5.6099892424930635
6481. but nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course	entails skywave interference to groundwave service interference which	is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it.	3.9601725656948963
6482. with	respect to other frequencies these are designated as regional or local	and assigned for use by class 3 and class 4 stations respectively	stations operating generally with lower power.	4.911638703765829
6483. in the allocation	pattern worked out for these frequencies the provision of long-range	service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives-	assignment of multiple facilities and assignment of stations	in as many communities as possible.	3.849227487638811
6484. as mentioned the primary	allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations	on clear channels is the provision of widespread service free from	destructive interference.	5.2717257028606115
6485. during nighttime hours because of the intense	skywave propagation then prevailing no large number of stations can	be permitted to operate on one of these channels if the wide area	service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily	by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render	it.	4.221584911178089
6486. therefore under our longstanding allocation rules on some of	these channels no station other than the dominant	station is permitted to operate at night so that the 1- a	station can render service interference free wherever it can be received.	5.51243403829878
6487. on the remainder of the clear channels the dominant	stations are protected as described above and the relatively	small number of secondary stations permitted to operate	on these channels at night are required to operate directionally	andor with reduced power so as to protect the class 1 stations.	3.8938393603332346
6488. in the daytime on the other hand since skywave transmission is relatively	inefficient it is possible to assign a substantially larger number	of stations on these channels.	6.14889624006893
6489. additional class 2 assignments	for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference	to the class 1 stations or to each other and by their operation	provide additional service on these channels and additional local	outlets for a large number of communities.	4.076234919282008
6490. such additional daytime	class 2 assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made	of these frequencies and the commission has over the years made a large	number of them.	5.814945858481193
6491. similarly on the regional channels many class 3	stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate	nighttime with directional antennas andor lower power.	3.8033671795196144
6492. essentially the question presented for decision in the present daytime	skywave proceeding is whether our decision in 1938-1939 to	assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset	is sound as a basis for am allocations or whether in the light	of later developments and new understanding skywave transmission	is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and	after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account and	some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these	hours.	4.681429672043007
6493. the decision	reached in 1938-39 was made after the accumulation of a large amount	of data and thorough study thereof.	4.067378922676922
6494. since then there has been a notable	increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional	data and the development of new techniques for using it leading	to a better understanding of propagation phenomena.	6.631960577563879
6495. in 1947 affidavits	were filed with the commission by various clear-channel stations	alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service	areas of these stations during daylight hours from class 2 stations	whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to	create skywave intereference.	3.439778608679341
6496. if you elect to use the standard deduction or the tax table and	later find you should have itemized your deductions you may do so by	filing an amended return within the time prescribed for filing a claim	for refund.	5.312898160693658
6497. see you may claim a refund page 135.	5.743251577089417
6498. the same	is true if you have itemized your deductions and later decide you should	have used the standard deduction or tax table.	5.251665274258999
6499. the words amended	return should be plainly written across the top of such return.	4.779636920872235

6580. the one- or two-season hunt of which there have been too many recently	may do more harm than good; for such programs raise hopes of assistance	toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which	are dashed when the programs are discontinued; and they are dashed	no less by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development	toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit.	4.79313472487662
6581. for	the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any	foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments	of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good: such judgments	can be known to be good only by the records of those selected	by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods	of time.	3.611597567002463
6582. the central group of the foundation's advisors	are at any one period of time the members of our advisory board	consisting now of thirty-six men and women.	5.882494475368432
6583. they are chosen by the	foundation's board of trustees on the bases of their own first-rate	accomplishments in their different fields of scholarship and the arts.	4.349811797445124
6584. their locations in all parts of the united states and their locations	in the several kinds of educational and research institutions	that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths	also are factors in the trustees' minds.	6.030660249494329
6585. for this concept of an	advisory board ancillary to the board of trustees we are indebted	to the late president of harvard university a lawrence lowell	a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions	and their administration.	4.488207027283123
6586. that we had the wit and wisdom to adopt mr	lowell's concept and make it the base for our processes of selection	is one reason why our selections have been it may be said truly	pretty uniformly good.	5.776350608962229
6587. for in accordance with mr lowell's	concept of an advisory board our selections are made by experienced	selectors who give both constancy and consistency to our processes	and our choices.	4.018000742671479
6588. and lest we should become too consistent in the	sense of becoming heedless of new fields of scholarship and new points	of view in the arts the foundation's board of trustees maintains	a trickle- not a flow!- of new members through the advisory board.	5.1218963660031225
6589. two committees of members of the advisory board constitute	the committees of selection- one for the selection of fellows	from canada the united states and the english-speaking caribbean	area and one for the selection of fellows from the latin american	republics and the republic of the philippines.	4.361524793183438
6590. to the members	of our advisory board and most specially to its members who constitute	our committees of selection the foundation is indebted for its	successes of choice of fellows.	5.236027030393506
6591. we are as we know utterly dependent	on the quality of advice we get; and quality of advice added to	devotion to the foundation's purposes and ideals we do get from	our advisory board in measures so full that they can be appreciated	only by those of us who work here every day.	4.249194705054442
6592. but the facts about	our advisory board and its members' duties are only one of several	sets of facts about the quest for advice both reliable and imaginative	on which to base our selections of fellows.	5.244900388182503
6593. for example the	interest of past members of the foundation's advisory board remains	such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal	much as they had done when they were formally members of that board.	4.090380517404364
6594. and besides there are a large number of scholars artists composers	of music novelists poets essayists choreographers lawyers servants	of government and men of affairs- hundreds indeed- who serve	the foundation well with the advice they give us freely and gratis	out of their experience.	5.3091333938600656
6595. to all the foundation gives the kind	of thanks which are more than thanks: to them we are grateful beyond	the possibility of conveying in words how grateful we are.	3.961406859566443
6596. it is a truism of business that no business can be better than	its board of directors and its top management.	5.991061694824048
6597. the same is true of	every foundation.	6.277306665283958
6598. during the biennium reviewed in this report our	board of trustees named able men younger than the rest of us to the	board and to top management to insure future continuance of the first-class	administration of the foundation's affairs:   dr	james brown fisk physicist president of the bell telephone laboratories	was elected to the board of trustees.	5.450877258627769
6599. he is a member	both of the national academy of sciences and of the american philosophical	society; and he has served our country well as a scientific	statesman on international commissions.	5.324097066612539
6600. dr gordon n	ray provost vice-president and professor of english in the university	of illinois was appointed associate secretary general.	5.683213587129919
6601. the trustees of the foundation appointed dr ray to that position	with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present secretary	general upon the latter's eventual retirement.	3.7953380149618456
6602. dr ray is	a fellow of the foundation- appointed thrice to assist his studies	of william makepeace thackeray and of h g wells- and	before his appointment to the foundation's executive staff had been	given our highest scholarly accolade appointment to the advisory board.	4.715424919011072
6603. referring further to the foundation's officers dr	james f mathias for eleven years our discerning colleague as	associate secretary was promoted to be secretary.	3.9126358397780323
6604. he is a historian	with the great merit of a historian's long view.	7.1942860595041545
6605. also appointed	to the foundation's staff as assistant secretary is mr	j kellum smith jr.	4.652261509300707
6606. mr smith like the present secretary	general is a lawyer; and lawyers- with the great virtues	that they are trained to read the fine print carefully and are	able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions	to difficult problems in many fields- are indispensable even in a foundation	office.	4.876351654707575
6607. the present secretary general has been the	foundation's principal administrative officer continuously since the	foundation's establishment thirty-five years ago.	4.03962495138101
6608. but even he will	not last indefinitely and the above-noted new arrangements are quite	simply made to assure qualitative continuity in the foundation's	policies and practices.	5.458769907943132
6609. the effective recognition of excellence and	its nurture has to be learned and is not learned in a day nor even	in a year.	4.271797793719789
6610. we are not given to lamentations neither personally	nor in these reports.	7.943506744648829
6611. on the contrary if this be an apocalyptic	era as is commonly said we see it as an era of opportunity.	4.7221800276425245
6612. for	granting that there are great present-day problems to be solved these	problems make great demands; and by their demanding tend to create	resources of men's minds and hearts which problems with easy answers	do not bring forth.	4.915845732117427
6613. of this examples are legion: pericles speaking	his funeral oration in ancient greece's extremity after thermopylae	and making it a testament of freedom; jefferson writing the	declaration of independence amid the catastrophes of revolution;	christ preaching the sermon on the mount close to his ultimate sacrifice;	shakespeare speaking with the indescribable gusto of the	elizabethan voice- keats's words- in the days of the spanish	armada's threats; isaac newton at the age of twenty-three	industriously calculating logarithms to two and fifty places during	the great plague year in england 1665; winston churchill's	olympian optimistic and resolute sayings when britain stood alone	against the armed forces of tyranny less than twenty years ago; the	present-day explorations of outer space answering age-old questions	of science and philosophy in the face of possible wars of extinction.	3.4775793756594546
6614. forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit as the roman poet	virgil declared with much more historical sense than most writers	of today.	5.160513208686437
6615. it gives indeed cause for rejoicing to remember what many	catastrophes of the past produced; and it is to be noted also that	confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared	in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind.	4.220337100432756
6616. for example out of the social evils of the english industrial	revolution came the novels of charles dickens; and his genius	moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all western men-	until today- in the industrialized west these social evils	substantially do not exist.	5.265944105799031
6617. the solutions were not arrived at by any	theoreticians of the karl marx stripe but by men of government- lawyers	most of them- and men of business.	3.540600977135349
6618. these were educated men	who as mr justice holmes was fond of saying formed their inductions	out of experience under the burden of responsibility.	5.5563050522599715
6619. that is	to put it realistically they had to run their businesses at a profit	or they had to get the votes to get elected.	4.490416656030654
6620. nevertheless they made	naught of marx's prophecy that capitalism would never pay the workers-	to use marx's word- more than a subsistence wage with	the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its	way into the capitalists' pockets with the result in turn that the	gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery	of the poor increase.	4.7353236791743045
6621. but as all understand who have eyes	to see nothing of the kind has happened; indeed the contrary has	happened.	4.655350912549271
6622. the gulf between the rich and the poor has narrowed	in the industrialized western world to the point that the word	poor is hardly applicable.	5.201204537477738
6623. and the reason this could happen is	clear: men of government business men lawyers and all who concerned	themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their	concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of	freedom and opportunity.	3.7313604275060768
6624. some would say that they were not permitted	to run their businesses only for profit; and even putting it that	way would not prove that marx was anything but wrong.	5.670824586095048
6625. sir henry	sumner maine a hundred years before communism was a force to be	reckoned with wrote his brilliant legal generalization that the	progress of society is from status to contract.	3.7926219827352505
6626. the essence of contract	is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not	do.	6.007215445176732
6627. hence the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice.	5.110726632091657
6628. the greater the range of freedom for individual men the greater	the range of choice; the greater the range of choice the greater	the rate of change.	5.316074882533905
6629. for change is dependent on the possibilities that	individual men glimpse for the future.	4.983740533146882
6630. but when there is not freedom	and opportunity to choose men- individual men- must remain in status	and society does not cannot progress.	6.161622664695081
6631. the eternal truth	is that progress- due as it always is to individual creative genius-	is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the	beating of the heart.	3.4642567743409387
6632. and lest anybody think that considerations	such as these are not germane in a foundation report let me enlighten	them with the truths that under communism there would have been	no capital with which to endow the foundation and that there would	not be that individual freedom within which the fellows might proceed	untrammeled in every way toward their discoveries their creative	efforts for the good of mankind.	4.870583868420237
6633. during the year 1959	we granted 354 fellowships; in 1960 we granted 334.	5.391949965348877
6634. as heretofore	our fellowships are available to assist research in all fields of	knowledge and creative effort in all the arts.	6.175497827079075
6635. we do not favor one field	over another: we think that all inquiry all scholarly and artistic	creation is good- provided only that it contributes to a sense	and understanding of the true ends of life as all first-rate scholarship	and artistic creation does.	4.077304018992075
6636. indeed if pressed we would say what	the late robert henri american painter said to a pupil anything	will do for a subject: it's what you do with it that counts.	5.355038768229942
6637. thus we have no part and want none in current discussions	of the relative importance of science the social studies the humanities	the creative arts.	4.2774234168139165
6638. we want no part in such discussions because	we think them largely futile; and we think them largely futile because	for true excellence of accomplishment every scholar and every	artist must cross boundaries of knowledge and boundaries of points of	view.	4.982242050514858
6639. when the brown + sharpe manufacturing company reached its	125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 it became an almost	unique institution in the mechanical world.	3.9604899507606004
6640. with its history	standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution	brown + sharpe has become over the years a singular monument	to the mechanical foresight of its founder joseph r brown and	a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology.	5.064908200443816
6641. joseph r brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise	of new england between 1810 and 1830.	4.475325344765706
6642. he was early exposed to	the mechanical world and in his youth often helped his father david	brown master clock and watchmaker as he plied his trade.	5.38554865407053
6643. at the	age of 17 he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of walcott +	harris in valley falls rhode island and following two or three	other jobs in quick succession after graduation he went into business	for himself in 1831 making lathes and small tools.	3.535055955687678
6644. this enterprise	led to a father-and-son combination beginning in 1833 under the name	d brown + son a business which eventually grew into the modern	corporation we now call brown + sharpe.	4.835778582113481
6645. the years of joseph's	partnership with his father were numbered.	4.915149536450179
6646. in 1838 a devastating	fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter david brown moved	west to illinois settling on a land grant in his declining years.	5.034535399228868
6647. joseph brown continued in business by himself quickly rebuilding	the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those	first steps which were to establish him as a pioneer in raising the	standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world.	3.7322505831215196
6648. much of his genius of course sprang from his familiarity with	clock movements.	6.783617006423975
6649. during these early years the repair of watches and	clocks and the building of special clocks for church steeples formed	an important part of the young man's occupation.	4.462029135088973
6650. he became particularly	interested in graduating and precision measurement during the 1840's	and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during	this period.	5.368619595951285
6651. but his business also grew and we are told that mr	brown found it	increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his	creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire.	4.043711726526524
6652. it must have	been with some pleasure and relief that on september 12 1848 joseph	brown made the momentous entry in his job book in his characteristically	cryptic style lucian sharpe came to work for me this day	as an apprentice.	5.03842756883523
6653. the young apprentice apparently did well	by mr brown for in the third year of his apprenticeship lucian	was offered a full partnership in the firm; the company became j	r brown + sharpe and entered into a new and important	period of its development.	3.8204185844998078
6654. mr sharpe's arrival in the business	did indeed provide what mr brown had most coveted- time for tinkering	and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those	developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that	time.	5.252085779296424
6655. by 1853 the new partnership announced the precision	vernier caliper as the first fruit of their joint efforts.	4.6745299156181765
6656. the basic	significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in 1855	by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing	engine.	5.131803526523291
6657. that development in turn formed the foundation of still more	significant expansions in later years- in gear cutting in circular	graduating in index drilling and in many other fields where accuracy	was a paramount requirement.	3.7128913213837444
6658. throughout their careers both	mr brown and mr sharpe were interested in the problem of setting	up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades.	6.30707358867085
6659. several	efforts were made in this direction and though not all of them survive	to this day the brown + sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted	as the american standard and is still in common use today.	3.9846401456827842
6660. as one development followed another the company's reputation for	precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities	for expansion in precision manufacture.	5.271897011214115
6661. in 1858 the partnership	began manufacturing the willcox + gibbs sewing machine.	4.742197349412644
6662. as the story goes mr gibbs who originally came from the back	counties of the commonwealth of virginia saw an illustration in a	magazine of the famous howe sewing machine.	5.674650468490449
6663. curious as to what made	it work he built a crude model of it in wood and filed a piece of steel	until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread enabling	the crude machine to take stitches.	3.8791857067977378
6664. when he showed this model as his	solution as to how the howe sewing machine operated he was	told he was wrong and discovered to his amazement that the howe	machine which was unknown to him in detail used two threads while	the one that he had perfected used only one.	5.296678998985319
6665. thus was invented the	single thread sewing machine which mr gibbs in partnership with	mr willcox decided to bring to brown + sharpe with the proposal	that the small company undertake its manufacture.	3.706119061034101
6666. the new work	was a boon to the partnership not only for its own value but particularly	for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of j r	brown toward yet further developments for production equipment.	5.141779729483408
6667. the turret screw machine now known as the brown + sharpe hand	screw machine takes its ancestry directly from mr brown's efforts	to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing	machine.	3.8177337364971935
6668. mr brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine	design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret	by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock and reversible	tap and die holders.	5.167973913694062
6669. in 1861 mr brown's attention	was called to yet another basic production problem- the manufacture	of twist drills.	4.197910220104564
6670. at that time during the civil war union muskets	were being manufactured in providence and the drills to drill them	were being hand-filed with rattail files.	6.221528343341205
6671. this process neither satisfied	the urgent production schedules nor mr brown's imagination	of the possibilities in the situation.	4.2525908972579245
6672. the child of this problem was	mr brown's famous serial no 1 universal milling machine	the archtype from which is descended today's universal knee-type	milling machine used throughout the world.	4.831790232223155
6673. the original machine bearing	its famous serial number is still on exhibition at the brown + sharpe	precision center in providence.	3.857090307923501
6674. during the civil war	period mr brown also invented the brown + sharpe formed tooth	gear cutter a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the world's	gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics.	5.165855015528541
6675. up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear	teeth but they were good for only one sharpening.	4.608417030626148
6676. as soon as the	time came for re-sharpening the precise form of the gear tooth was lost	and a new cutter had to be made.	6.099486385151695
6677. this process made the economical	manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit	the repeated re-sharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss	of the precision form.	3.623144432688742
6678. mr brown's invention achieved this and	as a byproduct formed the cornerstone of brown + sharpe's position	of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until	the 1920's when superceded by other methods.	4.841065215222533
6679. the micrometer	caliper as a common workshop tool also owes much to j r brown.	3.991360822643165
6680. although mr brown was not himself its inventor	it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance	of mass producing this basic tool for general use.	5.263448575947424
6681. so it was	that when mr brown and mr sharpe first saw the french tool	on exhibition in paris in 1868 they brought a sample with them to the	united states and started brown + sharpe in yet another field where	it retains its leadership to this day.	3.5881644275423707
6682. the final achievement	of mr brown's long and interesting mechanical career runs a	close second in importance to his development of the universal milling	machine.	5.360545175752686
6683. that achievement was his creation of the universal grinding	machine which made its appearance in 1876 at the philadelphia centennial	exposition.	4.165196044658232
6684. this machine like its milling counterpart was	the antecedent of a machine-family used to this very day in precision	metalworking shops throughout the world.	5.183437337510168
6685. along with j r brown's	other major developments the universal grinding machine was profoundly	influential in setting the course of brown + sharpe for many	years to come.	4.136351589490087
6686. following mr brown's death there came	forward in the brown + sharpe organization many other men who contributed	greatly to the development of the company.	6.013368287007806
6687. one such man was samuel	darling.	7.990669676751336
6688. as head of the firm darling + swartz mr	darling began by challenging brown + sharpe to its keenest competition	during the 1850's and early 60's.	5.84152353241309
6689. in 1868 however a truce	was called between the companies and the partnership of darling brown	+ sharpe was formed.	4.060816172838175
6690. between that year and the buying out of mr	darling's interest in 1892 a large portion of the company's precision	tool business was carried out under the name of darling brown	+ sharpe and to this day many old precision tools are in use still	bearing that famous trademark.	5.171557459245469
6691. perhaps the outstanding standard	bearer of mr brown's tradition for accuracy was mr oscar	j beale whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of	mr brown and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly	accurate measuring machinery that enabled brown + sharpe	to manufacture gages and therefore its products with an accuracy exceeding	anything then available elsewhere in the world.	3.616209978606658
6692. also important	on the brown + sharpe scene at the turn of the century was	mr richmond viall works superintendent of the company from	1876 to 1910.	6.2173757926825965
6693. mr viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership	and development of men.	4.855576152371108
6694. he was an ardent champion of the brown	+ sharpe apprentice program and personal counselor to countless able	men who first developed their industrial talents with the company.	5.367895040438286
6695. in one sense it can be said that one of the most important brown + sharpe	products over the years has been the men who began work with the	company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout	the nation and even abroad.	5.1121599909796025
6696. commencing with the death of	lucian sharpe in 1899 the name of henry d sharpe was for more	than 50 years closely interwoven with the destiny of the company.	5.310088739516755
6697. during	his presidency the company's physical plant was enormously expanded	and the length and breadth of the brown + sharpe machine tool	line became the greatest in the world.	3.854223481982572
6698. during the early part of this	century the brown + sharpe works in providence were unchallenged	as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to	precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world.	5.541288018773964
6699. during these years the company's product line followed the basic tenets	laid down by mr brown.	4.965387517891601
6700. it expanded from hand screw machines	to automatic screw machines from simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines	to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing	business from rudimentary belt-driven universal milling machines to	a broad line of elaborately controlled knee-type and manufacturing type	milling machines.	4.751609680148722
6701. in the grinding machine field expansion went far	from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders surface	grinders and a wide variety of special and semi-special models.	4.01339663839761
6702. in 1951 henry d sharpe jr succeeded his father and	continued	the company's development as a major factor in the metal-working	equipment business.	5.874674454412075
6703. the company is still broadening its line and	is now active on four major fronts.	4.3488593696246935
6704. the machine tool division	is currently producing brown + sharpe single spindle automatic screw	machines grinding machines of many types and knee and bed-type	milling machines.	4.812281899547261
6705. recently added is the brown + sharpe turret drilling	machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool	development.	4.128003184536013
6706. in the industrial products division the company	manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection	equipment machinists' tools- including micrometers vernier	calipers and accessories.	5.168882230108415
6707. in the cutting tool division	the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling	cutters end mills and saws.	4.348288352734535
6708. sales and net income for the year ended december 31 1960 showed an	improvement over 1959.	5.979837756059499
6709. net income was $2557111 or $3.	6.299465328169385
6710. 11 per share	on 821220 common shares currently outstanding as compared to $2323867	or $2.	5.7836982265615156
6711. 82 per share in 1959 adjusted to the same number of shares.	5.495605376107833
6712. sales and other operating income increased 25.	7.1581511048922275
6713. 1% from $24926615	in 1959 to $31179816 in 1960.	5.066959048406199
6714. this increase was sufficient to	overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and	increased expenditures on research and development.	5.240857514517342
6715. in spite	of the fact that our largest market the textile industry was affected	substantially by the current decline in business activity we have	been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960	at a rate materially higher than during 1959.	3.837946641392016
6716. year	our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and	unless this trend can be reversed our production for 1961 will be lower	than for 1960.	5.060503973016111
6717. however the healthy inventory position of	the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that	improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961.	4.523174670486911
6718. in connection with our continuing	development of new and more efficient mill machinery a sounder u	s income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment enabling	the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic	basis could if adopted have favorable effects on leesona's	business in the next few years.	5.03807210738171
6719. such a depreciation policy would	also we believe prove a very important factor in strengthening the	competitive position of the u s textile and other industries	thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange.	4.590030083010193
6720. our research and development program	serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost	production throughout the world continues to have primary emphasis	at leesona.	5.793012130985518
6721. this program is based on the policy of designing	and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile	values- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality fashion and utility	provide the consumer with better textile products for the money.	4.065480799612717
6722. such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing	mill equipment in terms of efficiency and versatility.	6.786673197847763
6723. but more important	we believe it must concentrate on the development of entirely	new concepts in textile processing as do the unifil loom winder and	our more recent uniconer automatic coning machine.	4.1626250340687205
6724. on this basis our already substantial budget for research and	development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance	the continuing engineering and design work essential to leesona's	future growth in sales and earnings.	5.709020793009983
6725. much of this necessary	increase in research and development though properly chargeable to	current expenses is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed	and the new machines sold in quantity usually over a period of	several years.	3.9987195638633968
6726. in december we began to	ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines.	6.595164452509822
6727. these machines produce	the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured	fabrics.	4.520721815005004
6728. during the past year great progress has been made by	the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics.	6.969011079890383
6729. fashion	centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and	improved wash and wear dresses and blouses made from these fabrics.	3.841511969386553
6730. this machine operating at speeds up to 350000 revolutions	per minute is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations	in industry today.	6.005190171264682
6731. it transfers yarn directly from the producers'	largest package into ideal supply packages for use on unifil loom	winders in weaving stretch yarn fabrics.	3.9970340573055543
6732. our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing	well in our customers' mills.	5.909404648668245
6733. later in the year additional types	of this leesona twister will be made available to mills for other	man-made fibers and natural yarns.	4.925344131713548
6734. these machines are designed to provide	higher operating speeds larger yarn packages and greater flexibility	of application to different types of yarn.	5.97877278107133
6735. this we believe will	substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment.	4.9479277137166
6736. major activity at providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled	completion of tooling for production of the uniconer automatic	coning machine.	5.5259450784362745
6737. this work is progressing on schedule and we expect to	make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year.	4.384779445082416
6738. this machine	was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and	was well received by the industry.	6.055004051939889
6739. the potential market for the machine	should be comparable to that of the unifil loom winder.	4.728025358315809
6740. the	uniconer has several outstanding features- it operates with much	greater efficiency than existing equipment; it incorporates an automatic	knot-tying device on each spindle and it will knot a break in	the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end	is exhausted.	4.825073764033928
6741. because the bobin-to-cone winding process is a	relatively high-cost operation for the mill the almost complete automation	provided by the uniconer can mean important economies in textile	production at the same time upgrading quality.	4.1601749696286765
6742. many mills have already	placed firm orders for this machine.	7.377347783929916
6743. a new application for the unifil loom winder running single filling	for box looms will broaden mill use of this equipment.	4.296786307021976
6744. machines	a new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate	the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic	yarns.	5.630480193705887
6745. it is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to	hold precise tension and speed.	5.074764968189516
6746. this new machine takes up filament	yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds	up to 6000 feet per minute.	5.378534952103228
6747. it is equipped with an automatic threading	device to reduce waste and handling time.	4.940841999763811
6748. our take-up machines	and our twister-coners are undergoing important pilot plant testing	for application with new high polymer yarns in several fiber producing	plants.	5.353969017239368
6749. we look forward to a stronger position in this expanding	field.	5.7360472552532515
6750. we are interested in further diversification	into other fields of capital goods or components for industrial	products and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction.	5.503649116082829
6751. our patterson moos research	division has made further very encouraging progress in development of	fuel cells.	4.502593804153276
6752. the cooperation of our exclusive american licensee pratt	+ whitney aircraft division of united aircraft corporation	has been important in this work.	4.937706492416149
6753. in addition to its major effort on fuel	cells patterson moos research division is continuing to carry	on research in other fields both under contract for the defense department	other government agencies and for our own account.	3.893987951650043
6754. pmr	is currently supplying components vital to the titan and minuteman	programs.	6.549578918263135
6755. we have recently entered into an agreement with compagnie	generale de telegraphie sans fil of france for	the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials.	4.043768940672188
6756. the agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing	of such materials in the united states.	6.0649274094314265
6757. initially we will import the	thermoelectric materials and modules from france but later we will	manufacture in this country.	4.016603894825618
6758. there is a rapidly growing demand for this	material primarily from the military.	7.137348981141772
6759. further research we believe	will develop important commercial applications.	5.671075026644903
6760. a project for	the air force has been completed in which the nair infrared	detecting device was developed for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous	gases.	5.502718796537227
6761. we are initiating research on the use of solid state	materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require	cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity.	4.373497469704282
6762. the rapid	advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation.	5.506908456901043
6763. our plan is to keep abreast of these advances and select for development	those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities.	3.9676895465760027
6764. early in august we broke ground	for a new $3500000 plant in warwick rhode island which will house	our textile and coil winding machinery operations.	5.35765809855738
6765. construction is	well along and the plant is scheduled for completion in november of	this year.	4.362455938901517
6766. all operations now carried on at our plant at cranston will	be transferred to warwick.	6.114230726657318
6767. operations in the new plant should be	producing efficiently early in 1962.	5.305964674276635
6768. an architect's sketch	of the new plant is shown on the front cover.	6.900383412262205
6769. the building will contain	430000 square feet approximately the same as our present plant.	4.368616705979273
6770. however	its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production	capacity permit more efficient manufacturing and substantially	reduce current repair and maintenance costs.	5.5073707088263815
6771. a major consideration	in the choice of the warwick site four miles from cranston was	the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly	skilled work force.	4.115825355615555
6772. we have entered into an agreement for the	sale of the present cranston properties effective as soon as we have	completed removal to our new plant.	6.311130876544061
6773. during	the year our british subsidiary leesona-holt limited expanded	its plant in darwen england and added machine tool capacity.	4.200843690280139
6774. the	operations of its other plant in rochdale and leesona's former operations	in manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant	in the adjoining town of heywood.	4.96038068518468
6775. layout and equipment were modernized	and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis.	4.21292691591616
6776. the area available at heywood is approximately three times the size	of the former rochdale and manchester locations.	5.3122274618760175
6777. in addition land	has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future.	5.285477850663984
6778. the new warwick plant is being built	at our expense and under our direction.	6.021268394991055
6779. it will be transfered on	completion to the industrial foundation of rhode island a non-profit	organization which will reimburse us for the cost of construction.	4.845418406315741
6780. we will then occupy the new plant under lease with an option to purchase.	6.388544355172079
6781. these arrangements are in our opinion very favorable to leesona.	5.143243738066839
6782. interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short	term loan from the chase manhattan bank.	5.604008141189017
6783. in addition to expenditures	on the warwick plant we have invested approximately $1961000	for machinery and equipment at cranston and for new machinery	plant and equipment at leesona-holt limited.	4.000692490864224
6784. we believe that these	improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which	will fully justify the investment.	6.120293778865453
6785. long term loans have been	reduced by $395000 to $2461000.	5.503200214535526
6786. inventories increased $625561 to	$8313514 during the year and should decline in coming months.	6.1310399746151925
6787. thus	we enter 1961 in a strong financial position.	5.066959048406199
6788. in accordance with the two-year contract signed in may 1959 with	the international association of machinists afl-cio wages	of hourly employees were increased by 4% in may 1960 and pay levels	for non-exempt salaried employees were increased proportionately.	5.06354420966713
6789. in addition blue cross coverage for all employees and their dependents	was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital	accommodations.	4.452981520496502
6790. in addition to direct salaries	and wages the company paid or accrued during the year the following	amounts for the benefit of employees:    during the pension	year ended december 31 1960 23 employees retired making a total	of 171 currently retired under the company's pension plan.	5.142116360165087
6791. at	december 13 1960 the fund held by the industrial national bank of	providence as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions	to qualified members of the plan totaled $2412616.	4.162674816198556
6792. the basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of	the population that began 20 years ago.	5.3585963359444
6793. another growth factor is increased	consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics	that go with a rising standard of living.	3.9606173010294836
6794. as in many other	industries rising costs and intense competition both domestic and	foreign have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry	in recent years.	5.671123689609544
6795. in textiles as elsewhere	a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and	higher productivity.	5.11711231130032
6796. as a designer and manufacturer of textile	production machinery leesona and other companies in its industry have	sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods	that would increase production yet maintain both quality and flexibility.	4.870673555867006
6797. the problem of efficient	production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves	large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel	or home decoration.	4.302211372814826
6798. production must be adjusted accordingly at	minimum cost and quickly.	6.522871687113793
6799. in addition production machinery must	in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural	fibers and the increasing number of synthetics as well as blends.	4.4690666966124155
6800. following the term of service in japan each emissary returns for a	brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college	community.	5.789634126283363
6801. the carleton service fund provides the financial support	for this program.	4.200697917275358
6802. the college was one	of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite	part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life.	6.407639593671836
6803. extensive	facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining under	skilled direction the choir the orchestra the band the glee	club and smaller ensembles of wind and string players.	3.6345709407778486
6804. all	students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations	for which they qualify.	6.8923711074853395
6805. orchestra band and choir have auditions	during the week preceding the first day of classes.	4.551032908172401
6806. the glee club	is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for	membership.	5.201929906662087
6807. in addition to the many appearances of these organizations	throughout the college year there are concerts by students of	the music department by members of the music faculty and by visiting	artists.	4.516017537161782
6808. student musical organizations are the knights of	carleton and the overtones and the keynotes	.	6.025755741243995
6809. these student-directed organizations include	eight to ten members each; they perform at many campus social	events.	4.411633295274241
6810. from the founding of the college	those responsible for its management have planned to provide its	students favorable conditions for personal religious development and to	offer opportunities through the curriculum and otherwise for understanding	the meaning and importance of religion.	4.899829241498777
6811. courses are offered in	ethics the philosophy and history of religion christian thought and	history and the bible.	4.060235568763422
6812. carleton aims throughout its entire teaching	program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute	to the moral and religious development of its students.	5.35225900531314

6891. week-end activities for the entire	campus are planned by the co-op board.	4.535752126583474
6892. in recent months much attention has been given to the probable	extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat	divided as to the outlook for the near future.	6.27156218268738
6893. and yet despite some	disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new	decade 1960 has been a good year in many ways with many overall measures	of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole.	4.258408533568892
6894. the	shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the	present mood of caution has probably been a good thing in that it has	prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized	many previous swings in the business cycle.	5.356104299762955
6895. this caution	has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors	to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier and the fact	stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because	of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level.	3.589388199939545
6896. in	the electronics industry this tendency is well illustrated by inventories	of tv sets.	6.535873375185394
6897. factory stocks in recent months have been the	highest they have been in three years while those at retail are below	1959.	4.826244561094771
6898. the total value of our industry's shipments at factory prices	increased from $9.	5.738615748496538
6899. 2 billion in 1959 to approximately $10.	6.243322178843379
6900. 1 billion	as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business-	home entertainment military industrial and replacement.	7.811994562706156
6901. i believe	a further gain is in prospect for 1961.	5.2647744347694285
6902. up	reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as	consoles and combinations since 1953 dollar value of home entertainment	electronics in 1960 was about $1.	5.004173005508399
6903. 9 billion compared to $1.	6.321259792119907
6904. sales of tv sets at retail ran ahead of the like months	of 1959 through july; set production	also ran ahead in the early months but was curtailed	after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence	that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic.	5.547035475729583
6905. for the year as a whole retail sales of tv sets probably came	to 5.	5.711492841382814
6906. 7 million in 1959; however production came	to only 5.	6.91484675287188
6907. 6 million compared to 6.	6.234555997570527
6908. in contrast to the	lower turnout of tv total radio production increased from 15.	6.451727817754432
6909. 4	million sets to 16.	6.683325264329536
6910. both home and auto	radios were in excellent demand with retail sales of home sets ahead	of 1959 in every month of the first eleven; sales and production of	home sets were about equal at 10.	5.323390155496995
6911. auto set production	came to about 6.	5.66037853959279
6912. 3 million compared to 5.	9.89519921835381
6913. separate	phonographs also had a good year reflecting the growing popularity of	stereo	sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade	that characterized the radio-tv market.	4.285134980734421
6914. the outlook	for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present	but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers	to step up their buying plans for durable goods.	4.963828601245137
6915. i would expect that	sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some	10-15% but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison	with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business	conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will.	4.116040120012498
6916. i	look for tv sales and production to be approximately equal at 5.	5.926734816808145
6917. 7	million sets for the year but i look for some decline in radios from	the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15.	3.8364125853910616
6918. i therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop	in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $1.	5.667420566924127
6919. 8	million slightly below 1960 but above 1959.	5.3285636594893
6920. to grow	1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's	shipments of military electronics which totalled about $5.	5.9008145654138975
6921. 4 billion	compared to $4.	7.899558620645233
6922. it is interesting to note that	the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than	the industry's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953 which were good	years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period	of rapid consumer acceptance.	4.799721643436545
6923. it has been correctly pointed out by well-informed	people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to	expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15% or better that characterized	the decade of the 1950's and that our military markets	may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons	systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas	of our defense capability.	3.7434454507167114
6924. while this may well be true in general i	believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments	suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be	one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding	rapidly in other directions.	5.506628135212308
6925. among the items scheduled	for acceleration in the near future are the polaris and b70	programs strengthening of the airborne alert system of the strategic	air command and improved battlefield surveillance systems.	4.11294247892669
6926. research	and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite	samos and the future development of ballistic missile	defense systems such as nike-zeus are expected to increase substantially.	5.499431140762719
6927. research development test and evaluation funds devoted	to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft	and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement	by 1963.	3.84991835289763
6928. still later the realm of space technology will show	substantial gains; it has been estimated that spending by the national	aeronautics and space administration will rise from less than	$500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967 and that	the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer	to 50% than the current 20%.	4.914765952553577
6929. the stepped up defense procurement	called for in the 1961 budget has already begun to make itself	felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and	the components that go into it and it has been suggested that an additional	$2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested	for fiscal 1962.	3.5178872451323295
6930. although the impact of these increases on our industry's	shipments will be gradual on balance i look for another good	increase in shipments in the coming year to at least $6 billion.	5.693384922875915
6931. electronic equipment	paced by the continuing rapid growth	of electronic data processing sales of industrial and commercial electronic	equipment totalled $1.	4.137654203574391
6932. 8 billion compared to $1.	9.338132161006708
6933. the market for computers and other data-handling continues to expand	at the rate of about 30% annually reaching some $450 million in	1960.	3.8393943513088558
6934. informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple	by the late 1960's under the stimulus of new applications in	the fields of banking and retailing industrial process control and information	storage and retrieval.	4.730440064775632
6935. in the industrial field prospects	for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment	are also quite bright.	4.301159150782322
6936. for the near term however it must be realized	that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive	to general business conditions than is the military market and for this	reason i would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller	than those of recent years; sales should slightly exceed 1960 however	and reach $1.	4.804990526275146
6937. in addition to	the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business	the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues	year by year.	4.266345225353062
6938. this is now a $1.	10.466989418772055
6939. 0 billion business up from $0.	5.66037853959279
6940. 9 billion	in 1959 and should reach $1.	7.274484825381194
6941. the markets	for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of	the various end equipment segments of the industry.	3.6398110151839265
6942. demand for parts	for home entertainment was strong in the first half but purchases were	cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced	their own operating rates.	5.437702310420726
6943. in the military field incoming orders turned	down early in the year and remained rather slow until late fall	when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt	in rising orders for components.	4.0637858424904
6944. sales of transistors in 1960	exceeded $300 million compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial	price reductions in virtually all types.	5.160513208686437
6945. production totalled about	123 million units against 82 million in 1959 and i look for a further	gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961.	3.9865121443471945
6946. sales of passive components such as capacitors and resistors although	not growing as fast as those of semi-conductors were ahead of	1959 this year and should increase again in 1961.	5.011451731546987
6947. in sum i	look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 with	total sales increasing about 7% to $10.	4.1447098836475424
6948. 8 billion despite the uncertainties	in the business outlook generally.	7.1451289291142634
6949. as i have indicated above	i base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market	for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of	the year but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on	to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960; on prospects	for continued increases in defense spending; and on continued growth	in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing	and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's.	3.4721877049935594
6950. the appointment of gilbert b devey as general manager	of vectrol engineering inc of stamford connecticut a leading	manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical	controls has been announced by david b peck vice president	special products.	4.796296762626929

6963. he	is a member of the institution of electrical engineers london a	registered professional engineer in connecticut and ohio and a chartered	electrical engineer in great britain.	4.231391395555232
6964. the promotion of robert e swift to the position of assistant	manager of the interference control field service department	was announced early in december by frederick s scarborough	manager of interference control field service.	4.7766711980419725
6965. the appointment was	made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers	of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability	problems.	3.8911400159391802
6966. between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters.	6.378309054468754
6967. since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential	aide one person with adequate staff assistance could fill both	jobs.	4.672016897770936
6968. since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals	rather than as employees enthusiasm in a common enterprise is	proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing	in the decisions that govern its course.	5.385494529350893
6969. the faculty	believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching	and scholarship.	4.123397313054659
6970. the president expects faculty members to remember	in exercising their autonomy that they share no collective responsibility	for the university's income nor are they personally accountable	for top-level decisions.	5.0948644438114306
6971. he may welcome their appropriate participation	in the determination of high policy but he has a right to	expect in return that they will leave administrative matters to the	administration.	4.224679571455124
6972. how well do faculty members govern themselves?	8.866762127259614
6973. 	there is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought	to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in	government.	4.211678615748421
6974. they sometimes pay more attention to their rights than	to their own internal problems of government.	5.962577922418161
6975. they too need to learn	to delegate.	6.5568909105064925
6976. letting the administration take details off their hands	would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a	whole an area that would benefit by more faculty attention.	4.9549885378876946
6977. although	faculties insist on governing themselves they grant little prestige	to a member who actively participates in college or university	government.	3.9394316778493597
6978. there are nevertheless several things that the president	can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those	who are willing to exercise their privilege.	5.841461681889478
6979. he can for example	present significant university-wide issues to the senate.	5.430182391664602
6980. he can encourage	quality in faculty committee work in various ways: by seeing to	it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as	well as the action-oriented faculty; by making certain that no faculty	member has too many committee assignments; by assuring good liaison	between the committees and the administration; by minimizing the	number of committees.	4.7229296532977445
6981. despite the many avenues for the exchange	of ideas between faculty and administration complaints of a lack	of communication persist.	4.363548535995097
6982. the cause is as often neglect as hesitance	to disclose.	5.803819556908879
6983. a busy president conversant with a problem and its ramifications	and beset by pressures to meet deadlines tends naturally to	assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is.	3.556372274792424
6984. the	need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all	methods of consultation.	5.682803856238644
6985. to increase faculty influence and decrease	tension many presidents have established a standing advisory	committee with which they can discuss problems frankly.	4.405417825144461
6986. the president	has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes but if	he looks ahead two three or five years to anticipate issues and throw	out challenging ideas he can open the way for innovation and he can	also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take.	4.9234197397775405
6987. success	will require tact sensitivity to faculty prerogatives patience and	persistence.	4.855658467968249
6988. the critical task for every president and his	academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university	continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance	will match changing social demands h great professors do not automatically	reproduce themselves.	4.567815306663953
6989. deans can form an important bridge	between the president and the faculty.	5.380377620186073
6990. they serve not only as spokesmen	for their areas but they also contribute to top-level decision	making.	6.236701154981001
6991. the president who appoints strong men who have an all-college	or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration	can count on useful assistance.	4.200529102134982
6992. faculty members depend on	their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration.	5.7836982265615156
6993. the administration at the same time looks to the chairmen	for strategic aid in building stronger departments.	4.859332520756231
6994. one way that this	can be done other than by hiring new high-priced professors is by constantly	encouraging the department members to raise their standards	of performance.	5.46933244328291
6995. the quality of a president's leadership is	measured first by his success in building up the faculty.	4.278429705104339
6996. by supporting	the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever	higher standards the president can encourage faculty leadership.	6.181462612017845
6997. indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for	appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to.	3.7992019768996257
6998. the academic dean should take a direct long-term interest in faculty	development.	5.699814805913631
6999. an alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel	needs plans for the future qualifications of those on the job	and bright prospects elsewhere.	4.301386392960679
7000. for the maintenance of a long-term	program the departments and particularly their chairmen are	strategic.	7.138557704995048
7001. they evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment and	promotion.	5.426986453472578
7002. to provide an independent judgment for the president the	academic dean also investigates candidates thoroughly.	6.0082614894443624
7003. at some	colleges and universities a faculty committee reviews and reports	to the administration on the qualifications of candidates.	4.346039284052612
7004. some faculty	members and many administrators oppose faculty review groups because	they either repeat department's actions or act pro forma.	5.553412202534195
7005. they	can be effective however if their members set high standards for candidates	and devote substantial time to the work.	3.9394316778493597
7006. at one university	the president cites the faculty review committee as a valued partner	of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the	faculty.	6.0829994444647575
7007. before the president recommends a candidate to the	trustees the administration collects the views of colleagues in the	same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere.	4.240685310748062
7008. the president or dean	reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation	of the quality of his mind.	6.4535146517291935
7009. no good way to evaluate teaching ability	has yet been discovered although some institutions use inventory sheets	for a list of criteria.	4.4630106629929305
7010. to avoid passing over quiet unaggressive	teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion review	of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should	be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for	advancement by their departments.	5.890126689167256
7011. there are certain aspects of	personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly.	5.122468766479439
7012. he should personally consider the potential of a faculty member	proposed for tenure to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly	serious commitment turn solely upon the man's former achievements.	5.130032991870746
7013. no one can be as effective as the president in inspiring older	men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to	their specialties is quite different.	4.150679372835362
7014. in particular the president	may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members	to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale.	5.19942819813591
7015. on	those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the	standards of the institution the president must also bear the ultimate	burden of decision and action.	3.7035949859289805
7016. a true university like most	successful marriages is a unity of diversities h without forcing	all components into a single pattern the preparation of a master plan	is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest	level which a university- in contrast to a multiversity- should	stand for.	4.739798395700473
7017. recently colleges and universities have begun	to translate their educational philosophy into institution-wide goals.	4.867758596725017
7018. each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as:	shall we require a liberal education built around a humanities core	for all undergraduates?	5.496870818721875
7019.  or shall we permit early specialization in	scientific and technological subjects?	5.385819315566036
7020.  in the first instance adequate	appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be	planned.	7.465223240723889
7021. in the second more shops laboratories and staff will be required.	5.426505155154317
7022. for the president a master plan looking ahead five years	offers several practical	advantages.	6.846951631121866
7023. trustees faculty and administration can consider the	consequences of decisions before they are made instead of afterwards.	4.5057234448255015
7024. physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed.	7.196662262052178
7025. proposed	new programs can be examined for appropriateness to goals and for present	and future financial fitness.	4.131860641767443
7026. more than one president has found	that a long-range plan helps him to attract major gifts.	6.819076588908376
7027. it inspires	confidence in his institution's determination to establish goals and	to achieve them.	4.871507631914194
7028. before deciding where it is going however	a college	or university must know where it is.	7.314680235778237
7029. the first step is a comprehensive	self study made by faculty by outside consultants or by a combination	of the two.	4.3623080636056395
7030. it should sternly appraise curricula faculty organization	buildings faculty work loads and potential for growth in	stature and size.	6.124656729921705
7031. implementation of the master plan will inevitably	be uneven.	5.227253626573086
7032. some departments will attack their new goals enthusiastically;	others may drag their feet.	6.332890701313952
7033. funds may be readily donated	for some purposes but not others.	4.795697993606368
7034. a plan must therefore be brought	up to date periodically possibly with the assistance of a permanent	planning officer.	5.414015520806997
7035. to provide the continuous flow of information	basic to administrative decisions a number of institutions have established	offices of institutional research.	4.78739134629437
7036. some offices have very broad	responsibilities touching on almost all aspects of a university's	instructional program.	6.00292096914164
7037. their duties include evaluation of the information	collected and preparation of recommendations.	4.8723467036979455
7038. more often these	offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data.	7.485379093716394
7039. h the president's opportunity for influencing education reaches	its highest point as he decides which projects he will cut back which	he will advance by increased allowances or new fund-raising efforts.	3.819072705217579
7040. no matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators budget	making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents.	6.25019572785232
7041. when	the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the president's budget	to which his faith and credit are committed; its principal features	should be a product of his most considered judgment.	3.96972999446054
7042. he cannot	of course examine each proposal from scratch.	7.08339902922487
7043. he reviews and shapes	the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote	the aims of the institution.	4.0588605711237875
7044. budgeting must be flexible to	allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological	scholarship.	5.787312948702038
7045. because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly	large sums of money an institution should choose its fields	of prominence.	4.5632366628596035
7046. otherwise it will be headed for bankruptcy at worst	and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and	culturally indispensable branches of learning.	5.988426842628868
7047. in the national interest	even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor	among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the joneses	in all branches.	4.351506613670952
7048. supporting activities- business	management public relations fund-raising- offer presidents one of	their best chances to buy freedom for attention to education h here	the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much	to free a president for his primary role.	4.7685136307641685
7049. in the areas that	do	not relate directly to the educational program expert subordinates will	serve the college or university better than close presidential attention.	4.180861259568142
7050. the president should find strong subordinates and delegate the	widest discretion to them.	6.250273446562253
7051. higher education cannot compete with the	salary scales of the business world but an educational institution can	offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business	community that will offset the differences in income.	4.00769965710486
7052. just as	the entire faculty should know the president's educational philosophy	and objectives so should non-academic officers.	6.121733147704401
7053. they will better	understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program	and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of	mutual goals.	4.761822821267854
7054. a president is frequently besieged to serve in	non-academic civic and governmental capacities to make speeches to lay	groups and to make numerous ceremonial appearances on and off campus.	5.25773126219033
7055. since he can neither accept nor reject them all he must be governed	by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations.	4.401845599911712
7056. declinations and substitutions are better received when he explains	why his obligations to his institution preclude his acceptance.	5.368720319504203
7057. by sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues	the president can develop a cadre of able spokesmen who will help to	create a public perception of the university as an institution something	more than the lengthened shadow of one man.	3.7830746967752993
7058. it has recently become practical to use the	radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information	about these bodies and their atmospheres.	5.589620395929571
7059. the results of present observations	of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with	the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived	from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses	.	3.5055437304685153
7060. when sufficiently accurate and complete measurements	are available it will be possible to set limits on the thermal	and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials	of the moon.	5.690161301695787
7061. observations of the radio emission of a planet	which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater	extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases	give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics	of the solid surface.	3.5410813590579524
7062. radio observations of venus and jupiter have	already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions	of these planets.	6.001515367472971
7063. the observed intensity of the radio emission of	venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity although the	spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and	1o cm is like that of a black body at about 6oo` k.	3.591025301485718
7064. this result	suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet	although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be	a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the	observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence.	5.4130880601294225
7065. for	the case of jupiter the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like	the spectrum of a black-body radiator and it seems very likely that	the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation	from the atmosphere and non-thermal components.	3.62753852331871
7066. of the remaining	planets only mars and saturn have been observed as radio sources	and not very much information is available.	5.861590198257548
7067. mars has been observed	twice at about 3-cm wave length and the intensity of the observed	radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which	might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of mars.	3.739927447186872
7068. the low intensity of the radiation from saturn has limited observations	but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal	origin.	5.284539804943991
7069. no attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining	planets have been reported and because of their distances small	diameters or low temperatures the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths	reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very	low intensity.	4.232403852581044
7070. in spite of this the very large radio reflectors and	improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should	make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets	in a few years.	5.687927971518806
7071. the study of the radio emission of the moon	and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon	at 1.	4.239474118490714
7072. 25-cm wave length by dicke and beringer.	7.1581511048922275
7073. this was	followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.	4.64192548420022
7074. 25-cm	emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by piddington and minnett	.	5.926734816808145
7075. they deduced from their measurements that the radio emission	from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly	sinusoidal fashion; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably	less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission	as measured by pettit and nicholson;	and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3-12 days after	full	moon which is again in contrast to the infrared emission which reaches	its maximum at full moon.	3.3128992406858786
7076. piddington and minnett explained	their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely	to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent	to radio waves although opaque to infrared radiation.	5.386377291273841
7077. the infrared	emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon	while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface	where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced	in amplitude and shifted in phase.	3.503586638171082
7078. since the absorption of radio waves	in rocklike material varies with wave length it should be possible	to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface	and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the	lunar surface material.	5.162884252216841
7079. the radio emission of a planet was	first detected in 1955 when burke and franklin identified the	origin of interference-like radio noise on their records at about 15	meters wave length as emission from jupiter.	3.4607534044690613
7080. this sporadic type of	planetary radiation is discussed by burke and gallet	.	6.235752476069656
7081. steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was	observed from venus at 3.	4.305414028832856
7082. 4 cm and from mars and jupiter	at 3.	7.609303675786696
7083. 15 cm in 1956	and from saturn at 3.	5.137769239677991
7084. 75 cm in 1957	.	9.156731375246077
7085. in the relatively short time since these early observations	venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from	0.	4.0305334880161645
7086. 2 cm and jupiter has been observed over the wave-length	range from 3.	6.549300398357823
7087. the observable characteristics of	planetary radio radiation are the intensity the polarization and the	direction of arrival of the waves.	3.6768831473399355
7088. the maximum angular diameter of	any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc.	4.9392129514598055
7089. this is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very	large reflectors now under construction and consequently the radio emission	of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved.	3.985698532767097
7090. it should	be possible however to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio	sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers.	5.395114698282428
7091. measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity	and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the	planetary radiation at the earth.	4.087277981832139
7092. there have been few measurements specifically	for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation.	7.036643989434098
7093. the measurements made with the nrl 50-foot reflector	which is altitude-azimuth-mounted would have shown a systematic change	with local hour angle in the measured intensities of venus and jupiter	if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized.	3.670463666217996
7094. recent interferometer measurements	have shown the 960-mc emission of jupiter to be partially	polarized	and to originate in a region of larger diameter than the visible	disk.	5.2838553811933755
7095. other than this very significant result most of the information	now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted	to the intensity of the radiation.	4.217208588257537
7096. the concept of apparent	black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from	the moon and the planets.	6.179471886205675
7097. the received radiation is compared with the	radiation from a hypothetical black body which subtends the same solid	angle as the visible disk of the planet.	3.497753656590105
7098. the apparent black-body	disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the	black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that	of the observed radiation.	4.943670359356213
7099. the use of this concept does not specify	the origin of the radiation and only if the planet really radiates	as a black body will the apparent black-body temperature correspond	to the physical temperature of the emitting material.	3.6938400437478918
7100. the radio	radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should	be negligible compared with their thermal emission at centimeter	wave lengths except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar	radio noise.	4.554113521932654
7101. the quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar radiation	would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less	than 1` k.	3.6768831473399355
7102. at meter wave lengths and increase of the order of	10` k in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would	be expected.	5.876344879687143
7103. therefore neglecting the extreme outbursts reflected	solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements	of planetary radiation in the centimeter- and decimeter-wave-length	range.	4.167829394988812
7104. radio observations	of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from 4.	6.673310089069049
7105. 3 mm	to 75 cm and the results are summarized in table 1.	5.076899943965169
7106. observations	have also been made at 1.	8.030066308236874
7107. 5 mm using optical techniques	.	7.782645849544859
7108. not all the observers have used	the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness	distribution when reducing the data and this together with	differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers	must account for much of the disagreement in the measured radio brightness	temperatures.	5.2465089982080535

7111. 7 was small enough	to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface	and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution	at three lunar phases.	4.596929013345525
7112. these observations indicate that the lunar	maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do	the mountainous regions.	5.3420076348222585
7113. mare imbrium seems to be an exception and	remains cooler than the regions which surround it.	5.037463165421454
7114. these contour diagrams	also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with	latitude.	6.072932955837091
7115. very recently observations have been made at 8-mm	wave length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant	beam width of only about 2'	.	4.0167975311090265
7116. the constant-temperature contours are much smoother than those	observed at 4.	5.643027344585572
7117. 3 mm by coates and apparently the emission	at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface	features.	4.188849353619335
7118. such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several	wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can	be properly	interpreted.	5.750077832821131
7119. the observations of mayer mccullough	and sloanaker at 3.	4.465110340486763
7120. 15 cm and of sloanaker at 10.	7.267348536118856
7121. 3 cm have not	previously	been published and will be briefly described.	5.73807167729352
7122. 15 cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval may 3	to june 19 1956 using the 50-foot reflector at the u s naval	research laboratory in washington.	5.468151051315103
7123. the half-intensity diameter	of the antenna beam was about 9' and the angle subtended by the moon	included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes.	4.0524911447415555
7124. the	antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both	measured so that	the	absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle	of the moon was known.	4.9619875538326035
7125. the ratio of the measured antenna temperature	change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature	of the moon over the antenna beam	was found by graphical integration	of the antenna directivity diagram to be 0.	3.3356677493750846
7126. the measured	brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature	at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna	beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion	of the moon's disk is nearly uniform.	5.3845436306762595
7127. the result of the observations	is f where the phase angle |qt is measured	in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute	as well as relative errors.	4.048603187243646

7132. in the discussion	which follows the time average of the radio emission will be	referred to as the constant component and the superimposed periodic	variation will be called the variable component.	5.1475232327036915
7133. 3-cm	observation of sloanaker was made on may 20 1958 using the	84-foot reflector at the maryland point observatory of the u	s naval research laboratory.	3.725131536371901
7134. the age of the moon was about 2	days.	6.946459501974043
7135. the half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was	about 18'.	4.53554809260378
7136. 5 and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming	a gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for	the moon.	5.491712108633186
7137. experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous	graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas.	4.060235568763422
7138. thus the	energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into	the arc.	6.021965529294785
7139. it was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss	of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15% of the	total arc energy a detailed energy balance of the anode was established.	3.801805505008355
7140. the anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount.	6.600686554928239
7141. the dependence	of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating	gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between	100 amp and 200 amp.	3.5229678800761963
7142. qualitative observations were made and	high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the	arc at various mass flow velocities.	5.160513208686437
7143. the high heat	fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate	extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation.	4.025752497958087
7144. the cooling requirements	are particularly severe at the anode.	5.998227019452429
7145. in free burning electric	arcs for instance approximately 90% of the total arc power is transferred	to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of	f as measured by the authors- the exact value depending on the arc	atmosphere.	3.767475899641324
7146. in plasma generators as currently commercially available	for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than	50% of the total energy input is being transferred to the co0ling	medium of the anode.	5.113016420253648
7147. the higher heat transfer rates at the anode	compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical	phenomena occurring in free burning arcs.	3.8170619506713757
7148. in plasma generators the	superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat.	6.370453158772714
7149. the heat	transfer to the anode is due to the following effects: 1.	4.727757290668442
7150. heat	of condensation plus kinetic energy of the electrons impinging	on the anode.	6.093123995732186
7151. this energy transfer depends on the current the	temperature in the arc column the anode material and the conditions	in the anode sheath.	4.128177984271262
7152. heat transfer by molecular conduction as well	as by radiation from the arc column.	5.836381488750392
7153. the heat transfer to	the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from	the cathode towards the anode with velocities up f.	3.5050988515911787
7154. this phenomenon	has been experimentally investigated in detail by maecker	.	6.6993653757925555
7155. the pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the	magnetic field in the arc	.	5.138326247447363
7156. hence the flow conditions at the anode of free	burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point.	5.918608559133053
7157. it is apparent	from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements	for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with	those for the cathode.	3.852010767427344
7158. the gas flow through a plasma generator will modify	these conditions; however the anode is still the part receiving	the largest heat flux.	5.086350174945562
7159. an attempt to improve the life of the anodes	or the efficiency of the plasma generators must therefore aim at	a reduction of the anode loss.	4.423988831234164
7160. the following possibilities exist for	achieving this: 1.	7.167210679324329
7161. the use of high voltages and low currents by proper	design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given	power output.	3.9384151138169137
7162. continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode	by flow or magnetic forces.	5.699223288067105
7163. feed back of the energy transferred	to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode.	4.830277357944147
7164. the third method was to our knowledge successfully applied for the	first time by c sheer and co-workers.	5.795252424573479
7165. the purpose of	the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish	an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect	of blowing on the arc voltage.	3.9380188832823966
7166. gas injection through a porous anode	not only feeds back the energy transferred	to the anode by the above mentioned processes but also modifies the conditions	in the arc itself.	4.977983226024847
7167. a detailed study of this latter phenomenon	was not attempted in this paper.	4.373959716063931
7168. argon was used as a blowing gas to	exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction.	6.413998048582385
7169. the anode	material was porous graphite.	5.148617142042534
7170. sintered porous metals should be usable	in principle.	7.1581511048922275
7171. however technical difficulties arise by melting at local	hot spots.	5.456184390036283
7172. the experimental arrangement as described below is based	on the geometry of free burning arcs.	5.306470039684517
7173. thus direct comparisons can	be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during	the past years and decades by numerous investigators.	4.104965996407235
7174. figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic	views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode	holder.	5.160513208686437
7175. the cathode consisted of a 14'' diameter thoriated tungsten	rod attached to a water cooled copper tube.	3.8682390177842865
7176. this tube could be	adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the	required electrode spacing.	5.566975471211053
7177. the anode in figure 2 was mounted by means	of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk.	3.5754695776410808
7178. the	transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially	towards the cathode below.	5.659455227543579
7179. inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere	was prevented by the two disks shown in figure 2.	4.087080977832333
7180. argon was also	blown at low velocities through a tube coaxial	with	the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the	arc by air.	5.103675880876918
7181. the anode consisted of a 12 inch diameter porous graphite	plug 14 inch long.	4.066873400905752
7182. the graphite was national carbon nc	60 which has a porosity of 50% and an average pore size of 30 this	small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving	the anode.	4.574422045075437
7183. the anode plug was inserted into a carbon	anode holder.	4.320730508808147
7184. a shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream	temperature of the transpiring gas.	6.559381205814565
7185. it was exposed to a high velocity	gas jet.	5.997416751010725
7186. a plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided	the chamber above the porous plug into two parts.	5.130892137311206
7187. this arrangement	had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by	natural convection.	4.655123020546994
7188. two pyrometers shown in figure 1 and 2	served for simultaneous measurement of	the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along	the anode holder.	5.350467553261773
7189. three thermocouples were placed at different locations	in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its	temperature.	4.396158124401149
7190. another anode holder used in the experiments is shown	in figure 3.	7.550822790729566
7191. in this design the anode holder is water cooled and	the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring	the temperature rise of the coolant.	4.028758817694305
7192. to reduce heat transfer from	the hot has to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc a carbon	shield was attached tothe surface providing an air gap of 116	inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder.	5.0964682323477835
7193. in addition	the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil	to reduce radiation.	4.755539661056271
7194. temperatures of the shield and of the surface	of the water-cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account	for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode	plug.	5.349374369952281
7195. the argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated	by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator.	3.769080263200913
7196. the power	source was a commercial d c rectifier.	5.998227019452429
7197. at 100 amp the	360 cycle ripple was less than 0.	5.307606677637061
7198. 5 v with a resistive	load.	10.454853980714894
7199. the current was regulated by means of a variable resistor and	measured with a 50 mv shunt and millivoltmeter.	4.301124562539225
7200. the arc voltage	was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode	and cathode holders.	5.195459085703678
7201. because of the falling characteristic of the	rectifier no ballast resistor was required for stability of operation.	4.886639407509721
7202. a high frequency starter was used to start the arc.	6.680559648129682
7203. procedure and error analysis	_1.	6.683325264329536
7204. transpiration cooled anode with	the anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed	with two goals in mind.	5.454336586728915
7205. the heat losses of the holder were to be reduced	as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat	balance can be made.	4.170829367269911
7206. in order to reduce the number of variable parameters	all experiments were made with a constant arc length of 0.	7.271565454908382
7207. 5''	and a current of 100 amp.	5.66037853959279
7208. the argon flow through the porous anode	was varied systematically between f.	5.506908456901043
7209. the lower limit	was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started	to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug	and that it became highly unstable.	3.7965865005073827
7210. the upper limit was determined by	the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature	since only a small region of the anode was struck by the	arc.	4.80938502986005
7211. this region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the	anode surface changed size and location continuously.	4.6464512631943595
7212. for each	mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured.	7.064725709308691
7213. to measure the surface	temperature of the anode plug the surface was scanned with a pyrometer.	4.786366660537001
7214. as it turned out a very hot region occurred on the plug.	7.795151777576792
7215. its temperature	was denoted by f.	7.036439633035965
7216. the size of this hot region was estimated	by eye.	7.210055989699566
7217. the rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards	the outer diameter of the plug.	4.489260872485649
7218. the mean temperature of this region	was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the	edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug.	4.698723859097317
7219. it was denoted by f.	7.180511823093353
7220. the mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to	the following relation: f where x is the fraction of the plug area	covered by the hot spot.	4.703630557645975
7221. assuming thermal equilibrium between the	anode surface and the transpiring argon the gas enthalpy rise through	the anode was calculated according to the relation f whereby the specific	heat of argon was taken as f.	3.7943181490228337
7222. this calculation results in	an	enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally	distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass	velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures.	5.0645179445198725
7223. the upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple	shown in figure 2 was f.	3.93777821379478
7224. the f values are listed in table 1	together	with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages.	5.169168242508911
7225. simultaneously	with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer	readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode	holder as indicated on figure 2.	3.8942163916349872
7226. some of these temperatures are plotted	in figure 4.	9.68876343126282
7227. they showed no marked dependence on the flow rate	within the accuracy of these measurements.	4.822225074877705
7228. thus the dotted line shown	in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for	all blowing rates.	5.90608818218209
7229. the thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown	in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of	f.	3.7179193381860367
7230. this temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which	the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned.	5.8407480430357746
7231. it	is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode	holder to make the energy flux radiated from the environment toward	the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements.	4.459762632202906
7232. the reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder	and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also	be small because of the specular characteristic of the metal surfaces	and of the specific geometry.	5.190331340908386
7233. the total heat loss through the anode	holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical	piece into the adjacent metal parts.	3.8895267125975894
7234. it was calculated from the	temperature gradient f at f inch as f.	6.499658644972403
7235. the total heat flux from	the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby f the temperature	distribution of figure 4 gives f for all blowing rates assuming f.	3.5491138564353872
7236. the temperature dependent value of |e was taken from ref	7.	5.803216729732998
7237. the radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according to	f where f is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures f	and f calculated analogously to equation.	3.642887300458369
7238. a band viscometer is shown in figure 2.	7.690720360077045
7239. it consists of two blocks	with flat surfaces held apart by shims.	5.647205496461132
7240. there is a small well in	the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed.	7.048747545384288
7241. a tape	of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the	fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks.	3.718889716919071
7242. in	normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull	the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks.	5.663964573791989
7243. after it	has reached terminal velocity the time for the tape to travel a known	distance is recorded.	4.871153927781109
7244. by the use of various weights data for a force-rate	of shear graph can be obtained.	7.240697809770382
7245. the instrument used for this	work was a slight modification of that previously described.	3.93777821379478
7246. in	this test a f tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and	pulley at a rate of f with a clearance of 0.	5.2612919117912815
7247. 002'' on each side of	the tape.	6.713020153178141
7248. this gives a rate of shear of f.	8.956762241372171
7249. this however can only	be considered	approximate as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the	build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley	during the runs.	3.899329363544719
7250. the face of one block contained a hole 116''	in diameter which led to a	manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure.	5.306939804482744
7251. although	there were only four fluids tested it was apparent that there were	two distinct types.	4.400207595018561
7252. two of the fluids showed a high-positive normal pressure	when undergoing shear and two showed small negative pressures	which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures	generated by the other two.	5.898924885336373
7253. figure 3 shows the data on	a silicone fluid labeled 12500 cps which gave a high positive normal	pressure.	3.996502389132312
7254. although the tape was run for over 1 hr a steady	state was not reached and it was concluded that the reason for this was	that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material	fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow	rate.	5.572507619725648
7255. a system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of	the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure	were to be made in a reasonable time.	4.658108537440371
7256. a back pressure was then introduced	and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated	which was greater the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure.	5.135384435999046
7257. by this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted	by a sample of polybutene was	over half an atmosphere.	4.5046752085889015
7258. the actual pressure was not determined because	the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand.	5.032521805892869
7259. the two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes	with molecular weights which were stated to be 520 and 300.	3.8223378251521427
7260. these are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more	newtonian because of their lower molecular weight.	6.5722521448922935
7261. the maximum suction	was 3.	5.528211544885176
7262. 25'' of test fluid measured from the top of the block	and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids.	5.916015665140667
7263. it is presumed	that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor	of the assembly since different readings were obtained with the same	fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly	of the apparatus.	3.8277052169416326
7264. this negative pressure is not explained by the	velocity head f since this is not sufficient to explain the readings	by several magnitudes.	5.885670374994949
7265. these experiments can be considered	exploratory only.	6.149974862923358
7266. however they do demonstrate the presence of large	normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast	by the theory in the first part of the paper.	6.705448968079644
7267. they also give information	which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument	for the measurement of the normal pressures.	5.137176909836857
7268. such an instrument would	be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well	as theoretical studies.	6.180295591412758
7269. the elasticity as a parameter of fluids	which	is not subject to simple measurement at present and it is a parameter	which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial	materials.	3.9823956847167317
7270. such an instrument is expected to be especially useful	if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as	printing inks paints adhesives molten plastics and bread dough for	the elasticity is related to those various properties termed length	shortness spinnability etc which are usually judged	by subjective methods at present.	5.68307883175041
7271. the actual change f	caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential	times the volume just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic	pressure head.	4.2156230406647515
7272. if the volume is the molal volume then f is obtained	on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists.	5.923683594890571
7273. although the f calculation is obvious by analogy with that	for gravitational field and osmotic pressure it is interesting to confirm	it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects.	4.051738516615777
7274. consider a shear field with a height of h and a cross-sectional	area of a opposed by a manometer with a height of h	and a cross-sectional area	of a.	5.1705205878247
7275. if f is the change per unit volume in gibbs function	caused by the shear field at constant p and t and |r	is the density of the fluid then the total potential energy of	the system above the reference height is f.	3.5043035616424243
7276. f is the work necessary	to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h.	5.754760735080015
7277. the total volume of the system above the reference height is f and	h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential	energy of the system in terms of h.	4.365749389952735
7278. the minimum total potential	energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to h	and equating to zero.	5.464722230088547
7279. this gives f which is the pressure.	7.43899428370876
7280. this	is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum	gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential	energy for equilibrium.	5.589391893957747
7281. this method can be extended to include the	concentration differences caused by shear fields.	4.781807803396696
7282. the relation between	osmotic pressure and the gibbs function may also be developed in an	analogous way.	5.7050444081059135
7283. in the above development we have applied the thermodynamics	of equilibrium to	the steady state.	4.736860853159998
7284. this can be justified thermodynamically in this case	and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared.	6.788709073988991
7285. this has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by philippoff	that the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be	applied to flowing solutions.	4.036035091026692
7286. there is one exception to the above	statement as has been pointed out and that is that fluids can relax	by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear so the statement should	be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar.	5.588711463662323
7287. if the mechanics	are similar we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also	be similar.	4.622747623524068
7288. the concept of the strain energy as a gibbs function	difference f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is	compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies	of fluids undergoing shear.	4.874649122658508
7289. essentially these birefringence studies	show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45` to	the direction of shear and as the rate of shear increases the direction	of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction	of shear.	3.712518533146751
7290. according to philippoff the recoverable shear s is	given by f where |c is the angle of extinction.	6.026584163127961
7291. from this and	the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic	energy of deformation which should be equal to the f calculated from	the pressure normal to the shearing face.	4.40237754871301
7292. there is another	means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses	in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature	and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids	in shear fields.	5.810868712363909
7293. these droplets are distorted by the normal forces	just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's	hands.	3.927385465312423
7294. these droplets appear to be ellipsoids and it is mathematically	convenient to assume that they are.	7.362296622955403
7295. if they are not ellipsoids	the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation.	7.971122516179575
7296. the direction of	the tension of minimum pressure is of course given by the direction	of the major axis of the ellipsoids.	5.6985249863041645
7297. mason and taylor both show that	the major axis of the ellipsoids is at 45` at low rates of shear and	that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear.	3.7496881856055486
7298. this is	of course a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence	studies.	5.902992870979968
7299. the relative forces can be calculated from the various	radii of curvature if we assume: the surface tension is uniform	on the surface of the drop.	3.919353710501759
7300. that because of the low viscosity	of the fluid the internal pressure is the same in all directions.	6.967200738240369
7301. the kinetic effects are negligible.	5.148617142042534
7302. since the	shape of the drop conforms to the force field it does not appreciably	affect the distribution of forces in the fluid.	6.1733775624563085
7303. these are reasonable	assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity	fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear.	4.2502180919865555
7304. just as the pressure	exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is f and the pressure	exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is f the	pressure exerted by any curved surface is f where |g is the interfacial	tension and f and f are the two radii of curvature.	4.8473124495135425
7305. this	formula is given by rumscheidt and mason.	5.3285636594893
7306. if a is the major	axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes	the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis	is f and the difference in pressure along the a and b	axes is f.	5.174792562982592
7307. there are no data published in the literature on	the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas.	4.596621826299353
7308. however	there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol phthalate	suspended in corn syrup of 71 poises in a paper	by mason and bartok.	5.103675880876918
7309. this viscosity of the material in the drops	is of course not negligible.	4.642152922456333
7310. measurements on the photograph in this	paper give f at the maximum rate of shear of f.	5.454336586728915
7311. if it is assumed	that the formula given by lodge of f cosec 2|c applies the	pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle	of inclination of the major axis and from this the interfacial tension	can be calculated.	3.9420836138346913
7312. its value was f from the above data.	7.580999459648759
7313. this	appears to be high as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity	of the material in the drops.	3.996502389132312
7314. it is appropriate to call attention	to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous	to rubber-like deformation.	5.583569522749306
7315. the internal energy of an ideal	gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume.	3.7940636836225425
7316. in other words if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant	temperature the work done in compressing it is completely converted	into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink.	5.304475833391362
7317. this means that	work equals q which in turn equals f.	5.771040315606705
7318. there is a	well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that	f where \q is the probability that state	could be reached by chance alone.	5.47108090478548
7319. this is known as	conformational entropy.	7.801482202142699
7320. this conformational entropy is in this case	equal to the usual entropy for there are no other changes or other	energies involved.	5.748003196175454
7321. note that though the ideal gas itself contains no	additional energy the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure.	4.279715344398652
7322. the energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect gas must come	as thermal energy from its surroundings.	5.1665572303118426
7323. a proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline f as a	function of magnetic field and temperature is presented.	3.970296342830025
7324. f is paramagnetic	and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects	lead to line broadening.	6.681323739698835
7325. the lines are asymmetric and over the	range of field f gauss and temperature f the asymmetry increases with	increasing f and decreasing t.	3.662966444976969
7326. an isotropic resonance shift	of f to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine	contact interaction.	5.8669945065529845
7327. the general theory of resonance shifts is used to	derive a general expression for the second moment f of a polycrystalline	paramagnetic sample and is specialized to f.	3.9133877238218515
7328. the theory predicts	a linear dependence of f on f where |j is the experimentally	determined curie-weiss constant.	5.055693822342846
7329. the experimental second moment	f conforms to the relation f in agreement with theory.	4.02198956388302
7330. hence the	electron paramagnetic effects can be separated from the nuclear	effects.	6.943808142181845
7331. the paramagnetic dipole effects provide some	information on the particle shapes.	4.200697917275358
7332. the nuclear dipole effects provide	some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei but the symmetry	of the f bond in f remains in doubt.	4.776134831679969
7333. the	magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a	tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei.	4.090004191046892
7334. it	is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since	quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations	of structure.	5.582318581041656
7335. f appeared to be well suited for the study	of these matters since it is a normal paramagnet with three unpaired	electrons on the chromium its crystal structure is very simple	and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong f bond provides	structural interest.	4.085598504452345
7336. we first discuss the f bond in f.	7.544019968143898
7337. we	then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles	with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment.	4.1215129366030725
7338. indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from	nuclear effects.	8.84663268511749
7339. the information provided by the electron paramagnetic	effects is then discussed and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted	in terms of various motional-modified models of the f bond	in f.	3.6472532424050677
7340. theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond	generally agree that the f bond will be linear in the absence of	peculiarities of packing in the solid.	5.109904303099451
7341. moreover it will be asymmetric	until a certain critical f distance is reached below which it will	become symmetric.	4.852404099452967
7342. there is ample evidence from many sources that the	f bond in f is symmetric.	6.566277930938018
7343. the f distance in f is 2.	4.641973630080768
7344. there is evidence though less convincing than for f that the f	bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric.	6.238378693555158
7345. here the f distance	is 2.	8.151948121361782
7346. a number of semiempirical estimates by various workers	lead to the conclusion that the f bond becomes symmetric when the	f bond length is about 2.	5.769012735347086
7347. 5 a but aside from the possible	example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports	of symmetric f bonds.	5.093388376656727
7348. douglass has studied the crystal structure	of f by x-ray diffraction.	6.504494176678253
7349. he finds the structure contains an f	bond with the f distance of f.	4.521642382504672
7350. there is then the possibility that	this f bond is symmetric although douglass was unable to determine	its symmetry from his x-ray data.	6.178739678438925
7351. douglass found f to be	trigonal laue symmetry f with f f.	4.535752126583474
7352. x-ray and experimental	density showed one formula unit in the unit cell corresponding to a paramagnetic	ion density of f.	5.5830948676068095
7353. the x-ray data did not permit douglass	to determine uniquely the space group but a negative test for piezoelectricity	led him to assume a center of symmetry.	3.4757355708806807
7354. under this assumption	the space group must be f and the following are the positions	of the atoms in the unit cell.	6.2711405293380915
7355. this space group requires the hydrogen	bond to be symmetric.	4.987041256881453
7356. douglass found powder intensity calculations	and measurements to agree best for f.	6.093123995732186
7357. these data lead to a structure	in which sheets of cr atoms lie between two sheets of o	atoms.	4.341887828051023
7358. the o atoms in each sheet are close packed and each cr	atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of o atoms.	4.803106133761721
7359. the f	layers are stacked normal to the 111 axis with the lower oxygens	of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower	layer in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers.	3.60864882119868
7360. the	separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds.	6.806723317680827
7361. a drawing of the	structure is to be found in reference 6.	6.085630214279519
7362. the gross details	of the structure appear reasonable.	6.235764708001158
7363. the structure appears to be unique	among rooh compounds but is the same as that assumed by	f.	4.855568936232
7364. the bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits	and the volume per oxygen is about normal.	5.009465240878374
7365. however the possible absence	of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off f	but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent with f at	f and f at f where f represents the oxygens	on one side of the f layers and f those on the other side.	3.926075215187399
7366. however	any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely	short f interlayer distance of 2.	5.659455227543579
7367. 55 a or the non-hydrogen-bonded	f interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.	4.21292691591616
7368. hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in	this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence.	6.071361647968051
7369. the only effect of lack of a center would then be to release	the hydrogen atoms to occupy general rather than special positions	along the 111 axis.	3.901205393855603
7370. if the f bond is linear then there	are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms: the hydrogen	atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the	oxygen sheets; all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet but the sheet	is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other; hydrogen atoms	are asymmetrically placed either randomly or in an ordered way so	that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others	are closer to the lower oxygen atoms.	4.534943117275683
7371. position appears to us	to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on	general chemical structural grounds.	5.009948512062018
7372. a randomization of ups and	downs is more likely than ordered ups and downs in	position since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the	position of one could hardly affect the position of another and also	since ordered up and down implies a larger unit cell for	which no evidence exists.	4.758337781097301
7373. therefore the only unknown structural feature	would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically	or asymmetrically.	4.50713121680935
7374. douglass prepared his sample of f by thermal decomposition of	aqueous chromic acid at 300-325`c.	5.659455227543579
7375. dr douglass was kind enough	to lend us about 5 grams of his material.	4.721645305621356
7376. this material proved	to be unsatisfactory since we could not obtain reproducible results on	various portions of the sample.	5.61150568637835
7377. subsequently we learned from douglass	that his sample contained a few percent f impurity.	4.305414028832856
7378. since f	is ferromagnetic we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically	contaminated f would be suspect.	5.901105153168451
7379. plane suggested another	preparation of f which we used here.	4.912032708252027
7380. 500 ml of 1m aqueous	f	with 1 g f added are heated in a bomb at 170`c for 48 hours.	5.261978078996141
7381. a very fine gray solid is formed water-washed	by centrifugation and dried at 110`c.	4.531468245811328
7382. differential thermal	analysis showed a very small endothermic reaction at 340`c and	a large endothermic reaction at 470`c.	5.553307936836206
7383. this latter reaction is	in accord with the reported decomposition of f.	4.741291481165042
7384. thermogravimetric analysis	showed a weight loss of 1.	7.1581511048922275
7385. 8% centered at 337`c and another	weight loss of 10.	4.855658467968249
7386. the expected weight loss for	f going to f and f is 10.	5.7454225127141605
7387. mass spectrometric analysis of	gases evolved upon heating to 410`c indicated nitrogen oxides	and water vapor.	4.248195654142848
7388. the small reaction occurring at 337`c is probably	caused by decomposition of occluded nitrates and perhaps by a small	amount of some hydrous material other than f.	4.742962761462621
7389. all subsequent measurements	were made on material which had been heated to 375`c for	one hour.	4.984815367019751
7390. emission spectra indicated f calcium and all other impurities	much lower.	6.289010577019261
7391. 8% cr as compared	with 61.	6.094118058689911
7392. however f adsorbs water from the atmosphere and	this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight	loss.	5.866268300880114
7393. the x-ray diffraction pattern of the material taken with	cuk|a radiation indicated the presence of no extra lines and	was in good agreement with the pattern of douglass.	3.9238791192503326
7394. magnetic analyses	by r g meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic	impurities.	6.093123995732186
7395. f was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired	electron per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of f	where f.	4.079365581467883
7396. for exactly three unpaired electrons the coefficient would	be 3.	7.064725709308691
7397. an infrared spectrum obtained by h a benesi and	r g snyder of this laboratory showed bands in the positions	found by jones.	3.962713371895244
7398. electron microscopic examination of the f	sample showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles about 0.	5.9400098698642685
7399. the particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the single-crystal	domains are smaller than this.	4.012715720819275
7400. the x-ray data are consistent	with particle sizes of 1000 a or greater.	5.390500575037483
7401. we found no obvious	effects due to preferred orientation of the crystallites in this sample	nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron	microscopic examination.	4.2101667750229765
7402. measurements	the magnetic resonance absorption was detected by employing	a varian model f broad line spectrometer and the associated 12-inch	electromagnet system.	5.22301107017409
7403. one measurement at 40 mcsec was obtained	with the varian model f unit.	4.805631483950843
7404. a bridged-t type of bridge was	used in the 10-16 mcsec range.	6.037261697359159
7405. the rf power level was maintained	small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape distortions	by saturation effects.	3.9035546796378844
7406. a modulation frequency of 40 cps with an	amplitude as small as possible commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise	quality was used.	5.191731705318003
7407. background spectra were obtained in	all cases.	5.66037853959279
7408. the spectrometer was adjusted to minimize the amount of dispersion	mode mixed in with the absorption signal.	6.049793601179522
7409. a single value	of the thermal relaxation time f at room temperature was measured	by the progressive saturation method.	3.9688836699504595
7410. the value of f estimated at	470 gauss was f microseconds.	6.7430281581797935
7411. a single measurement of the spin-spin	relaxation time f was obtained at 10 mcsec by pulse methods.	4.030778550474947
7412. this measurement was obtained by w blumberg of the university of	california berkeley by observing the breadth of the free induction	decay signal.	5.875508121003273
7413. the value derived was 16 microseconds.	5.3880957508877225
7414. field	shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line defined	as the field about which the first moment is zero.	5.7032597622622045
7415. second moments	of the spectra were computed by numerical integration.	5.389140101483614
7416. corrections	were applied for modulation broadening apparatus background and	field shift.	6.522871687113793
7417. spectra were obtained over the temperature range	of 77-294`k.	5.066959048406199
7418. for the low-temperature measurements the sample was	cooled	by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of andrew and	eades.	6.350400672776399
7419. the temperature was maintained to within about f for the	period of time required to make the measurement.	4.207219949298241
7420. one sample which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation	at 375`c showed the presence of adsorbed water	as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow	at room temperature and which disappeared due to broadening at low	temperature.	5.191986548621147
7421. the data reported here are either from spectra from which	the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra	of samples evacuated and sealed off at 375`c which contain no	adsorbed water.	3.371944960000622
7422. the measured powder density of the f used	here was about f approximately one-third that of the crystal density	.	5.524309983600873
7423. such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of	about f.	5.311519214249496
7424. spectra were obtained from a powdered sample having	the shape of a right circular cylinder with a height-to-diameter ratio	of 4:1.	5.552820769581464
7425. the top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical.	5.152669681652105
7426. spectra were also obtained from a sample in a spherical container	which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass	tube.	5.919663589406249
7427. the bubble was filled to the top and special precautions were	taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary.	4.012186463108036
7428. spectra	were also obtained from a third sample of f which had been diluted	to three times its original volume with powdered anhydrous alundum	.	5.3800709439722
7429. this sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to	that described above.	4.508640324326541
7430. polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants	were a threat though expensive and these same polyphosphates	spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates	and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited.	5.119120063674227
7431. the market today for detergent builders is quite diverse.	4.320392448273633
7432. the best	known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty spray-dried	detergent formulations for household use.	5.124518734431128
7433. these widely advertised	products which are used primarily for washing clothes are based on	high-sudsing	synthetic organic actives	and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture	of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate.	3.58449679515668
7434. in the	household market there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations	based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder;	light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder; and the	dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules none	of which are now nationally advertised.	5.207931921858214
7435. a well-publicized entrant	which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent	with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and	active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builderactive	ratio.	3.4894243186958867
7436. hard-surface cleaning in household application is	represented by two classes of alkaline products: the formulations	made expressly for machine dishwashers and the general-purpose	cleaners used for walls and woodwork.	4.882518002615294
7437. the better quality products in	both of these lines contain phosphate builders.	4.226803215498985
7438. in addition many of	the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis	in trisodium orthophosphate which is still the major ingredient of	a number of such products.	5.4882357987252055
7439. many scouring powders now also contain phosphates.	6.162995337120509
7440. these hard-surface cleaners are discussed in chapter 28.	7.2939254200701615
7441. cleaning process	cleaning or detergent action is entirely	a matter of surfaces.	4.681571082223364
7442. wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium a solid	substrate soil to be removed and the detergent or surface-active	material.	5.6015540994579025
7443. an oversimplified differentiation between soft- and hard-surface	cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved.	4.406531935377089
7444. one	gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of f.	7.388470691972045
7445. in contrast a metal coupon f in size would have a magnitude from	100000 to a million less.	4.526911883233557
7446. even here there is room for some variation	for metal surfaces vary in smoothness absorptive capacity and chemical	reactivity.	5.885457544216127
7447. spring used a brush surface-analyzer in a metal-cleaning	study and showed considerable differences in soil removal depending	upon surface roughness.	3.9712793448166734
7448. there are considerable differences between	the requirements for textile and hard-surface cleaning.	6.91450949012057
7449. exclusive	of esthetic values such as high- or low-foam level perfume content	etc the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles	are high.	3.8439997618966375
7450. no matter how they are formulated a large number of organic	actives are simply not suitable for this application since they	do not give adequate soil removal.	6.195674410814954
7451. this is best demonstrated by practical	washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with	the same detergent formulation.	4.358801928111699
7452. a good formulation will keep the clothes	clean and white after many washings; whereas with a poor formulation	the clothes exhibit a build-up of tattle-tale grey and dirty	spots- sometimes with bad results even after the first wash.	5.074726139888361
7453. since	practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive a number	of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation	of detergents.	4.074465217873082
7454. harris has indicated that two devices the launder-ometer	and terg-o-tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent	testing and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled	fabrics.	5.209655400596317
7455. also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general	use.	5.37342174860599
7456. the soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations	are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by	even the best detergent formulation in a single wash.	5.796119736464846
7457. in this way	numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations	can be obtained by measuring the reflectance of the	cloth swatches before and after washing.	4.219669906591711
7458. soil redeposition is evaluated	by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones.	6.153820661871595
7459. as is the case with	the surface-active agent the requirements for builders to be used in	detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high.	4.483099819609477
7460. large numbers	of potential builders have been investigated but none have been	found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide	range of conditions met in practice.	4.956540402939004
7461. the problems of hard-surface	cleaning are not nearly as complex.	5.192878750720373
7462. in hard-surface cleaning the	inorganic salts are more important than the organic active.	6.787668978990182
7463. indeed	when the proper inorganic constituents are employed practically any	wetting or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present	in sufficient amount in a hard-surface cleaning formulation.	3.738201918147265
7464. hydroxides	orthophosphates borates carbonates and silicates are important	inorganic ingredients of hard-surface cleaners.	6.093123995732186
7465. in addition the	polyphosphates are also used probably acting more as peptizing agents	than anything else.	4.800953176424609
7466. the importance of the inorganic constituents in	hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers.	6.247470092473489
7467. chemistry of washing	although there is no question	but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena	which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that	these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the	present this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture	of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces.	3.7248102700808188
7468. the purpose of washing is obviously to remove soils which are arbitrarily	classed in the four major categories given below:	dirt which is here defined as particulate material which is usually	inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit	colloidal properties.	4.737205037140556
7469. greasy soils which are typified by	hydrocarbons and fats.	5.066959048406199
7470. stains which include the wide variety of nonparticulate	materials which give color even when present in very low concentration	on the soiled object.	5.491548481406992
7471. miscellaneous soils which primarily	include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave	a residue.	4.21292691591616
7472. the dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically	held by surface irregularities to some extent.	5.201822978274158
7473. however a major factor	in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under	the name of van der waal's forces.	4.091972267801938
7474. this is a theoretically complicated	dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle	to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles or to stick	to an uncharged surface.	5.385619016940795
7475. obviously if colloidal particles bear charges	of opposite sign or if one kind is charged and the other kind is	not the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate	will be greatly reinforced.	3.9242718575207656
7476. likewise a charged particle will tend	to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa and a charged particle	will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite	charge.	4.815391403268571
7477. in addition dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface	by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids including	liquid greases.	4.116579930554575
7478. greases stains and miscellaneous soils	are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface.	6.093123995732186
7479. in most cases these soils	are taken up as liquids through capillary action.	5.243035068466114
7480. in an essentially	static system an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless	the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active	agent.	5.6632975893037445
7481. the washing process whereby soils are removed consists	basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles	and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off	the debris and acts to some extent as a dissolving and solvating	agent.	3.472694289947275
7482. greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water;	and	natural waters in addition often contain impurities such as calcium	salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove.	4.873699127315271
7483. the detergent active is that substance	which primarily acts to remove greasy soils.	4.012715720819275
7484. the other constituents	in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains	and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils.	6.0083822953435515
7485. as is well known	detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of moderately	high molecular weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the	property of forming micelles in solution.	4.018445304893243
7486. physicochemical investigations	of anionic surfactants including the soaps have shown that there	is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below	a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration.	4.839007203939244
7487. below the critical micelle concentration monomers and some	dimers are present.	5.260981873755177
7488. in the critical micelle region there is	a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles which have	a degree of polymerization averaging around 60-80.	5.462573646497722
7489. for anionics	these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which	the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups	face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase.	4.2718552534613945
7490. obviously	hydrophobic	substances such as greases oils or particles having	a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle	than in the aqueous phase.	5.969498882438924
7491. micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable	amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be	increased as much as approximately two-fold.	4.506334870184685
7492. although the matter has	not been unequivocally demonstrated the available data show that micelles	in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process.	5.550854909281888
7493. related to micelle formation is the technologically important	ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil-water interfaces	in such a manner that the polar end of the molecule is directed	towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the	oily phase.	3.736567535821713
7494. in the cleaning process sorbed greasy soils become coated	in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant.	5.671719354955688
7495. then during washing	the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets	can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass with the aid of	mechanical action and enter the aqueous phase.	3.9252658001412355
7496. obviously a substance	which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of	the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off	the greasy soil.	5.142993547683909
7497. substances other than detergent actives also	tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other	contiguous condensed phases.	3.8880356915934375
7498. this is particularly true of highly charged	ions especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes.	6.730722384390768
7499. whereas the usual organic surface-active agent is strongly	sorbed at oil-water interfaces the highly charged ions are most strongly	sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting	an ionic structure.	3.7291233604238996
7500. thus for aqueous	media we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic	or hydrophobic surface-active agent and of an idealized builder as	a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent.	5.495044329270998
7501. from the equilibrium	sorption data which are available it seems logical to expect	that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of	the dirt so as to give it a greatly increased	negative charge.	4.397301677400404
7502. the charged particles then repel each other and are	also repelled from the charged surface which almost invariably bears	a negative charge under washing conditions.	4.982708624345451
7503. the negatively charged dirt	particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase.	3.911162329557564
7504. this	hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic	actives in detergency.	5.980332303617451
7505. it does not consider the kinetic effects	of the phosphate builders on sorption-desorption phenomena which will	be discussed later.	4.862577264219526
7506. the crude picture of	the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as: f	the influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may	be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale.	4.755467026449081
7507. freed soil	must be dispersed and protected against flocculation.	5.066959048406199
7508. cleaned cloth	must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil.	6.289010577019261
7509. it is	evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one	detergent constituent acting alone are severe.	4.309941617365307
7510. upon consideration	of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing	process it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent	constituents having synergistic properties has gained widespread	acceptance.	6.044102946432084
7511. in the over-all process it is difficult to assign a	pure role to each constituent of a built-detergent formulation;	and indeed there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles	of the active builder antiredeposition agent etc than there	is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making	up a given commercial organic active.	3.791610257001554
7512. the thermal exchange of chlorine between f and liquid f is	readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180` and above.	5.097076243535302
7513. the	photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of	unity in the liquid phase at 65` using light absorbed only by the f.	4.096677091064432
7514. in the gas phase with f of f and f of f quantum yields	of the	order of f have been observed at 85`.	5.4920563317026
7515. despite extensive attempts	to obtain highly pure reagents serious difficulty was experienced in	obtaining reproducible rates of reaction.	4.414295446924475
7516. it appears possible to set	a lower limit of about f for the activation energy of the abstraction	of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine	atom to form f radical.	4.963807891160672
7517. the rate of the gas phase exchange reaction	appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light	intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at	the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular	radical combination reactions.	3.8083172306992346
7518. because of the simplicity	of the molecules isotopic exchange reactions between elemental	halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer	particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic	kinetic data.	5.5539123869968705
7519. it would appear that it should be possible to determine	unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both	the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies	of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals	as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen	bond.	3.8899641271096304
7520. the reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed	particularly suited for such studies.	5.70123384720487
7521. it should be possible to prepare	very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum	system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid.	4.360329005625983
7522. it should be	possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by	the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to	addition of radioactive chlorine.	5.544083196933352
7523. furthermore the exchange would not	be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it	would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for	abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be	too high; also it would be expected that f would compete very effectively	with any impurities as a scavenger for f radicals.	3.831158883457096
7524. contrary	to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree	of reproducibility one would wish even with extensive efforts to prepare	especially pure reagents.	5.010346701729108
7525. we are reporting these investigations	here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently	simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results	furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of	chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride.	3.9904687137534345
7526. matheson highest purity tank chlorine was passed through a	tube of resublimed f into an evacuated pyrex system where it was condensed	with liquid air.	5.1121156763205375
7527. it was then distilled at least three times	from a trap at -78` to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction	being retained in each distillation.	3.863768911544056
7528. the purified product was	stored at -78` in a tube equipped with a break seal.	5.532448189865502
7529. of several	methods employed for tagging chlorine with radiochlorine the exchange	of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum chloride at room temperature	was found to be the most satisfactory.	4.441781966793966
7530. to prepare the latter	silver chloride was precipitated from a solution containing f obtained	from the oak ridge national laboratory.	5.74805739449229
7531. the silver chloride was	fused under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chips with the resultant	product of f which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line.	3.6775972095263922
7532. previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange	was allowed to take place.	6.008774309309853
7533. the radiochlorine was stored at -78`	in a tube equipped with a break seal.	4.203178258756057
7534. liter quantities of mallinckrodt	low sulfur reagent grade carbon tetrachloride were saturated	with f and f and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 watt	tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inches.	5.106844898048084
7535. the mixture was then extracted	with alkali and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride	was distilled on a vigreux column a 25% center cut being retained	which was then degassed under vacuum in the presence of f.	3.5494936036757387
7536. purified	inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described	above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a flask equipped with	a break seal.	5.72061537350086
7537. this chlorine-carbon tetrachloride solution was illuminated	for a day following which the flask was resealed onto a vacuum	system and the excess chlorine distilled off.	3.7733258245490027
7538. the required amount of	carbon tetrachloride was distilled into a series of reaction cells on	a manifold on a vacuum line.	5.406534985682719
7539. the desired amounts of inactive chlorine	and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on	the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold	as a whole was sealed off.	3.57668885816421
7540. the contents of the manifold for liquid phase	experiments were then mixed by shaking redistributed to the reaction	tubes frozen down and each tube was then sealed off.	4.67006175733894
7541. the reactants	for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a side-arm	attached to the manifold and then allowed to distil slowly into the manifold	of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing off.	3.4257605838034717
7542. this method	in general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations	reaction conditions	- the samples for liquid phase thermal reaction	studies were prepared in pyrex capillary tubing 2.	5.303777222321766
7543. 5 mm id and	about 15 cm long.	6.5090032722091
7544. in a few experiments the tubes were made from	standard 6 mm id pyrex tubing of 1 mm wall thickness.	6.137618130896889
7545. both	types of tube withstood the pressure of approximately 20 atmospheres	exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at 220`.	4.363909158347616
7546. the photochemical reaction	cells consisted of 10 mm id pyrex tubing 5.	5.506908456901043
7547. 5 cm	long diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed	through only liquid-glass interfaces and not gas-glass interfaces.	4.94865577464288
7548. these cells were used rather than square pyrex tubing because	of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon	tetrachloride.	5.664055694649872
7549. the round cells were reproducibly positioned in the	light beam which entered the thermostated mineral oil-bath through a window.	3.73554356116904
7550. two types of light source were used a thousand watt projection	lamp and an ah6 high pressure mercury arc.	5.663812057188363
7551. the light was filtered	by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that	only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride	could enter the reaction cell.	3.5051535364134363
7552. relative incident light intensities	were measured with a thermopile potentiometer system.	6.59805429633973
7553. changes of intensity	on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying	the distance of the light source from the cell.	4.111786876228656
7554. following reaction	the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a 20% aqueous	sodium iodide solution.	5.84974808897153
7555. carrier f was added and the aqueous and	organic phases were separated	.	4.535752126583474
7556. after	titration of the liberated f with f aliquots of the aqueous and	of the organic	phase were counted in a solution-type geiger tube.	5.103675880876918
7557. in the liquid	phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was	determined by weighing the tube before opening and weighing the fragments	after emptying.	4.114910302333261
7558. the fraction of exchange was determined as the	ratio of the countsminute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the	countsminute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for	equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon	tetrachloride empirically determined correction being made for the	difference in counting efficiency of f in f and f.	4.444656897188337
7559. in studying the liquid phase thermal	reaction some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold fillings were prepared	and analyzed.	4.215328024499788
7560. experiments were done at 180 200 210 220`.	6.806723317680827
7561. following	observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly	identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and	exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per	cent a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether	the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine	to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface	to volume ratio in the reaction tubes.	3.893877412413356
7562. in addition to the method	described in the section above chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared	by the electrolysis of a f eutectic on the vacuum line and by exchange	of f with molten f.	5.195639883235077
7563. calcium hydride was substituted for f	as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride.	4.442327690719724
7564. no correlation between	these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found.	6.4596088343462945
7565. the reaction rates observed at 200` ranged from f of the chlorine	exchanged per hour to 0.	3.8197367554446706
7566. in most cases the	chlorine	concentration was about f.	9.200906904168816
7567. sets of reaction tubes containing 0.	5.66037853959279
7568. 2 of	an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another	both gave reaction rates in the range of 0.	5.903256948790723
7569. 4 of the chlorine	exchanged per hour.	6.470437676255582
7570. no detectable reaction was found at room temperature	the liquid	- the liquid phase photochemical	exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible	than the thermal exchange although still erratic.	5.06803014522294
7571. the improvement	was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells	prepared as a group on the same manifold.	4.2840445879035585
7572. rather large differences were	still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings.	6.465039978833285
7573. some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in	the temperature range from 40 to 85` in a further endeavor to determine	the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on	the activation energy and the effect of light intensity.	3.73400847195587
7574. in all cases	there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of	illumination.	6.928416718185322
7575. by comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold	temperature dependency corresponding to activation energies ranging	from 11 to 18 f was observed while dependence on the first power of	the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases.	4.1634872785322425
7576. it	was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent	of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminated	for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions	based on the differences in the absorption spectra of uranyl	oxalate and of chlorine and considering the spectral distribution of	the light source.	4.679690045532465
7577. these estimates indicated that the quantum yield	for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at 65`	is of the order of magnitude of unity.	4.3848105464534335
7578. when typical reaction	cells to which 0.	8.81177663231035
7579. 3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated	chlorine and phosgene were produced.	4.836833870921789
7580. exchange was also observed	the photochemical	- although there was some variation	in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or	to variation in wall effects the photochemical exchange in the gas phase	was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare	the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose	of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration	and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate.	4.611012897928775
7581. data	on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity	are given in table 1.	4.652652566940365
7582. in series 1 the relative light	intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the	reaction cell over the range from 14.	5.221002242061542
7583. the last column	shows the rate of exchange that would have been oserved at a relative	intensity of 4 calculated on the assumptions that	the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square	of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly	proportional to the incident light intensity.	3.73211769456931
7584. direct proportionality	of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining	the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series 2	where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen.	5.210747640646428
7585. the poynting-robertson effect	which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles	by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging	solar radiation causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much	shorter than the age of the earth.	3.4223487589658865
7586. the radial velocity varies inversely	as the particle size- a 1000-|m-diameter particle near the	orbit of mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years.	4.818241178340229
7587. whipple	extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation	pressure which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag.	4.091788710050971
7588. further the corpuscular radiation ie the solar-wind protons	must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow	diminution in size with a resultant increase in both the poynting-robertson	effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational	force.	4.901314314952811
7589. the poynting-robertson effect causes the semi-major	axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis	with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move	toward the sun.	3.418595292505811
7590. also planetary gravitational attraction increases	the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is	approached.	6.0627891124288675
7591. at one astronomical unit from the sun	the dust orbits are probably nearly circular.	5.089191801677756
7592. if such is the case	the particles within a distance of about f km of the earth	will	have relative to the earth a kinetic energy less than their potential	energy and they will be captured into orbits about the earth.	5.397925425440887
7593. de	jager has calculated the times required for these particles	to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the poynting-robertson	effect which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more	eccentric	without changing the semi-major axis.	3.917252240733431
7594. this effect can give rise to	a blanket of micrometeorites around the earth.	6.05670322839548
7595. since there is	a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the	radiation effects there must be a continual replenishment: otherwise	micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary space.	4.140749025886731
7596. there	are several possible sources.	9.7465835513508
7597. according to whipple cometary	debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the	sun maintaining a fairly steady state.	4.463270901083843
7598. asteroidal collisions are also	thought to contribute material.	7.1581511048922275
7599. it is also possible that some of	the dust in the vicinity of the earth originated from meteoritic impacts	upon the moon.	4.798204400924747
7600. one cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite	flux in space.	6.771945903196035
7601. even in the neighborhood of the earth where information	has been obtained both directly and indirectly the derived flux	values vary by at least four orders of magnitude.	4.739715318610234
7602. this large discrepancy	demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the	lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved.	6.102003712651571
7603. beyond a	few million kilometers from the earth but still in the region of the	earth's orbit a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable.	4.21682140130143
7604. at greater distances from the sun the situation is still less	certain.	7.595877401808909
7605. there are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite	environment.	5.618130110242501
7606. direct information has been obtained from rockets	and satellites equipped with impact sensors.	5.926734816808145
7607. in addition the size	distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may	be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain.	4.4572444246318
7608. from the brightness of	the f component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal	light an estimate of the particle sizes concentrations and spatial	distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic	plane.	5.080684079903548
7609. another important source of evidence only recently receiving	much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic	component.	4.130172867308324
7610. the cores of deep-sea sediments and content of collectors	in remote regions are valuable in this category.	5.055834108035586
7611. the data provide a	measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the earth.	4.1835186564154885
7612. the direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the	earth is	obtained from piezoelectric sensors	and from wire gages; these instruments are installed on rockets satellites	and space probes.	4.669056410444599
7613. statistically the most significant data have	been collected from the sensors on 1958 alpha	1958 delta 2.	4.162654673811288
7614. these	vehicles with large sensitive areas have collected data for long enough	times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure.	5.103675880876918
7615. many other vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time products	contribute some information.	5.41724406730245
7616. the impact rate on 1958 alpha	for 153 events was f for particles of mass greater than f	; this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration	and an assumed impact velocity of f.	4.633660833714064
7617. the data show daily and diurnal	variations.	4.863391169911775
7618. ninety per cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred	between midnight and noon and from day to day the variation of the rate	was as much as an order of magnitude.	5.689044289741813
7619. one may conclude that most	of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams	which intersect the earth's orbit.	4.260478711379705
7620. there have been contradictory	reports from 1958 delta 2 and the data quoted here are believed	to be the more reliable.	6.5036161785323
7621. on may 15 a very large increase occurred	with f of mass between f and f; for the next two days	the impact rate was f; and for the next nine days the impact rate	was less than f.	4.399457692368587
7622. the data for the first day indicate	a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may	have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux.	6.084896149289051
7623. preliminary	data from 1959 eta give an average impact rate of f for masses	larger than f for about 1000 events in a 22-day period	.	3.725131536371901
7624. the day-to-day rate varied by less than a factor	of 4.	6.226120994799864
7625. the data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations.	4.200642402803407
7626. note that the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 alpha and	that the flux is one fifth as large.	5.691249274020508
7627. if one assumes that the average	flux did not change between measurements a mass-distribution curve is	obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius	to the inverse 72 power of the radius.	3.99693784321939
7628. space probes have	yielded little information.	8.342573371697748
7629. pioneer 1 recorded a decrease in flux	with distance from the earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours.	4.485569924740054
7630. with	detectors	sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts	the second and third russian space probes indicate that the flux	of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones.	5.265406488173454
7631. being based on so few events these results are of dubious validity.	4.813329520225036
7632. the calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle	parameters is very uncertain.	6.369875795452055
7633. many workers believe that the response	is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles a relation	deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic	velocities.	4.237634170306119
7634. however one must expect that vaporization and ejection	of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear	relationship.	5.666287171111874
7635. in the united states most of the sensors are calibrated	by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces.	5.621170659007909
7636. the	russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse	from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder	being momentum of ejected material from the sensor.	5.36934350346543
7637. this ejection	momentum is linearly related to the particle energy.	5.578153783816688
7638. they quote	about the same mass threshold as that of the us apparatus but	a momentum threshold about 40 times greater.	6.672841848960991
7639. there is a difference	in the experimental arrangement in that the us microphones are	attached directly to the vehicle skin while the russian instruments	are isolated from the skin.	4.5338201280882435
7640. the threshold mass is derived from the	momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of f	in the us work and f in the	ussr work.	4.641693229882493
7641. the threshold	mass of about f corresponds to a 10-|m-diameter sphere of	density f.	4.012715720819275
7642. however the conversion from mass to size is unreliable	since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy loosely bound	meteorite structure with densities as low as f.	5.763752515017693
7643. to what extent	such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown.	5.265232489508655
7644. the velocity	value used is also open to some question; if a substantial fraction	of the dust is orbiting about the earth only about one third the above-mentioned	average velocity should be used in deriving the mass.	5.020685150456728
7645. zodiacal	light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust	blanket a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture	is in circular orbits about the sun as indicated by the trend of the	smaller visible meteors.	3.842350614843675
7646. the diurnal variation in the observed flux	may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the	incident velocity.	5.189783048825249
7647. the flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood	of the earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and	visual meteor data.	3.671361806433594
7648. a summary of meteorite data prepared by whipple	on the basis of photographic visual and radar evidence	is given in table 5-1.	5.640757613135481
7649. from an estimated mass of 25 g for a	zero-magnitude meteorite the other masses are derived with the assumption	of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.	3.955485364770663
7650. 512 for each unit increase in	magnitude.	7.603896187885215
7651. the radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres	of density f except for the smallest particles which must have a	higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of	solar-radiation pressure.	3.721178384458551
7652. the flux values are for all particles with	masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the	numbers of visual meteors.	4.9605503401348985
7653. it is assumed that the flux values increase	by a factor of 2.	4.877546527224921
7654. 512 per magnitude in accordance with the opinion	that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant.	5.514022836406316
7655. the values agree with the data from 1958 alpha and 1959 eta.	4.111669881268149
7656. the figures	in the next-to-last column are derived with the assumption of 50	per cent shielding by the earth; hence these figures apply immediately	above the earth's atmosphere.	4.669145759890817
7657. the unshielded flux is given	in the last column; these figures constitute the best estimate for the	flux in interplanetary space near the earth.	3.5473748551672966
7658. of course if there	is a dust blanket around the earth the fluxes in interplanetary space	should be less than the figures given here.	6.0909895804216365
7659. note that the mass	scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously	used; for example jacchia derived a scale of 0.	4.147325129688584
7660. 15 g for	a f zero-magnitude meteorite.	7.731590058625686
7661. the older scales were based on theoretical	estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into	light.	3.903913139966551
7662. the mass scale used in table 5-1 was derived on the assumption	that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum	transfer to the trail by the meteorite permitting the calculation of	the mass if the velocity is known.	4.600701748994728
7663. a concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations	sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude.	4.270458923054784
7664. extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers	the range of micrometeorites.	5.926734816808145
7665. the approximate equation is f	where n	is the number of f with electron line-density greater than	or equal to f and q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite.	3.695409427474399
7666. therefore n is inversely proportional to the radius cubed	and in fair agreement with the inverse 72 power derived from 1958 alpha	and 1959 eta data.	5.1563429475336
7667. at the fifteenth magnitude f and at the twenty-fifth	magnitude f.	6.198920967157901
7668. these extrapolated fluxes are about an order	of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the	figures in whipple's table.	5.627035399486013
7669. the extrapolation may be in error for	several reasons.	4.922002226145906
7670. the observational data determining the concentration	distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension	into the micrometeorite region.	4.952314742935517
7671. the solar-electromagnetic- and	corpuscular-radiation	pressure and the associated poynting-robertson effect	increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify	the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns.	3.497096702798228
7672. also	it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may	not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites	and the same distribution would not be expected.	6.407746889476714
7673. of micrometeorite flux	a measure of the total mass accretion	of meteoritic material by the earth is obtained from analyses of	deep-sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions	.	4.125303474520917
7674. most meteoritic material by the time it reaches the earth's	surface has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material	in its passage through the atmosphere.	5.701367510100346
7675. for all meteorites the average	nickel content is about 2.	5.785559287012306
7676. this is much higher than the	nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis	for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx.	5.528604809701057
7677. present data	indicate an accretion of about f tons per year over the entire globe	or about f.	4.189999966377443
7678. biological warfare is the intentional use of	living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying	or reducing the military effectiveness of man.	5.3446255698423695
7679. it is the exploitation	of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific	research and development resulting in the production of bw	weapons systems.	4.428225999244087
7680. man may also be injured secondarily by damage to	his food crops or domestic animals.	6.727332517316316
7681. biological warfare is considered	to be primarily a strategic weapon.	4.855658467968249
7682. the major reason for this	is that it has no quick-kill effect.	7.142737853212844
7683. the incubation period of infectious	disease plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect	render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter.	3.5473748551672966
7684. a man	can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period	of most infectious diseases.	5.61618342048764
7685. thus an enemy would probably use this weapon	for attack on static population centers such as large cities.	4.390101277304171
7686. an important operational procedure in bw for an enemy would	be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area.	5.259064580175611
7687. this	concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of	particulate biological materials the pathogenesis of respiratory infections	the medical management of such diseases and defense against their	occurrence.	3.6345709407778486
7688. the biological and physical properties of infectious	particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen	years.	5.649814519147625
7689. much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed	for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols	of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional	characteristics.	3.8430028608922515
7690. much information has been gathered relative to quantitative	sampling and assesment techniques.	6.812007724078037
7691. much of the older experimental	work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial	procedures.	5.497888014072812
7692. the intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious	agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure	through natural respiration to aerosolized organisms.	4.730701665605607
7693. the	importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated.	4.5796824776775376
7694. the natural anatomical and physiological defensive features	of the upper respiratory tract such as the turbinates of the nose and	the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi are capable of impinging	out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily	existence.	4.913386288340856
7695. very small particles however in a size range of 1 to	4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers	and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs.	3.8087151001579396
7696. this area is highly susceptible	to infection.	7.868635035332621
7697. the entrance and retention of infectious particles	in the alveoli amounts almost to an intratissue inoculation.	4.047573047182283
7698. the	relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated	in table 1.	6.093123995732186
7699. in considering bw defense it must be recognized	that a number of critical meterological parameters must be met for	an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect.	4.527388718914488
7700. for example bright sunlight	is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air.	6.904545100246854
7701. there	are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne.	5.107382135220606
7702. neutral or inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a	cloud to travel along the surface.	5.824161186330043
7703. it will rise during lapse conditions.	7.40570921770135
7704. there are of course certain times during the 24-hour daily cycle	when most of these conditions will be met.	6.442076465913757
7705. certain other properties	of small particles in addition to those already mentioned in	connection with penetration of the respiratory tract are noteworthy	in defense considerations.	4.246302666297868
7706. the smaller the particle the further it will	travel downwind before settling out.	5.3903136109608445
7707. an aerosol of such small particles.	6.289211072338518
7708. moreover diffuses through structures in much the same manner as	a gas.	8.589359955517697
7709. there may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion	through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens	restaurants food stores hospitals etc.	5.081577909588992
7710. depending on the organism	there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products ie	in milk for example.	5.674909110162678
7711. the secondary consequences from this could	be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for	defense.	4.614060554648273
7712. something of the behavior of clouds of small particles	can be illustrated by the following field trials:   in the	first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling	some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological	conditions.	5.0364367355862765
7713. zinc cadmium sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were	disseminated.	4.535752126583474
7714. this material fluoresces under ultraviolet light which	facilitates its sampling and assessment.	6.235752476069656
7715. four hundred and fifty pounds	was disseminated while the ship was traveling a distance of 156	miles.	4.707458710186362
7716. figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial.	6.522871687113793
7717. the particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some 450 miles.	4.099370333146802
7718. from these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34000	square miles was covered.	7.12498892532853
7719. these dosages could have been increased	by increasing the source strength which was small in this case.	4.633305032963158
7720. the behavior of a biological aerosol on a much smaller scale is illustrated	by a specific field trial conducted with a non-pathogenic organism.	4.875034741801757
7721. an aqueous suspension of the spores of b subtilis var	niger generally known as bacillus globigii was aerosolized	using commercially available nozzles.	4.112368241242139
7722. a satisfactory cloud was produced	even though these nozzles were only about 5 per cent efficient in	producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns.	5.1839715798565225
7723. in this	test 130 gallons of a suspension having a count of f organisms	per ml or a total of approximately f spores was aerosolized.	4.0721482678849625
7724. the	spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small naval	vessel cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-sure breeze.	5.306883000786785
7725. spraying continued along a two-mile course.	5.66037853959279
7726. this operation	was started at 5:00 pm and lasted for 29 minutes.	6.235752476069656
7727. there was	a slight lapse condition a moderate fog and 100 per cent relative	humidity.	5.007976387637493
7728. a network of sampling stations had been set up on shore.	6.676025920293525
7729. these	were located at the homes of government employees in government	offices buildings and reservations within the trial area.	3.996502389132312
7730. a rough	attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by	taking samples from outside the windows on the first ninth and fifteenth	floors of a government office building.	5.577415999546072
7731. all samplers were	operated for a period of two hours except one which was operated	for four hours.	4.985847772120257
7732. in this instance there was a dosage of 562 during the	first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four-hour period	a four-fold increase.	5.805471348132033
7733. this suggests that the sampling period particularly	at the more distant locations should have been increased.	4.560326111534383
7734. as can be seen from figure 2 an extensive area was covered by this	aerosol.	6.978875880986018
7735. the maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source.	4.200503664751411
7736. as can be seen from these dosage isopleths approximately 100 square	miles was covered within the area sampled.	6.302046076901658
7737. it is quite likely that	an even greater area was covered particularly downwind.	5.207943745853089
7738. the dosages	in the three levels of the vertical profile were: f   this was	not of course enough sampling to give a satisfactory description	of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol.	4.801758595529793
7739. a number of unique medical	problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious	agent through the respiratory route rather than by the natural portal	of entry.	4.212959418400998
7740. some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious	to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle	size than by the natural portal.	5.3028650435049665
7741. botulinal toxin for example is several	thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os.	4.060235568763422
7742. in some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from	this route of exposure making diagnosis difficult.	6.193786614794088
7743. in tularemia produced	by aerosol exposure one would not expect to find the classical	ulcer of rabbit fever on a finger.	4.486094322886018
7744. an enemy would obviously	choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious.	6.714977205994818
7745. agents	that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers	such as those causing q fever tularemia brucellosis glanders	coccidioidomycosis etc belong in this category.	3.7976722852565925
7746. an agent	would	likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence	stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements.	5.644907441465999
7747. it	is obviously a proper goal of research to improve on this property.	4.854667000300735
7748. in this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without	excessive destruction.	8.341195177970292
7749. moreover it should not be so fastidious in	its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant	scale improbable.	4.729189346525724
7750. an aggressor would use an agent against	which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced	immunity in a target population.	5.886324603188227
7751. a solid immunity is the one effective	circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized.	4.322262450091603
7752. it must be remembered however that there are many agents for which	there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be	broken by an appropriate dose of agent.	5.94808327909752
7753. there is a broad spectrum	of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose	might be made.	4.710895710751804
7754. an enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism	a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality.	5.596293414950129
7755. it is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced	such as antibiotic resistant strains.	5.02494131811462
7756. mutants may also be developed	with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in	identification.	6.142940442770809
7757. all of these considerations are of critical importance	in considering defense and medical management.	5.478986776367038
7758. biological agents	are of course highly host-specific.	7.603896187885215
7759. they do not destroy physical	structures as is true of high explosives.	6.102985810144642
7760. this may be of overriding	importance in considering military objectives.	8.986624875328587
7761. the question	of epidemic disease merits some discussion.	4.641934589711508
7762. only a limited effort has	been devoted to this problem.	7.946360307921188
7763. some of those who question the value	of bw have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment	of epidemics.	5.542715251087509
7764. they then point out that with our present lack	of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall	of epidemics it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated.	5.3827877240867
7765. they argue further that our knowledge	and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control	such an outbreak of disease.	4.074012177613654
7766. this is why this approach to bw	defense has not been given major attention.	7.512750557974913
7767. our major problem	is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target.	4.662737090751071
7768. this	of course does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose	agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease.	5.368720319504203
7769. a hypothetical	example will illustrate this point.	5.582714954590994
7770. let us assume that it would	be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent	of epidemic typhus over city a and	that a large number of cases of typhus fever resulted therefrom.	5.279777857438431
7771. no epidemic	was initiated nor was one expected because the population in city	a was not lousy.	4.442552725349841
7772. lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic typhus.	7.1581511048922275
7773. in this case then the military objective was accomplished with	an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial	attack.	4.425615775848317
7774. this was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic.	8.155460065373152
7775. on the other hand a similar attack might have been made on city	b whose population was known to be lousy.	5.235731377351398
7776. one might expect some	spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness	of the attack.	6.779842004178551
7777. the major defensive problems are concerned	with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from	appropriate disseminating devices.	4.277361071149232
7778. it should be no more difficult	to deliver such devices than other weapons.	8.221369699382256
7779. the same delivery vehicles-	whether they be airplanes submarines or guided missiles- should	be usable.	4.380624317980511
7780. if it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on	a city it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent	over that city.	6.411236430024877
7781. biological agents are moreover suitable	for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense.	4.131860641767443
7782. a few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned.	6.922635681092565
7783. the air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are	subject to attack.	4.290983203159044
7784. america is rapidly becoming a nation that uses	processed precooked and even predigested foods.	6.434338937901648
7785. this is an enormous	industry that is subject to sabotage.	6.422713533977587
7786. one must include the preparation	of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products.	6.22104180263303
7787. huge	industries are involved also in the production of biological products	drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack.	4.494365866729306
7788. a variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation	and study of blood group antibodies.	6.105031696169859
7789. these include low-temperature	ethanol fractionation electrophoresis ultracentrifugation and	column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses.	4.853946671655876
7790. modifications of	the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators.	5.926734816808145
7791. abelson and rawson using a stepwise elution scheme fractionated	whole sera containing abo and rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl	deae cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose.	3.7992019768996257
7792. speer	and coworkers in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole	sera used a series of gradients for elution from deae-cellulose.	5.874748763852517
7793. fahey and morrison used a single continuous gradient at constant	ph for the fractionation of anti-a and anti-b agglutinins	from preisolated |g-globulin samples.	3.7992019768996257
7794. in the	present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on	deae-cellulose	using single gradients similar to those described	by sober and peterson and certain chemical and serological properties	of the fractions containing antibodies of the abo and rh	systems have been described.	4.65653549388991
7795. serum samples were obtained from normal group a group b	and group o donors.	4.305414028832856
7796. three of the anti-rh sera used were taken	from recently sensitized individuals.	7.595558906101067
7797. one contained complete antibody	and had a titer of 1:512 in saline.	4.968782988500926
7798. the second contained incomplete	antibody and showed titers of 1:256 in albumin and 1:2048 by	the indirect coombs test.	5.478257465775604
7799. the third containing the mixed type of complete	and incomplete antibodies had titers of 1:256 in saline 1:512	in albumin and 1:1024 by the indirect coombs test.	3.6539864071628774
7800. in addition	one serum was obtained from a donor who had been sensitized	6 years previously.	6.46460563665441
7801. this serum exhibited titers of 1:16 in albumin	and 1:256 by the indirect coombs test.	4.294948575713688
7802. these antibody titers	serological	anti-a and anti-b activities were determined	in fractions from the sera of group a group b or group o	donors by the following tube agglutination methods.	5.019415432288881
7803. one drop of each	sample was added to one drop of a 2% suspension of group f or	group b red cells in a small f test tube.	4.0116650736471735
7804. in several instances	group o cells were also used as controls.	7.141060022811298
7805. the red cells were used	within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline	before use.	3.7573813922746004
7806. the mixtures of sample plus cell suspension were allowed	to stand at room temperature for 1 hr.	5.055834108035586
7807. the tubes were then	centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined macroscopically for	agglutination.	3.907287688816378
7808. for the albumin method equal volumes of 30% bovine	albumin sample and 2% cells suspended in saline were allowed to	stand at room temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuged at 1000	rpm for 1 min.	4.952566938216322
7809. all samples were tested by both the saline and	albumin methods.	5.170701220847109
7810. the activities of fractions of sera containing rh	antibodies were tested by the saline albumin and indirect coombs	techniques.	5.104645353158631
7811. homozygous and heterozygous f cells f and homozygous	and heterozygous f cells were used to test each sample; however	in the	interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with	homozygous f and homozygous f cells will be presented here.	3.5065062327641723
7812. the saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the abo	samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37`c	before centrifugation.	4.854701917142027
7813. the saline tubes were saved and used	for	the indirect coombs test in the following manner.	4.295739431709338
7814. the cells were washed	three times with saline anti-human serum was added the cells were	resuspended and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min	and examined for agglutination.	4.643027691202085
7815. the anti-human sera used were prepared	by injecting whole human serum into rabbits.	4.012715720819275
7816. those antisera shown	by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the broad spectrum type were	selected for used in the present study.	7.090945279847754
7817. the red cells for the	rh antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except	for the f cells which had been glycerolized and stored at -20`c	for approximately 1 year.	3.5748788064546444
7818. these cells were thawed at 37`c for 30	min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing	with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions	.	5.275871774150518
7819. the cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended	to 2% in saline.	3.872342767520762
7820. blood samples were	allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 hr centrifuged and the	serum	was removed.	5.597594284676194
7821. the serum was measured volumetrically and subsequently	dialyzed in the cold for at least 24 hr against three to four changes	approximately 750 ml each of starting buffer.	3.9314578562396707
7822. 6 was 0.	10.409711038655146
7823. 005 m in f and 0.	5.66037853959279
7824. 039 m in	tris-aminomethane	.	10.109203984689895
7825. after dialysis the sample was centrifuged	and the supernatant placed on a f cm column of eeae-cellulose	equilibrated with starting buffer.	4.253187427533905
7826. 78 meq of ng was prepared in our laboratory	by the method of peterson and sober from powdered cellulose 100-230	mesh.	5.439805050887269
7827. the small amount of insoluble material which precipitated	during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting buffer	centrifuged resuspended in 2.	3.641122878525005
7828. 5 ml of isotonic saline and tested	for antibody activity.	7.726330289353742
7829. the chromatography was done at 6`c	using gradient elution essentially according to sober and peterson.	3.872342767520762
7830. the deep concave gradient employed was obtained with	a nine-chambered gradient elution device	and has been described elsewhere.	5.166683510682946
7831. the other a shallow concave	gradient was produced with a so-called cone-sphere	apparatus the cone being a 2-liter erlenmeyer flask	and the sphere a 2-liter round-bottom flask.	3.752226369144554
7832. each initially contained	1700 ml of buffer; in the sphere was starting buffer and	in the cone was final buffer 0.	5.536513092291082
7833. 50 m in both f and tris ph	4.	5.774122245690223
7834. a flow rate of 72 f was used and 12 ml fractions were collected.	5.71713969833555
7835. approximately 165 fractions were obtained from each column.	5.066959048406199
7836. these were read at 280 m|m in a beckman model du spectrophotometer	paper	electrophoresis.	6.415606383876523
7837. fractions from the	column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5`c	or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted	simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic	saline.	3.521363359503313
7838. during the latter procedure the temperature was maintained	at 2`c by surrounding the apparatus with ice.	6.245464564313923
7839. because negative	pressure	dialysis gave better recovery of proteins permitted detection	of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler	procedure it was used in all but the earliest experiments.	4.301065438781709
7840. paper	electrophoresis was carried out on the concentrated samples in a spinco	model r cell using barbital buffer ph 8.	5.817729820672398
7841. 075 at room temperature on whatman 3mm filter paper.	4.855658467968249
7842. five	milliamperescell were applied for 18 hr after which the strips	were stained with bromphenol blue and densitometry was carried out using	a spinco analytrol.	5.051766433984403
7843. when paper electrophoresis was to be	used for preparation eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic	fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were runchamber	under the conditions described above.	3.7790930156683973
7844. at the end of the run	the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried	stained for 1 hr washed and dried while the other strips were	maintained in a horizontal position at 1`c.	5.474325386400705
7845. the unstained strips	were	then marked using the stained ones as a guide and cut transversely	so as to separate the various protein bands.	3.601249690094506
7846. the strip sections containing	a given protein were pooled eluted with 0.	5.506908456901043
7847. 5 ml of isotonic	saline and the eluates were tested for antibody activity.	5.062575583879994
7848. fractions from the column which were to be subjected	to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure	dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at least 500	volumes of phosphate-buffered saline ph 7.	5.211915977964451
7849. they were then centrifuged at 59780 rpm for 35 to 80 min	at 20`c in a spinco model e ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration	of 1.	3.951747785289312
7850. sedimentation coefficients were computed	as f values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated	from the schlieren patterns.	5.524970605594631
7851. for preparative ultracentrifugation	fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure	dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less transferred to cellulose	tubes and diluted to 12 ml with isotonic saline.	3.675873800149599
7852. ultracentrifugation	was then carried out in a spinco model l ultracentrifuge at	40000 rpm for 125 to 150 min refrigeration being used throughout	the run.	5.2716388005078985
7853. successive 1-ml fractions were then drawn off with a	hypodermic syringe starting at the top of the tube and tested for agglutinin	activity.	4.657852434640034
7854. other methods will be described below.	8.656321719480228
7855. the insoluble material which precipitated	during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin	activity regardless of the blood group of the donor.	3.9578574459786453
7856. with either	of the gradients described chromatography on deae-cellulose	separated agglutinins of the abo series into at least three regions	: one of extremely low anionic binding capacity	one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding	capacity.	5.186601331683838
7857. these have been labeled regions 1 2 and 4 respectively	in fig 1.	4.695240293057451
7858. when the early part of the gradient was flattened	either by using the gradient shown in fig 2 or by allowing the cone-sphere	gradient to become established more slowly region 2 activity	could sometimes be separated into two areas	.	5.705910989905422
7859. the latter	procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak between	regions 1 and 2.	4.530098801558585
7860. in 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of	agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected	.	5.375065254155597
7861. moreover after concentration using negative	pressure dialysis agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected	in the region designated 2a	.	4.429029792440735
7862. not all these regions exhibited equal	agglutinating activity as evidenced by titer and the extent of the	active areas.	6.518728036143511
7863. in all cases most of the activity lay in the region of	high anionic binding capacity.	5.950853751395769
7864. this was particularly noticeable in group	a and group b sera in which cases activity in regions 1	and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally	could not be detected at all.	4.981481299814135
7865. there appeared to be no difference	in the distribution of anti-a and anti-b activity in group	o serum though in two group o donors	only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic	binding capacity.	4.256876493135503
7866. several samples of	citrated plasma were fractionated in our laboratory by method 6 of cohn	et al.	5.998741899489748
7867. these fractions were tested for abo agglutinin	activity using fractions from group ab plasma as a control.	4.232190070137743
7868. as expected most of the activity was found in fraction f with	slight activity seen in fraction 4-1.	6.686148996508177
7869. a sample of fraction f	from group o plasma was dissolved in starting buffer dialyzed against	this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown	in fig 2.	3.7397729059835005
7870. once again both anti-a and anti-b activities	were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis.	7.008077182495757
7871. similarly both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the	chromatographic eluate having extremely low low and high anionic	binding capacity respectively.	3.922316469548602
7872. chromatography of	whole sera revealed that the areas of rh antibody activity were generally	continuous and wide.	5.710979968372182
7873. the incomplete antibody activity appeared	in the early part of the chromatogram; the complete in the latter	part.	4.469462804140441
7874. the serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete	antibodies showed activity in both regions.	5.124518734431128
7875. in all cases	the activity against f cells was spread over a wider area than that	with f cells regardless of the type of test	used for comparison.	4.524242125352149
7876. the insoluble material resulting	from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity.	5.390500575037483
7877. in	fact agglutination of f cells in saline could be produced by the	insoluble material from sera containing only incomplete antibody	activity.	3.9047121588713347
7878. this was later known to be the result of concentrating the	minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera; when the insoluble	fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of	the original serum sample no complete antibody activity could be detected.	5.356133168894966
7879. apart from the honeybee practically all bees and bumblebees	hibernate in a state of torpor.	5.2637717802067
7880. occasionally you may come across one	or two bumblebees in the cold season when you are turning over sods	in your garden but you have to be a really keen observer to see them	at all.	6.247841426960491
7881. they keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their	bodies and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well	mistake them for lumps of dirt.	4.036032401129938
7882. i must add at once that these animals	are what we call queens young females that have mated in the previous	summer or autumn.	5.430824761915665
7883. it is on them alone that the future of their	race depends for all their relatives	have perished with the arrival of the cold weather.	4.599921222882983
7884. even some of the queens will die before the winter is over falling	prey to enemies or disease.	6.838128693956658
7885. the survivors emerge on some nice sunny	day in march or april when the temperature is close to 50` f	and there is not too much wind.	4.125047835100353
7886. now the thing for us to do is to find	ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the	red ribes sanguineum of our pacific northwest or otherwise a	good sloe tree or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom preferably	one with male or staminate catkins.	5.281714202272664
7887. the blooms of ribes and of	the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects	will assemble: honeybees bumblebees and other wild bees and	also various kinds of flies.	3.5520348436467497
7888. it is a happy buzzing crowd.	9.38154089296143
7889. each	male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers.	5.406777728305719
7890. it is not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always	arranged in pairs and that each individual flower is nothing but one	such pair standing on a green black-tipped little scale.	5.748323052834323
7891. by scrutinizing	the flowers one can also notice that the scale bears one or two	tiny warts.	4.423403845799093
7892. those are the nectaries or honey glands	.	8.419480063502792
7893. the staminate willow catkins then provide their visitors with	both nectar and pollen; a marvelous arrangement for it provides	exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread a combination	of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed.	3.4682939222897478
7894. the	only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites.	6.13607296909417
7895. i	will deal with these later on.	5.66037853959279
7896. quite often honeybees form a	majority on the willow catkins.	7.098773703336195
7897. as we have already seen in the first	chapter bumblebees are bigger hairier and much more colorful than honeybees	exhibiting various combinations of black yellow white and	orange.	4.595465500341729
7898. let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game and	let us just call them bombus; there must be several dozen species	in the	united states alone.	5.734447421462723
7899. if you really insist on knowing their names	an excellent book on the north american species is bumblebees and	their ways by o e plath.	4.278838228556342
7900. if we manage to keep track	of a bombus queen after she has left her feeding place we may	discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself	when she woke up from her winter sleep.	4.995903670848946
7901. as befits a queen a bumblebee	female is rather choosy and may spend considerable time searching for	a suitable nesting place.	4.124525134549778
7902. most species seem to prefer a ready-made	hollow such as a deserted mouse nest a bird house or the hole made	by a woodpecker; some show a definite liking for making their nest in	moss.	5.146577995222095
7903. once she has made up her mind the queen starts out by constructing	in her chosen abode a small floor of dried grass or some	woolly material.	3.9121403161888026
7904. on this she builds an egg compartment or egg	cell which is filled with that famous pollen-and-nectar mixture	called beebread.	6.043012859990127
7905. she also builds one or two waxen cups which she fills	with honey.	5.624194353923653
7906. then a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the	beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed.	6.206915310745472
7907. the queen afterward	keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen taking a sip	from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots.	3.6555899080909233
7908. when	the larvae hatch they feed on the beebread although they also receive	extra honey meals from their mother.	5.599140021399795
7909. she continues to add to the	pollen supply as needed.	5.862553457708852
7910. the larvae kept warm by the queen	are full grown in about ten days.	5.289832921804139
7911. each now makes a tough papery cocoon	and pupates.	5.665895349263116
7912. after another two weeks the first young emerge four	to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker bees	collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young	generation while the queen retires to a life of egg laying.	5.721041408414785
7913. the first	worker bees do not mate or lay eggs; males and mating females do not	emerge until later in the season.	3.7875529292528007
7914. the broods of workers that appear	later tend to be bigger than the first ones probably because they are	better fed.	5.461167788887066
7915. by the middle of the summer many of the larvae apparently	receive such a good diet that it is optimal and it is then	that young queens begin to appear.	5.437848789725472
7916. simultaneously males or drones are	produced mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers although a	few may be produced by the queen.	5.1874962597884675
7917. the young queens and drones leave the	nest and mate and after a short period of freedom the fertilized	young	queens will begin to dig in for the winter.	3.775076681395285
7918. it is an amazing fact that	in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full	swing for instance in august.	5.756784989929781
7919. the temperature then is still very	high.	5.057856772203119
7920. at the old nest the queen will in the early fall cease to lay	the fertilized eggs that will produce females.	6.164936605962905
7921. as a result the proportion	of males increases and eventually the old	colony will die out completely.	5.073148692484897
7922. the nest itself the structure that	in some cases housed about 2000 individuals when the season was at its	peak is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain	beetles and moths.	4.625409175914988
7923. not always though does the development of	a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described.	5.075483388636414
7924. some members of the bee family have become idlers social parasites	that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives.	6.823268238721179
7925. bumblebees	can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of psithyrus the	cuckoo-bumblebee as it is called in some european countries.	4.400000046402277
7926. female individuals of psithyrus look deceptively like the workers	and queens of the bumblebees they victimize.	5.550554466109728
7927. the one sure way to tell	victim and villain apart is to examine the hind legs which in the	case of the idler psithyrus lack the pollen baskets- naturally!	the female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest	of her host.	3.6779228883958126
7928. when she succeeds she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively	to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the	bumblebees seal the egg compartment.	5.373624434626581
7929. the hosts never seem to recognize	that something is amiss so that the compartment afterward is sealed	normally.	4.232417194317309
7930. thus the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense	of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread.	6.077300499815015
7931. later on they	and the mother psithyrus are fed by the bombus workers.	5.097702819157361
7932. worse still in a number of cases it has been claimed that the psithyrus	female kills off the bombus queen.	6.417250040564039
7933. but let us return	after this gruesome interlude to our willow catkins in the spring;	there are other wild bees that command our attention.	4.024699092531897
7934. it	is almost certain that some of these usually a trifle smaller than the	honeybees are andrenas or mining bees.	6.54339060674585
7935. there are about 200 different	kinds of andrena in europe alone.	5.531535184963606
7936. one of my favorites is a	armata a species very common in england where it is sometimes	referred to as the lawn bee.	6.549779983650396
7937. the females like to burrow in the short	turf of well-kept lawns where their little mounds of earth often appear	by the hundreds.	3.5754695776410808
7938. almost equal in size to a honeybee.	8.225583361287285
7939. a armata	is much more beautiful in color at least in the female of the species:	a rich velvety rusty red.	4.174666273462686
7940. the males are much duller.	6.916419102612548
7941. after having mated an andrena female digs a hole straight down	into the ground forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil.	4.4562415284148305
7942. the bottom part of a burrow has a number of side tunnels or cells	each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread.	6.000513577189058
7943. the	development of the andrena larvae is very rapid so that by the	end of spring they have already pupated and become adults.	3.876351786477489
7944. but they	are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout	the summer fall and winter.	5.716111592903478
7945. their appearance next spring coincides	in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants.	4.406691061974044
7946. in the sacramento valley in california for instance it has been observed	that there was not one day's difference between the emergence	of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins.	5.9017477601058115
7947. this must be	due to a completely identical response to the weather in the plant and	the animal.	4.747814520553368
7948. after the male and female andrenas have mated	the cycle is repeated.	7.122997276302844
7949. although andrena is gregarious so that we	may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together we must still call	it a solitary bee.	4.076878331542105
7950. its life history is much simpler than that of the	truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life	cycle of many other species.	6.6188093102249175
7951. after all social life in the group of	the bees is by no means general although it certainly is a striking	feature.	5.389607658642227
7952. on the basis of its life history we like to think that andrena	is more primitive than the bumblebees.	6.881480480606168
7953. the way in which it transports	its pollen is not so perfect either.	6.055867381464014
7954. it lacks pollen baskets	and possesses only a large number of long branched hairs on its legs	on which the pollen grains will collect.	5.807734597337795
7955. still andrena will	do a reasonably good job so that an animal with a full pollen load looks	like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind.	4.05943021019976
7956. closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees.	6.888555761659698
7957. nomia	melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of	the united states west of the great plains for example in utah	and central washington.	5.122887970364154
7958. in the united states department of agriculture's	yearbook of agriculture 1952 which is devoted entirely	to insects george e bohart mentions a site in utah which	was estimated to contain 200000 nesting females.	5.4280740019093185
7959. often the burrows	are only an inch or two apart and the bee cities cover several acres.	4.46950923222447
7960. the life history of the alkali bee is similar to that of andrena	but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer	and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage.	5.186573299515237
7961. in most places	there are two generations a year a second brood of adults appearing	late in the summer.	4.358298174411469
7962. i must plead guilty to a special sympathy	for nomias.	7.538481764483632
7963. this may just be pride in my adopted state of washington	but certainly i love to visit their mound cities near yakima and	prosser in july or august when the bees are in their most active	period.	3.7031607831739852
7964. the name alkali bee indicates that one has to look for	them in rather inhospitable places.	5.7896019259703175
7965. sometimes although by no means	always these are indeed alkaline.	5.449556966879603
7966. the thing is that these bees love	a fine-grained soil that is moist; yet the water in the ground should	not be stagnant either.	5.280004180189393
7967. where does	one find such conditions?	7.423081379936514
7968.  the best chance of course is offered by	gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and	where the air is dry so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits	which permit only sparse plant growth.	5.511764188853852
7969. many other snakes at maturity are already more	than half their final length.	5.0128905873554634
7970. laurence m klauber put length at maturity	at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes and charles	c carpenter's data on michigan garter and ribbon snakes	show that the smallest gravid females are more than	half as long as the biggest adults.	4.955411624172483
7971. felix kopstein states that when	the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal	length but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception	with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity.	3.5434088196138775
7972. it is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow	appreciably after attaining maturity; he was working with species	of java so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect.	5.375536874283829
7973. certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable	difference after maturity but it is impossible to know whether this	is due to captive conditions.	4.304979450920648
7974. additional records of slow growth have	been omitted.	7.594335062792461
7975. it is possible to make a few generalizations about	the six giants themselves.	6.333000460807043
7976. there seems to be a rough correlation	between the initial and ultimate lengths starting with the smallest	and ending with the largest.	7.190964890665672
7977. data on the	former are scanty but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes	born at a length greater than that of any of the others thereby	lending support to the belief that the anaconda does indeed attain	the greatest length.	4.569977667500817
7978. for four of the six	there is also a correlation	between size at maturity and maximum length the boa constrictor	being the smallest and the indian python the next in size at the	former stage.	5.256198002143801
7979. let us speculate a little on the maximum size	of the anaconda.	5.883370199357393
7980. if in a certain part of the range it starts life 1	foot longer than do any of the other giants and reaches	maturity at let us guess 18 inches longer than the others a	quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of	40 feet.	5.980414301721512
7981. when it comes to rate of early growth the indian	python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the	first two years more or less.	4.156302753949498
7982. the african rock python a close second	is followed in turn by the reticulate python.	5.201876437247893
7983. there are few data	on the boa constrictor those for the anaconda are unconvincing and	there is nothing at all on the amethystine python.	4.453100544531684
7984. it seems likely that	the indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have	been made more carefully and frequently; it responds exceptionally	well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to	keep.	5.193856263869798
7985. i cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity	growth; at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches	rather than feet.	5.427482812088249
7986. until better records have been kept over longer	periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions	it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions.	5.453069069733021
7987. it is often	stated	that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity but	this apparently is an overestimation.	4.3299456649741925
7988. the best way to determine the	correct figure is by direct observation of pairs isolated	from birth a method that produced surprising results: maturing of	a male indian python in less than two years his mate in less than three;	data on the boa constrictor about match this.	4.98637094485019
7989. another approach	is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at	maturity.	4.9280506607195775
7990. results from this approach amply confirm the direct observations:	about three years are required there being a possible slight	difference between males and females in the time required.	4.981436963190621
7991. only the	amethystine python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity	of data.	4.6476765555391015
7992. the following information on snakes varying greatly	in size shows when considered	with the foregoing that there is probably no correlation between	the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature.	5.154043912516527
7993. oliver	in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the united states	could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition	to the rattlers which i shall consider separately.	4.092006731155346
7994. these three	were much alike: lined snake one year and	nine months; red-bellied snake two years; cottonmouth	two years.	5.685332476552206
7995. klauber investigated the rattlesnakes	carefully himself and also summarized what others have found.	4.411891185517149
7996. he	concluded that in the southern species which are rapidly growing types	females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young	when they are three.	6.1091254470650025
7997. other herpetologists have ascertained that in	the northern united states the prairie rattlesnake may not give first	birth until it is four or even five years old and that the young may	be born every other year rather than annually.	3.949282242195145
7998. carpenter's study	showed that female common garter and ribbon snakes of michigan mature	at about the age of two.	5.926406216047044
7999. oversized monsters are	never brought home either alive or preserved and field measurements	are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate	dimensions.	4.087288139519799
8000. measurements of skins are of little value; every	snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching	presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer.	5.025020029471358
8001. in	spite of all the pitfalls there is a certain amount of agreement on	some of the giants.	5.158212579626619
8002. the anaconda proves to be the fly in the ointment	but the reason for this is not clear; the relatively wild conditions	still found in tropical south america might be responsible.	5.821810828360531
8003. there are three levels on which to treat the subject.	6.200454921942639
8004. the first is	the strictly scientific which demands concrete proof and therefore may	err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh.	5.257777717385663
8005. this	approach rejects virtually all field measurements.	5.66037853959279
8006. the next level	attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced sensible conclusion;	field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected	and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated.	5.045717440048942
8007. the third level leans on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire.	4.777959108919227
8008. the argument against this last approach is comparable to that which	rejects stories about hoop snakes about snakes that break themselves	into many pieces and join up again or even of ghosts that chase people	out of graveyards; the mere piling up of testimony does not prove	to the scientific mind the existence of hoop snakes joint snakes	or ghosts.	4.536244462674305
8009. oliver has recently used the second-level approach	with the largest snakes and has come to these conclusions: the anaconda	reaches a length of at least 37 feet the reticulate python 33	the african rock python 25 the amethystine python at least 22 the indian	python 20 and the boa constrictor 18-12.	3.458686139277494
8010. bernard heuvelmans	also treats of the largest snakes but on the third level and	is chiefly concerned with the anaconda.	6.696269159364874
8011. he reasons that as anacondas	30 feet long are often found some might be 38 and occasional monstrous	freaks over 50.	4.062570897459965
8012. he rejects dimensions of 70 feet and more.	7.08339902922487
8013. his thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents	with prodigious strength but these seem to be given to complete his	picture not to be believed.	4.729236476102189
8014. detailed information on record	lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows.	6.216816962892334
8015. of the six giants	discussions of the giants one by one will include	as far as possible data on these aspects of growth: size at which	life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached; time required	to reach maturity; rate of growth both before and after this crucial	stage; and maximum length with confirmation or amplification	of oliver's figures.	3.5315620348187196
8016. definite information on the growth of senile	individuals is lacking.	7.368640540112057
8017. at birth this species varies	considerably in size.	6.253555021987419
8018. a brood of twenty-eight born at brookfield	zoo near chicago ranged in length from 22 to 33-12 inches and averaged	29 inches.	5.130892137311206
8019. lawrence e griffin gives measurements of nineteen	young anacondas presumably members of a brood from south america;	the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit	of the brookfield brood and its average.	3.6799954472096905
8020. raymond l ditmars	had	two broods that averaged 27 inches.	6.871310905805299
8021. r r mole and f w	urich give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a brood	of thirty from the region of the orinoco estuaries.	3.786293054710708
8022. william beebe	reports 26 inches and 2.	8.797427849966851
8023. 4 ounces	for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from british guiana.	5.136365463356661
8024. in contrast ditmars recorded the average length of seventy-two	young of a 19-foot female as 38 inches and four young were born in london	at a length of 35 or 36 inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounces.	4.8606829902517426
8025. beebe had a 3-foot anaconda that weighed only 9.	4.888267284578986
8026. a difference	between subspecies might explain the great range in size.	6.2272542153453445
8027. i have little information on the anaconda's rate of growth.	5.554654442659949
8028. hans	schweizer had one that increased from 19-12 inches to 5 feet 3 inches	in five years and j j quelch records a growth of from less	than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years.	4.77269164379042
8029. it is very unlikely that	either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate.	4.778971191982454
8030. in 1948	afranio do amaral the noted brazilian herpetologist wrote a	technical paper on the giant snakes.	5.749063957568586
8031. he concluded that the anaconda's	maximum length is 12 or 13 meters which would approximate	from 39 to 42 feet.	4.0259827113566224
8032. thus	his estimate lies between oliver's suggestion of at least 37 feet	and the 50-foot monstrous freaks intimated by heuvelmans.	5.68406502361092
8033. the most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in	eastern colombia by roberto lamon a petroleum geologist of the richmond	oil company and reported in 1944 by emmett r dunn.	3.6015486617497627
8034. however	as a field measurement it is open to question.	6.7967143480171766
8035. oliver's 37-12	feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable.	4.616902939296685
8036. however many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer	a tentative maximum of about 30 feet.	6.156708853337442
8037. it is possible that especially	large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to	a small area.	4.9933461900187215
8038. in snakes difference in size is a common characteristic	of subspecies.	6.810760190647317
8039. a colombian female's brood	of sixteen boa constrictors born in the staten island zoo averaged	20 inches.	4.510907327550696
8040. this birth length seems to be typical.	9.105883425071719
8041. when some thirteen	records of newly and recently born individuals are collated little	or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected.	4.028949025177298
8042. the	range is from 14 to 25 inches; the former figure is based on a somewhat	unusual birth of four by a central american female	the latter on a normal	newly born individual.	5.242432822159938
8043. however as so many of the records are	not certainly based on newborn snakes these data must be taken tentatively;	final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods	from definite localities.	4.794900131007287
8044. alphonse r hoge's measurements	of several very young specimens from brazil suggest that at birth the	female is slightly larger than the male.	5.189188081913731
8045. i have surprisingly little	information on the size and age at maturity.	5.78378802300703
8046. carl kauffeld has	written to me of sexual activity in february 1943 of young born in march	1940.	5.454336586728915
8047. one female collected on an island off the coast of nicaragua	was gravid and measured 4 feet 8 inches from snout to vent	.	3.9636849426372627
8048. the female from central	america which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long.	5.2160527574722
8049. what data there are on growth indicate considerable variation	in rate; unfortunately no one has kept complete records of one individual	whereas many have been made for a very short period of time.	3.973060173778179
8050. the results are too varied to allow generalization.	6.269735228050855
8051. the bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close	relationship throughout.	3.93777821379478
8052. the pulmonary vein however without the limiting	supportive tissue septa as in type 1 follows a more direct	path	to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship	.	4.899826976576284
8053. another marked difference is noted here.	6.2808977011565155
8054. the pulmonary artery	in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole	the alveolar duct and the alveoli continues on and directly supplies	the thin pleura.	5.048884329962631
8055. the bronchial artery except for a	small number of short branches in the hilum contributes none of the	pleural blood supply.	3.6398110151839265
8056. it does as in type 1 supply the hilar lymph	nodes the pulmonary artery the pulmonary vein the bronchi and the	bronchioles- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary	artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole.	5.423929410220658
8057. no bronchial artery-pulmonary	artery anastomoses were noted in this group.	5.398430130358392
8058. lung	type 3 is to some degree a composite of types 1	and 2.	6.426288423503717
8059. it is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed	secondary lobules; well defined but haphazardly arranged interlobular	septa and a thick remarkably vascular pleura.	4.233044353903801
8060. the	most distal airways are similar to those found in type 1 being	composed of numerous apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional	poorly developed respiratory bronchioles.	5.12581433512635
8061. in this	instance because of incomplete septation the secondary lobule does	not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung	as in type 1.	4.578495628228417
8062. air-drifts from one area to another are therefore	conceivable.	6.806723317680827
8063. distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery	on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other as in type 1	.	4.27392098830005
8064. this relationship however is not maintained centrally.	7.7829086337725455
8065. here the pulmonary vein as in type 2 is noted to draw away from	the bronchus and to follow a more direct independent course to the	hilum.	4.027823189779386
8066. the bronchial artery in its course and distribution	differs somewhat from that found in other mammals.	5.124518734431128
8067. as seen in	types 1 and 2 it supplies the hilar lymph nodes vasa vasorum	to the pulmonary artery and vein the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles.	3.838030088052129
8068. as in type 1 it provides arterial blood to the interlobular	septa and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen	.	5.883076846300642
8069. this pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular	bronchial artery branches.	4.508640324326541
8070. such a dual derivation was strikingly	demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling	would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once.	5.398170341682986
8071. some	of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the	bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches	following along the pleural surface.	3.8225928423997066
8072. with completion of filling net-like	anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately	derived branches.	6.332724300488806
8073. an unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries	present within the substance of the lung was noted.	5.311977189252624
8074. this was accounted	for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following	the pulmonary artery.	6.969257908783622
8075. the diameter of this bronchial artery was	much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum.	4.643607578048647
8076. in distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that	of the pulmonary artery.	5.873314012191854
8077. this vessel could be followed to the parenchyma	where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar	capillary bed.	4.170680475539628
8078. also three other direct pathways	of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted: via the pleura;	through the interlobular septa; and along the terminal bronchiole	.	5.549313822137067
8079. one bronchial arteriolar-pulmonary arteriolar	anastomosis was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level.	4.968782988500926
8080. it is evident that many marked and striking differences	exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made.	5.896889278803231
8081. the	significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence	of corresponding physiologic differences been determined.	4.444943206438216
8082. however	the dynamics of airflow from morphologic considerations alone	may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse.	5.950264281099699
8083. the volume	and perhaps even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood	flow might be different in the dog than in the horse.	4.058346358229448
8084. also interlobular	air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow; probably occur	in the horse much as in the human being; and in contrast are present	to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where	lobules are absent.	5.096549414749884
8085. a reason	for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking	at present.	4.2705665792608904
8086. within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function	and if one is permitted to speculate potential pathology should	be included in this statement as well.	5.733961775657424
8087. for example the marked susceptibility	of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its	delicate long alveolar ducts and short large bronchioles situated	within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue	barriers such as those found in types 1 and 3.	3.7286306995461422
8088. one might also	wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know	it in man or the horse.	6.201200584111125
8089. in addition it would be difficult to imagine	chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow considering its marked	lobular development but conversely not difficult to imagine this	occurring in the horse or the dog.	4.360914975849539
8090. anatomically the horse lung	appears to be remarkably like that of man insofar as this can be ascertained	from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of	others in the human being.	5.273022128427911
8091. the only area in which	one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar	distribution of the bronchial arteries.	4.800328869712734
8092. as early as 1858 le	fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries in human	beings.	6.710349824574992
8093. in 1951 this was reaffirmed by cudkowicz.	5.783339828072867
8094. the opposition	to this point of view has its staunchest support in the work of miller	.	7.027480915468255
8095. apparently however miller has relied heavily on the	anatomy in dogs and cats and he has been criticized for using pathologic	human material in his normal study.	4.248202766621436
8096. although miller	noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed	between animals nowhere in his published works is it found that he	did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian	lungs other than in the dog and cat.	5.456767455024118
8097. the meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial	artery as found in the horse is not clear.	5.017661657255528
8098. however this artery is known	to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal	airways and supportive tissues of the lung.	5.6533866000352075
8099. the alveoli and respiratory	bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues.	4.465110340486763
8100. theoretically they	are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding	air or from pulmonary arterial	blood.	5.454336586728915
8101. therefore an explanation of this alveolar	bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased	amount of supportive tissue not primarily diffusing in nature	in the region of the alveolus.	3.862964342966114
8102. if this be true the possibility exists	that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread	degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized	emphysema.	5.419913629665037
8103. one would not expect such an event to occur in animals	possessing lungs of types 1 or 2.	4.2644076163558715
8104. the presence of normally	occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses was first	noted in 1721 by ruysch and thereafter by many others.	5.26917449293315
8105. nakamura	verloop von	hayek have all claimed their normal but	relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being.	4.479108556611168
8106. miller	is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint.	7.1581511048922275
8107. in criticism of the latter's	views his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies	in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution	under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored	particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level.	3.6717662387906236
8108. as early as 1913	ghoreyeb and karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs	that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level	when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein but that	increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative	drop in pulmonary artery pressure.	4.86514629517822
8109. berry brailsford and daly	in 1931 and nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this.	4.535752126583474
8110. our own studies in which	bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated	were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure	on the pulmonary artery or vein and then by injecting the pulmonary	artery and vein afterwards.	4.847815278206955
8111. it is distinctly possible therefore	that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered	the shunts inoperable and hence uninjectable.	4.092657374942762
8112. this viewpoint is further	supported by verloop's demonstration of thickened bronchial	artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting	as valves.	5.379282932642032
8113. in other words the anastomoses between the bronchial artery	and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand	shunts.	4.593433665880127
8114. in addition little work has been done on a comparative	basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary	artery anastomoses.	7.031900616966709
8115. verloop found these shunts	in the human being but was unable to find them in rats.	4.548690463699263
8116. ellis grindlay	and edwards also were unable to find them in rats.	6.093123995732186
8117. nakamura	was unable to demonstrate their existence either by anatomic	or physiologic methods in dogs.	4.343393044170812
8118. the possibility that the absence	or presence of these shunts is species-dependent is therefore inferred.	5.716552357398849
8119. certainly the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one	or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that	species.	4.041277629021142
8120. it is however highly suggestive and agrees well with our own	findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring	bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunts in certain species especially	the dog.	5.2913324568812445
8121. in conclusion these findings suggest the need for	a comparative physiology pathology and histology of mammalian lungs.	4.198063122201366
8122. in addition a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized	pulmonary emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent.	6.016103925737747
8123. also for the present great caution should be exercised in the	choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to	be applied to man.	4.313411657883509
8124. this is especially so if the dog cat or monkey are	to be used in view of their marked anatomical differences from man.	6.597775340686662
8125. finally it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be	anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently	known species.	5.3195380470131415
8126. the main subgross anatomical features	of the lungs of various mammals are presented.	5.812800448054867
8127. a tabulation of these	features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross	types.	4.1807151652587695
8128. type 1 is represented by the cow sheep and pig;	type 2 by the dog cat and monkey; type 3 by the horse.	5.3564833323418855
8129. lobularity is extremely well developed in type 1; absent in type	2; imperfectly developed in type 3.	4.060235568763422
8130. the pleura and interlobular	septa are thick in types 1 and 3.	5.506908456901043
8131. the pleura is extremely	thin in type 2 and septa are absent.	4.099370333146802
8132. arterial supply to the pleura	in types 1 and 3 is provided by the bronchial artery and	in type 2 by the pulmonary artery.	5.162566083429658
8133. in types 1 2 and 3	the bronchial artery terminates in a capillary bed shared in common	with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole.	4.080922224003057
8134. in	type 3 the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the	alveolar capillary bed.	5.7836982265615156
8135. true terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent	form taken by the distal airways in types 1 and 3 although	small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present.	3.903053570380299
8136. well developed respiratory bronchioles on the other hand appear	to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type 2.	6.57900651875463
8137. in	type 1 the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus	and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum.	4.336984396955402
8138. this maybe	due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present.	6.6594593691211506
8139. in	type 3 this general relationship is maintained peripherally but	not centrally where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path	to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type 2.	3.6395690672968875
8140. some of the features of the top portions of figure 1 and figure	2 were mentioned in discussing table 1.	6.7206543598807835
8141. first the onset profile	spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls.	4.751429395043408
8142. in contrast 20 of the 21 lines in the completion profile	are bunched and extend over a	much shorter period approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for	girls.	5.012747054373685
8143. the maturity chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that	onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas completion	is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence.	3.496190402669647
8144. second for	both sexes the 21 transverse lines in the onset profile vary more	in individual spread than those in the completion profile.	5.739114395429178
8145. although	the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines are based	are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early	there are considerable differences in this value between	centers having the closely timed onsets.	3.747718989248961
8146. third the process of calcification	is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these	boys than for the girls a fact which confirms data for other groups of	children.	5.611673018686978
8147. the onset profile and completion profile are constructed	to serve as norms for children.	3.93777821379478
8148. it is convenient to classify	a child's onset ages and completion ages as advanced moderate	or delayed according to whether the child's	age equivalent dots appeared to the left of upon or	to the right of the appropriate short transverse line.	5.260322401208518
8149. when a dot	appears close to the end of the transverse line the moderate	rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot	with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age.	4.931255777386706
8150. such classifications	may be called somewhat advanced or somewhat delayed	as the case may be reserving moderate for dots upon or close	to the mean.	5.5301990775752365
8151. in the lower portion of each chart the skeletal	age of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified.	4.2619839153054295
8152. there the middle one of the three curves denotes mean skeletal age	for the maturity series boys and girls.	7.3283824067448355
8153. the upper curve denotes	the mean plus one standard deviation and the lower curve represents	the mean minus one standard deviation.	3.7098848353901546
8154. thus a child's skeletal	age dots may be classified as advanced when they appear above	the middle curve moderate when they appear immediately above	or below the middle curve and delayed when they appear below	the lower curve.	5.009104245133069
8155. to summarize the purpose of the skeletal maturity	chart: each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which	show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level	of growth centers.	4.063800213092056
8156. first the upper portion requires series of films	for every child consisting of those from hand elbow shoulder knee	and foot.	5.81287429621968
8157. the lower portion necessitates only films of hand.	4.638798138420154
8158. second the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an	equal number of growth centers from the long short and round bones	of the five regions.	5.218469079373505
8159. the lower portion permits comparison of maturity	levels of short and round bones predominantly since only two long bones	are included in hand and wrist as a region.	3.563540707545236
8160. third the upper portion	deals with only two indicators of developmental level onset and	completion.	6.332272047539903
8161. the lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate	maturity indicators of each hand center as well as their onset	and completion.	4.205002805774687
8162. fourth the two indicators are for the most part	widely separated chronologically with the extensive age gap occurring	during childhood for all but one growth center.	5.372523855724029
8163. the lower portion provides	a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood.	4.129223139860112
8164. onsets	completions and skeletal ages of boy 34 and girl 2	may be directly compared and classified using only those skeletal ages	which appear immediately below the onset profile and the completion	profile.	4.785185163797336
8165. it may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection	of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small	according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for	centers throughout the body.	3.9516263249448436
8166. accordingly maturity level ratings by	means of the upper portion and lower portion of the chart respectively	should be somewhat similar since skeletal age assessments are dependent	upon onsets during infancy and upon completions during adolescence.	5.301632453772893
8167. it is clear that there are some differences in the ratings but	there is substantial agreement.	5.830308148027501
8168. since a skeletal age rating can	be made at any age during growth from elbow shoulder knee or foot	as well as hand it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes	to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood.	5.469973006108593
8169. as stated earlier in the paper onsets and completions-	particularly the former- provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy	in osseous development each within a limited age period.	3.8246625472664957
8170. such	an indicator or indicators are needed as means of recognizing specific	periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress.	5.368720319504203
8171. it	was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis	of variability of onset and completion in each of the 21 growth	centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in tables 1 and	2.	3.9107851364682946
8172. as one approach to doing this figures 3 and 4 have been constructed	from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for	boy 34 and girl 2.	5.099270129983066
8173. the differences between onset age and completion age	with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition	by means of a series of arrows.	3.84183726326958
8174. the data for boy 34 appear	in figure 3 and for girl 2 in figure 4.	5.124468832995878
8175. the numbering system used	in tables 1 and 2 and figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth	centers.	3.6398110151839265
8176. the dot on one end of each arrow indicates	extent of difference in months between the child's onset age and the	corresponding mean age for the growth center.	4.875246385008431
8177. the tip of the	arrow represents extent of difference between the child's completion	age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center.	3.932392994678624
8178. thus the	alignment of the dots and tips respectively indicate individual	variability of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect	to the mean values for these boys and girls.	5.106931317408671
8179. the direction in which	the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was	changed at completion from the level at onset.	3.721145399537687
8180. when the dot	and tip coincide the classification used in this paper is same	schedule.	6.515032901707807
8181. the length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or	acceleration at completion over that at onset and the difference	in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale	along the base of each figure or more precisely by referring to the	original data in the appropriate tables.	3.4865187914599263
8182. the difference between	the sequence of onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering	sequence in figures 3 and 4.	5.134628608309722
8183. this difference is readily clarified	by referring to table 1.	5.114100767216323
8184. for example arrow 17 in figure 3 portrays	the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34 whereas the same epiphysis	for girl 2 is portrayed by arrow 18 in figure 4.	5.197462691738133
8185. for the boy	this epiphysis was markedly delayed at onset but near the mean at completion.	4.666833584152916
8186. thus the span of its ossification was shortened and the center's	ability to catch up in ossification is demonstrated.	5.90608818218209
8187. in	contrast for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at onset	and delayed at completion.	4.21292691591616
8188. obviously the slowing for her may have	occurred at any point between onset and completion.	6.224060048845365
8189. the skeletal	age curve in the lower portion of figure 2 shows that slowing may have	occurred for her during the prepubescent period.	3.715806407134142
8190. length of the shaft	of these arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation	values for each center in table 1.	6.202267965431782
8191. we have attempted to simplify	the extensive task of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of	each child- more than 1700 values for the entire group- by constructing	figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34	boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center.	3.81292743808928
8192. figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of analyzing the results for	each growth center.	5.597211921163548
8193. forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the	original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this	monograph have been included in the appendix.	4.18595084726166
8194. the principles	used in making each arrow for figures 3 and 4 were applied to the	construction of figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the appendix.	5.198993279567991
8195. one growth center in a short bone- distal phalanx of the second	finger- was chosen as an example for discussion here primarily because	epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion the maturity indicator for completion	in long and short bones occurs in this center for girls near the	menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage.	3.5697789874782706
8196. its completion	thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include	in studies of growth dietary patterns and health during adolescence.	6.14600209262349
8197. the following summary based on figures 5 and 6 is an	example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset	ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the	appropriate mean age for each growth center.	3.5340487835317806
8198. at the top of figure 5	for example the onset range and completion range lines for the chosen	growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and	standard deviation values in table 1.	5.475841574735472
8199. the 34 arrows denoting onset	age plus completion age deviations have been arrayed in an onset	sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest onset of the	34 girls.	3.418595292505811
8200. the growth center depicted here in the distal phalanx of the	second finger is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones.	5.388316990138559
8201. the mean onset age was 25.	4.863481152584087
8202. 3 months and the average	span of the osseous stage was 133 months.	6.596893346571805
8203. the correlation	between onset age and completion age was +.	4.320730508808147
8204. 50 and that between onset	age and span was -.	7.358900134399509
8205. with due consideration for the limits of precision	in assessing expected rate of change in ossification of girls age	2 years and the known variations in rate of ossification of these	children as described in our preceding paper in the supplement each	arrow with a shaft length of four months or less was selected as	indicating same schedule at onset and completion for this particular	epiphysis.	3.39319292905582
8206. accordingly girls 31 29 33 21 26 13 3 4	14 32 24 25 34 23 6 15 22 and 16 may be said to have the same	schedule at onset and completion.	5.691349396803217
8207. it seems clear from	the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in figure 5 that	there was about an equal number of early and late onsets and completions	for the 34 girls.	4.268439397066852
8208. accordingly if epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion	occurs in this phalanx near menarche early and late menarches might	have been forecast rather precisely at the time of onset of ossification	for the 18 girls with same schedule.	5.341784969707484
8209. as an example of the interpretation	of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft	length in conjunction with its position in the figure: girl 2 had	a delayed onset and further delayed completion.	4.373361278284804
8210. it is of interest	that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls	in this group.	6.53542599564004
8211. a similar analysis of figure 6 for the 34 boys	would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value	of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage.	3.648651768242124
8212. boys 32 23 31 17 30 19 and 24 had same schedule at onset	and completion; thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage	would appear possible for only seven boys.	4.965209529498738
8213. boy 34 like girl 2 did not	have same schedule; his arrow crosses the line denoting the	mean.	4.060235568763422
8214. the dot on his arrow indicates early onset and the tip	indicates relatively later completion.	5.201929906662087
8215. after the 42 figures	had been drawn like figures 5 and 6 classifications of the onset	ages and completion ages were summarized from them.	4.115145666435148
8216. interestingly enough the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited	by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and	b.	5.801012276309364
8217. organification	the precise mechanism for organification of iodine	in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood.	4.5706784434185925
8218. however the formation	of organically bound iodine mainly mono-iodotyrosine can be	accomplished in cell-free systems.	6.680084120695932
8219. in the absence of additions to the	homogenate the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein	and kirkwood 1953; taurog potter and chaikoff 1955;	taurog potter tong and chaikoff 1956; serif and kirkwood	.	3.8736758075976625
8220. this iodoprotein does not	appear	to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid and there	is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro	by cell-free systems.	5.499450122426613
8221. in addition the iodoamino acid formed in largest	quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine.	4.899313385068642
8222. if tyrosine	and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate	of the thyroid large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can	be formed.	5.3507628114783214
8223. it is not clear whether this system	bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism and a system	generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue.	4.493181738950445
8224. on chemical	grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to	f and then to f as the active iodinating species.	5.733298783197748
8225. in the thyroid	gland it appears that proteins are iodinated	and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated.	4.263048142963745
8226. iodination of	tyrosine however is not enough for the synthesis of hormone.	7.198989861131925
8227. the mono-	and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and	thyroxine.	4.200697917275358
8228. the mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail	with non-enzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain	di-iodotyrosine analogues.	4.9757508263879044
8229. there	is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is	under enzymatic control.	4.578755707379631
8230. the chemical nature of the iodocompounds	is discussed below.	7.241065261249337
8231. little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of	thyroglobulin.	4.959317770675048
8232. its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems	nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in	vitro been unequivocally proven.	5.66731071490181
8233. there is some reason to think that thyroglobulin	synthesis may proceed independently of iodination for in	certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially	no iodinated thyroglobulin a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin	has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments	.	4.1421857582480355
8234. similar findings have been noted in a patient with	congenital absence of the organification enzymes whose thyroid tissue	could only concentrate iodide.	5.5730014248072015
8235. in addition depending on availability	of dietary iodine thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of	iodine.	4.944203324355901
8236. since the circulating thyroid hormones are	the amino acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine	it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their	release from proteins before secretion.	5.399104436391561
8237. the presence of several proteases	and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid.	4.4679511038027435
8238. one of	the proteases has ph optimum of about 3.	7.849721082160569
8239. 7 and another of about 5.	6.0988709231978
8240. the finding that the concentration of one of these proteases	is increased in thyroid glands from tsh-treated animals suggests	that this protease may be active in vivo.	5.609160599258905
8241. there is no conclusive	evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly	purified form nor is their specificity known.	4.312744482492503
8242. a study of their activity	on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released	and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation	of macromolecular intermediates.	5.1842193244099875
8243. besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes.	5.65598634557722
8244. a microsomal de-iodinase with a ph optimum of around 8 and requiring	reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity has been	identified in the thyroid.	5.075549610928492
8245. this de-iodinating enzyme	is effective against mono- and di-iodotyrosine but does not de-iodinate	thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine.	4.4302420610554645
8246. it is assumed that the iodine released	from the iodotyrosines remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid	where it is oxidised and re-incorporated into thyroglobulin.	5.173833500533577
8247. the thyroxine	and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping	de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream.	3.9101694773051827
8248. it has been	shown that thyroglobulin binds thyroxine but the binding does not appear	to be particularly strong.	6.219064013260369
8249. it has been suggested that the plasma	thyroxine-binding proteins which have an extremely high affinity for	thyroxine compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine	.	4.813524538168834
8250. antithyroid drugs are of two	general types.	7.603896187885215
8251. one type has a small univalent anion of the	thiocyanate-perchlorate-fluoroboride	type.	5.393655842266432
8252. this ion inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis	by interfering with iodide concentration in the thyroid.	5.902992870979968
8253. it does	not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such.	5.4344581981622975
8254. the other	group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil.	5.506908456901043
8255. these	drugs have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism but they	inhibit organification.	4.745046394980813
8256. the mechanism of action of these drugs has not	been completely worked out but certain of them appear to act by reducing	the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin	.	4.549302574745209
8257. on the other hand there are a few antithyroid drugs	of this same general type such as resorcinol possessing no reducing	activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular	iodine.	4.469385124840239
8258. any of the antithyroid drugs of either type if given	in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre owing	to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis with production of hypothyroidism.	5.926330946693845
8259. the anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased	output of tsh causing the thyroid to enlarge.	3.676867685470798
8260. the effect	of drugs that act on the iodide-concentrating mechanism can be counteracted	by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet.	4.85382417020242
8261. the antithyroid drugs of the thiouracil type however are not antagonised	by such means.	3.93777821379478
8262. besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol	types certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring	foods.	7.138531689784262
8263. the most conclusively identified is l-5-vinyl-2-thio-oxazolidone	which was isolated from rutabaga.	4.87808895356117
8264. it is presumed	to occur in other members of the brassica family.	8.026374665675387
8265. there is some	evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development	of goitre particularly in tasmania and australia	.	4.798159584616605
8266. there it seems that the goitrogen ingested by	dairy	animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active	goitrogen which is then secreted in the milk.	5.499326090851605
8267. besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet the level of	iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity	of the thyroid gland.	4.1507405265260955
8268. in the experimental animal and in man gross	deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia hypertrophy and	increased thyroid activity	.	5.5767915675413535
8269. in man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary	to prevent development of goitre is about 100 |mg per day.	3.781391090931543
8270. with	lower levels thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood-flow	enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake	of iodine.	5.287113923804318
8271. further the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction	of the thyroid hormone de-iodinated peripherally.	5.021962504055717
8272. in the presence of	a low iodine intake thyroglobulin labelled in vivo with f is found	to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal the amounts of di-iodotyrosine	and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced.	5.148654890917254
8273. this appears	to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more	rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin.	3.9930958898744646
8274. if the deficiency	persists long enough it is reasonable to suppose that the f label	will reflect the f distribution in the thyroglobulin.	6.087738968270601
8275. similar results	might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions	that limit iodide trapping or organification or accelerate thyroglobulin	proteolysis.	4.242441179728759
8276. the	name thyroid-stimulating hormone has been given to a substance	found in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so	far	tested for its presence.	5.211554892213611
8277. the hormone has also been called thyrotrophin	or thyrotrophic hormone.	4.448767001522802
8278. at the present time we do not know by what	biochemical mechanism tsh acts on the thyroid but for bio-assay	of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity	may be estimated including release of iodine from the thyroid increase	in thyroid weight increase in mean height of the follicular cells	and increase in the thyroidal uptake of f.	5.317669899007057
8279. here we shall restrict	discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise	for determining the concentration of tsh in blood.	4.2424682984083235
8280. brown	has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying tsh	and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on	the subject.	5.216505686369262
8281. tsh	as long ago as 1851 it was pointed out by niepce	that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid.	4.2891925776588735
8282. this connection was clarified by smith and smith who showed	that saline extracts of fresh bovine pituitary glands could re-activate	the atrophied thyroids of hypophysectomised tadpoles.	5.022076087277668
8283. the first attempts	to isolate tsh came a decade later when janssen and loeser	used trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble tsh	from insoluble impurities.	3.8708067597668383
8284. after their work other investigators applied	salt-fractionation techniques to the problem as well as fractionation	with organic solvents such as acetone.	6.768559246692567
8285. albert has concluded	that the most active preparations of tsh made during this period	from 1931 to 1945 were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent	as the starting material.	3.602552419698558
8286. much of this work has been reviewed by	white.	9.311394049680187
8287. developments up to about 1957 have	been discussed by sonenberg.	5.127573824759733
8288. in the last few years	the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the	problem of isolating tsh has led to further purification	.	6.269178917327523
8289. the most	active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators	appear to be similar in potency composition and physical properties.	3.6398110151839265
8290. two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in	blood.	7.31704589425193
8291. first is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that	found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored?	4.779546457858139
8292.  second what	is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances	will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction?	5.681940952138211
8293. 	it is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary	tsh if the fragmentary chemical information about blood	tsh is to be discussed rationally.	4.199510035050647
8294. the importance of knowing in	what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent	observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting tsh in	blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients.	4.838273046914822
8295. whether this	abnormal tsh differs chemically from pituitary tsh or	is alternatively normal tsh with its period of effectiveness	modified	by some other blood constituent cannot be decided without chemical	study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison	of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary	tsh.	3.639382535351704
8296. in evaluating data on the concentration of tsh	in blood one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used	to obtain them.	5.761822353065682
8297. the introduction of the united states pharmacopoeia	reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the	usp and international units of thyroid-stimulating activity have	made it possible to compare results published by different investigators	since that time.	3.7324549561098905
8298. we should like to re-emphasise the importance of	stating results solely in terms of international units of tsh activity	and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units.	5.910556959488304
8299. for	the most part this discussion will be confined to results obtained since	a.	4.447943492246375
8300. standard preparations	the international	unit	adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different	laboratories has been defined as the	amount of activity present in 13.	5.1642753035472735
8301. 5 mg of the international standard	preparation.	7.772019286463683
8302. the international unit is equipotent with the usp	unit adopted in 1952 which was defined as the amount of activity	present in 20 mg of the usp reference substance.	5.034116947674421
8303. muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though	serious complication of steroid therapy with most of the synthetic	adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use.	4.253637547457992
8304. although biopsies have	shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced	weakness this case provides the only example known to us in which	necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle	groups.	5.375139635505346
8305. the case described in this paper is that of an older man	who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of	steroids for a refractory anemia.	3.8943112249405587
8306. this patient	was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the new york hospital	for his fourth and terminal admission on june 26 1959 because	of disabling weakness and general debility.	5.233498092157554
8307. in 1953 the patient	developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood transfusions were	given over a period of 4 years.	4.302856691578157

8399. microscopic studies of the gastrocnemius	pectoralis major transversus abdominis biceps brachii and diaphragm	showed atrophy as well as varying degrees of injury ranging from	swelling and vacuolization to focal necrosis of the muscle fibers.	3.8186259217076812
8400. these changes were most marked in the gastrocnemius and biceps and less	evident in the pectoralis diaphragm and transversus.	5.495416057198902
8401. in	the	gastrocnemius and biceps there were many swollen and homogeneous necrotic	fibers such as that shown in figure 2.	4.215170399587305
8402. such swollen fibers were	deeply eosinophilic contained a few pyknotic nuclei and showed loss	of cross-striations obliteration of myofibrils and prominent vacuolization.	5.532740369355324
8403. the necrosis often involved only a portion of the length of	a given fiber and usually the immediately adjacent fibers were normal.	4.004438983087726
8404. as shown in figure 3 the protoplasm of other fibers was pale granular	or flocculated and invaded by phagocytes.	6.108186400805377
8405. inflammatory cells	were strikingly absent.	6.683325264329536

8415. in all of the sections	examined the arterioles and small arteries were essentially normal.	6.090524341991655
8416. in attempting to improve specificity	of staining the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct	and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways: they	were passed through dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone	insoluble powders prepared from mouse liver or from healthy	sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by agrobacterium	tumefaciens conn on sweet clover	stems.	4.704781304440133
8417. the conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed	for 30 minutes with 20-50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet	clover stems.	4.130490016819865
8418. the proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of f in	f to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80% saturation	with f.	4.953726606606469
8419. the precipitate was washed twice with an 80% saturated	solution of f dissolved in a small quantity of 0.	3.760119418903095
8420. 1 m neutral	phosphate buffer dialyzed against cold distilled water till free	from ammonium ions and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen.	5.782682650808397
8421. in other	experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of	ethyl acetate as recommended by dineen and ade the conjugates	were passed through a diethylaminoethyl cellulose	column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer containing	f potassium phosphate and f.	3.5130859102369327
8422. the technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that	described by coons et al.	5.95822304016549
8423. root and stem tumors from	sweet clover plants infected with wtv were quick-frozen in liquid	nitrogen embedded in ice and cut at 3-6 |m in a cryostat maintained	at -16` to -20`.	3.562115886365008
8424. the sections were mounted on cold slides	smeared with haupts' adhesive in earlier experiments	and in later experiments with a different mixture of the same components	reported by schramm and ro^ttger.	5.044758946867299
8425. the latter adhesive	was found to be much more satisfactory.	5.139420874294031
8426. the sections were then	thawed by placing a finger under the slide and dried under a fan for	staining	technique the sections were fixed	in	acetone for 15 minutes and dried at 37` for 30 minutes.	4.574509500690233
8427. some of them	were then covered with a drop of f in a moist chamber at 24` for	30-40 minutes.	4.870434031031416
8428. as controls other sections were similarly covered with	ns.	7.622343996348411
8429. sections were then washed with pbs for 15-30 minutes.	4.855658467968249
8430. after blotting out most of the saline around the sections a drop	of f was layered over each of the sections allowed to react for 30	minutes and then washed with pbs for 15-30 minutes.	5.576716333459047
8431. after blotting	out most of the liquid around the sections the latter were mounted	in buffered glycerine.	5.198427521818405
8432. after drying the sections under the fan fixing	in acetone and drying at 37` as in the indirect method the sections	were treated with conjugated f or f	for 5-30 minutes.	5.42257276974908
8433. as controls other sections were similarly	treated with f or conjugated antiserum to the new york strain of	potato yellow-dwarf virus.	4.839220254821605
8434. the sections	were then washed with pbs for 15-30 minutes and mounted in buffered	glycerine.	5.289832921804139
8435. stained or unstained sections	were examined under dark field illumination in a zeiss fluorescence	microscope equipped with a mercury vapor lamp	.	4.098809338731373
8436. the light beam from the lamp was filtered through a half-standard	thickness corning 1840 filter.	5.201502443459278
8437. in the eyepiece a wratten 2 b	filter was used to filter off residual ultra-violet light.	4.523757687706695
8438. a red filter	zeiss barrier filter with the code designation bg	23 was also used in the ocular lens assembly as it improved the contrast	between specific and nonspecific fluorescence.	5.499255717194332
8439. _specificity	of staining in the first few experiments	f was passed through dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed	twice with 50-100 mg sweet clover tissue powder.	4.418387743395228
8440. the intermediate	sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder.	5.804273692121158
8441. sections of sweet	clover stem and root tumors were treated with 1:10 solution of f	for 30 minutes washed in buffered saline for 15 minutes stained with	f for 30 minutes and washed for 15 minutes in pbs.	3.4946482859569494
8442. such sections	showed bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cells	of the pseudophloem tissue.	6.5794045547172715
8443. this specific fluorescence	was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence	in consecutive sections stained with 1:10 dilution of ns	and f or with f alone.	3.8923049712672766
8444. unstained sections mounted in buffered	glycerine or sections treated only with ns or f did not show	such green fluorescence.	5.2920541105344485
8445. sections of crown gall tissue similarly stained	with either f and f or ns and f also showed only the light	green nonspecific fluorescence.	3.9110586525394067
8446. however the nonspecific staining	by the f in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused	with the staining of small amounts of wtv antigen.	5.525300555758576
8447. two absorptions of f with ethyl acetate or two absorptions of f	ns and f with	crown gall tissue powder or mouse liver powder did not further improve	the specificity of staining.	3.727043108093079
8448. treatment of all the sera with sweet	clover proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence especially when	the treated conjugate was diluted to 1:2 with 0.	5.625118601108648
8449. in	all the above procedures when the intermediate sera were diluted to	1:10 or 1:100 with 0.	4.1459194620973925
8450. 85% saline the specific and nonspecific fluorescence	were not appreciably reduced whereas a dilution of the intermediate	sera to 1:500 or diluting the f to 1:5 greatly reduced	specific fluorescence.	4.847755985425517
8451. rinsing the sections with pbs before	layering	the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction.	4.21292691591616
8452. in addition	to other treatments treating the sections with normal sheep serum	for half an hour before layering f did not reduce nonspecific staining.	5.700470445719997
8453. the only treatment by which nonspecific staining could	be satisfactorily	removed was by passing the conjugate through a deae-cellulose	column.	4.1360876991542534
8454. when 1 ml of conjugate was passed through a column	the first and second milliliter fractions collected were the	most	specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments and	very little in others.	4.967732666592859
8455. in the latter cases an additional treatment of	the deae-cellulose-treated f with 50 mg of sweet clover stem	tissue powder further improved the specificity.	4.1195693797390165
8456. after these treatments	the conjugate did not stain healthy or crown gall sweet clover tissues	or stained them a very faint green which was easily distinguishable	from the bright yellow-green specific staining.	5.011522319517554
8457. with this purified	conjugate the best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections	with 1:10 dilution of f for 30 minutes washing with pbs	for 15 minutes staining with f for 30 minutes and washing with	pbs for 15 minutes.	3.757692379179389
8458. the specificity of staining in wtv tumors	with f and f but not with ns and f or with antiserum to	potato yellow-dwarf virus and f and the absence of such staining	in crown gall tumor tissue from sweet-clover indicate that an antigen	of wtv was being stained.	4.625346049432937
8459. f was first conjugated	with 50 mg of fitc per gram of globulin.	4.605298022695356
8460. this conjugate	was passed twice through dowex-2-chloride and treated with various	tissue powders in the same manner as described for the indirect method.	5.979931994345962
8461. in all cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining was still	present although it was still distinguishable from specific fluorescence.	4.636877144188152
8462. in later experiments f and f were prepared by conjugating	8 mg of fitc per gram of globulin.	5.817949463096236
8463. these conjugates	f had much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate	while the specific staining	was similar in both cases.	4.1832396743862645
8464. nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily	eliminated by passing these conjugates through a deae-cellulose	column as described for f.	5.454336586728915
8465. the best staining procedure with	this purified f consisted of staining with the conjugate for 30	minutes and washing in pbs for 15 minutes.	3.798390272430877
8466. the specificity of	staining with f was established as follows: f specifically stained	tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or	of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover.	4.570140842607308
8467. sections of tumors incited	by wtv were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum	or conjugated antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus.	3.8880356915934375
8468. after	passing f through deae-cellulose the titer of antibodies to	wtv in the specific fraction was 1:4 of the titer before such	passage; but mere dilution	of the conjugate to 1:4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific	staining.	4.750410309994357
8469. this indicates that increase in specificity of f after	passing it through deae-cellulose was not merely due to dilution.	4.282387241655339
8470. specific staining by deae-cellulose treated f	and f although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either	nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells was not satisfactorily	photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts	with black and white and color photography.	5.131994692709386
8471. this was chiefly because	of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells.	5.200474133249768
8472. the autofluorescence	from the walls of the xylem cells was particularly brilliant.	5.6180183604852765
8473. results of specific staining by the	direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the localization	of wtv antigen in certain tissues of tumors.	3.725131536371901
8474. the virus antigen	was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue.	5.998227019452429
8475. frequently a few isolated	thick-walled cells or rarely groups of such cells in the xylem region	were also specifically stained but there was no such staining	in epidermis cortex most xylem cells ray cells or pith.	3.8815619047609298
8476. within	the pseudophloem cells the distribution of wtv antigen was	irregular in the cytoplasm.	5.926734816808145
8477. no antigen was detectable in certain dark	spherical areas in most cells.	4.972018682180319
8478. these areas are thought to represent	the	nuclei.	8.261597716243378
8479. in some tumor sections small spherical bodies possibly inclusion	bodies stained more intensely than	the rest of cytoplasm and probably contained more antigen.	4.142548868131276
8480. in all cases	studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not	contain detectable amounts of wtv antigen.	6.191878540103215
8481. in	both the direct and indirect methods of staining the conjugates had	nonspecifically staining fractions.	4.305414028832856
8482. in the indirect method this was	evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green	even when stained with ns and f or with f only.	5.592954248312164
8483. in the direct	method f not further treated stained certain tissues of healthy	sweet clover stems nonspecifically and wtv tumor sections were similarly	stained by comparable f.	3.8477537417957914
8484. after f and f were passed through	dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover	tissue powder nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing	amount of such staining was still present.	5.126715280861606
8485. treatment of the conjugates	with ethyl acetate and the conjugates	with mouse liver powder sweet clover crown	gall tissue powder or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily	remove nonspecifically staining substances in the conjugates.	3.7317597678592533
8486. such	treatments of the conjugates have usually been successful in eliminating	nonspecific staining in several other systems.	5.550554466109728
8487. schramm	and ro^ttger did not report any such nonspecific staining	of plant tissues with fluorescein isocyanate-labeled antiserum to tobacco	mosaic virus.	3.9394316778493597
8488. the reason for the failure of these treatments to	eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not	known.	5.782810265672489
8489. in our work the best procedure for removing substances	causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was	to pass the conjugates through a deae-cellulose	column and in some cases to absorb the first and second	milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder.	3.913587010104091
8490. the	specific	staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that wtv antigen	was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick-walled	cells in the xylem region but was not detectable in any other	tissues of the root and stem tumors.	5.005158002588528
8491. a study of the distribution of wtv	antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly	distributed in the cytoplasm.	4.9637290821025815
8492. wound-tumor virus is a leafhopper	transmitted virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation	.	5.926734816808145
8493. the concentration	and	apparent localization of the wtv antigen in pseudophloem tissue	of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiplies	in the phloem and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order	to infect plants.	3.5181013735470574
8494. since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on	individual experience and are aroused in man in addition by complex	symbols one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from	the cortex.	5.127253997674029
8495. in experiments with topical application of strychnine on	the cerebral cortex the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the	hypothalamus was demonstrated.	3.9020296841728688
8496. moreover the responsiveness of the	hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these	conditions.	6.48510023292904
8497. even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms	of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey a on seeing	monkey b in emotional stress.	4.278075067386682
8498. a previously	extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey a	and was associated	with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic	discharges.	5.258925197803143
8499. it seems to follow that by and large an antagonism	exists between the paleo- and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity	is concerned and that the balance between the two systems determines	the emotional responsiveness of the organism.	4.76245653278906
8500. in addition the	neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates as	mirsky's interesting experiment on the communication of affect	demonstrates.	5.889125548798454
8501. but even in relatively primitive laboratory animals	such as the rat sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus	and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex.	4.085356220045806
8502. maclean stressed	correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of	the individual and the species as evidenced by the influence of the	limbic brain on emotions related to fight	and flight and also on sexual functions.	5.157462699120497
8503. it should be added that in	man	neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion	of emotional processes with those underlying perception memory	imagination and creativity.	4.735893314085573
8504. previous experiences are obviously	of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional	response.	5.977280472119866
8505. the visceral brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute	to memory but this topic is beyond the scope of this	paper.	4.3641679199876915
8506. after	this brief discussion of neo- paleocortical and cortico-hypothalamic	relations let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance	and its physiological and pathological significance.	5.690825926952447
8507. facilitatory	processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending	and descending pathways.	4.535752126583474
8508. thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical	application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate	with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive	discharges.	5.514841514791466
8509. on the other hand the temporary reduction in hypothalamic	excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior	hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of	cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored.	3.9230522652773447
8510. apparently a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus	and the cerebral cortex.	6.426137665239366
8511. consequently if for any reason	the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level the	lessened hypothalamic-cortical discharges lead to a diminished state	of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal	discharges.	3.6110207650110904
8512. obviously a vicious cycle develops.	9.48847593294957
8513. this tendency can	be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or	via cortico-hypothalamic pathways.	4.473164702223352
8514. it is believed that drug therapy	and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism.	6.368795082194251
8515. before we comment further on these pathological conditions	we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within	physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness.	4.909496300681809
8516. thus	a low intensity of hypothalamic-cortical discharges prevails in sleep	and a high one during wakefulness resulting in synchronous eeg	potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition.	5.152757981461299
8517. moreover	the dominance in parasympathetic action	at the hypothalamic level induces by its peripheral	action the autonomic symptoms of sleep and by its action on the	cortex a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus	of the somatic nervous system.	3.439508000987916
8518. with the dominance of the sympathetic	division of the hypothalamus the opposite changes occur.	6.585094152016664
8519. since	electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects	of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces	sleep it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is	altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus.	4.352649091821039
8520. similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes	in man and animals.	6.016507148100051
8521. of particular importance is the study of	the actions of drugs in this respect.	4.964619777773032
8522. although no drugs act exclusively	on the hypothalamus or a part of it there is sufficient specificity	to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic	side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance.	5.660658122304141
8523. the	former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs the latter the tranquilizers.	4.681571082223364
8524. specific differences exist in the action of different drugs	belonging to the same group as for instance between reserpine and	chlorpromazine.	6.070679601328896
8525. important as these differences are they should not	obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently	to the parasympathetic side we produce depressions whereas	a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and eventually	maniclike changes.	3.6908244318982235
8526. the emotional states produced by drugs influence	the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner; synchrony	prevails in the eeg of the experimental animal after administration	of tranquilizers but asynchrony after application of analeptic and	psychoactive drugs.	4.546220371272326
8527. the shock therapies act likewise on the	hypothalamic balance.	4.465075916986007
8528. physiological experiments and clinical observations	have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled	hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges.	5.2920541105344485
8529. they shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side.	5.404475899071562
8530. this explains	the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions	and a shift in the reaction from hypo- to normal reactivity of the	sympathetic system as shown by the mecholyl test.	5.080054984114679
8531. some investigators	have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic	reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated	by the mecholyl test and conversely between clinical impairment and	increasing deviation of this test from the norm.	3.6811068292437894
8532. nevertheless the	theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has	a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients	has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients.	5.237815566651125
8533. the	mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are	reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance but for the sake	of correlating autonomic and clinical states and of studying the effect	of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions	additional tests seem to be desirable.	3.687250018495851
8534. it was assumed that the	shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in	neuropsychiatric	patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures	follows the pattern known from the sleep-wakefulness cycle.	5.352196915008661
8535. a change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal	individual to sleep or in special circumstances to cardiovascular	collapse or nausea and vomiting.	4.128852084161068
8536. in both conditions the emotional and	perceptual sensitivity is diminished but no depression occurs such	as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs.	5.17992496103097
8537. the	fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states	of parasympathetic dominance remain to be	elucidated.	4.411891185517149
8538. perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies	in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges	which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative	alterations in reactivity.	5.619298930488499
8539. a state of parasympathetic tuning	of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase	in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure to direct and	reflexly induced stimuli but leads also to an autonomic reversal:	a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in	this state of tuning a parasympathetic response! furthermore conditioned	reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic	reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level and several types	of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic	tuning are observed.	3.358938393458611
8540. if for instance such a change is	produced by one or a few insulin comas or electroshocks previously	inhibited conditioned reactions reappear.	5.492200299236217
8541. however if these procedures	are applied more often conditioned emotional responses are temporarily	abolished.	4.965158605006454
8542. in other studies loss of differentiation in previously	established conditioned reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive	treatments suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance	between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes.	5.263589074363882
8543. it has	further been shown that: an experimental neurosis in its initial	stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic	balance; drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned	reactions; in a state of depression the positive conditioned	stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned reaction but cause an increased	synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing	effect on the eeg.	3.7190094107420184
8544. these are few and seemingly disjointed data	but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations	in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic	balance has been altered by physiological experimentation	pharmacological action or clinical processes.	5.429432321903111
8545. basis of some form of psychotherapy	the foregoing remarks	imply	that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads	between physiological and pathological forms of emotion.	3.888795927176761
8546. if this is	the case one would expect that not only the various procedures just	mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional	state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise.	5.4228364045479704
8547. we	pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders	and neurotic symptoms particularly in certain types of personality	but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion	may cure a battle neurosis.	3.779550949343035
8548. this phenomenon raises the question	whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not	have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses.	5.826896165911303
8549. being	a strictly	physiological procedure one may expect from such a study additional	information on the nature of the emotional process itself.	4.503426141925652
8550. wolpe's experiments and therapeutic work lie in this area.	6.522871687113793
8551. he showed	convincingly that anxiety is a learned reaction and	is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed therefore	that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional	and reversible.	3.8718950552717915
8552. an important observation of pavlov served as a	guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means.	5.642796806206975
8553. in	a conditioning experiment he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding	and pain.	4.90652447747638
8554. a mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus	and was followed by feeding.	6.125352549970901
8555. the pain became thus the symbol for food	and elicited salivary secretion.	4.4522095096831
8556. even when the	intensity of the shocks was increased gradually it failed to evoke	any signs of pain.	6.206406319443832
8557. since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental	neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental	situation wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding-pain antagonism	to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding.	3.8819954968507884
8558. appropriate	experiments showed that this is indeed possible.	8.972501692321265
8559. he then applied	this	principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses.	5.560558657254296
8560. he took advantage	of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety	and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former	attitude was established.	5.3311053541188755
8561. for the interpretation of these significant	investigations it should be remembered that reciprocal relations	exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions	which are closely associated with the emotions.	4.650332624516336
8562. the feeding-pain	antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the	tropho- and ergotropic systems.	6.126252993465064
8563. furthermore a functional antagonism	exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety.	5.01565987590029
8564. although	in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present different autonomic-somatic	patterns underlie aggression and anxiety respectively	as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines the state	of the muscle tone and the mecholyl test.	5.114103742739756
8565. the psychological incompatibility	of these emotional states seems to be reflected in or based	on this marked difference.	4.411263430447413
8566. in	our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological	range we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity	of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system	and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems respectively.	5.136118886777302
8567. we stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with	respect to the autonomic-somatic downward discharge as well as regarding	the hypothalamic-cortical discharge.	4.551582909519694
8568. although we are still far from	a complete understanding of these problems as a first approximation	it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent	changes in the hypothalamic-cortical discharges account for	major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions	in man and beast under physiological circumstances in experimental and	clinical neurosis and as the result of psychopharmacological agents.	4.850344249043037
8569. in view of the important role which emotional disturbances play in	the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism	observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several	instances it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may	play an important role in initiating mental changes.	3.61559419679151
8570. we are trying to study a	linear operator t on the finite-dimensional space v	by decomposing t into a direct sum of operators which are in some	sense elementary.	5.620450547734126
8571. we can do this through the characteristic values	and vectors of t in certain special cases ie when the	minimal polynomial for t factors over the scalar field f	into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1.	3.7932243366723157
8572. what can	we do with the general t?	9.084027735128421
8573.  if we try to study t using	characteristic values we are confronted with two problems.	5.005365786781448
8574. first	t may not have a single characteristic value; this is really	a deficiency in the scalar field namely that it is not algebraically	closed.	6.884497102252879
8575. second even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely	over f into a product of polynomials of degree 1 there	may not be enough characteristic vectors for t to span the	space v; this is clearly a deficiency in t.	3.6521019095727394
8576. the second	situation is illustrated by the operator t on f	represented in the standard basis by f.	5.27730380477292
8577. the characteristic	polynomial for a is f and this is plainly also the minimal	polynomial for a.	4.260555949028639
8578. thus t is not	diagonalizable.	10.895892394319745
8579. one sees that this happens because the null space of	f has dimension 1 only.	4.545529936239373
8580. on the other hand the null space of f and	the null space of f together span v the former being the	subspace spanned by f and the latter the subspace spanned by f and	f.	5.471089306776263
8581. this will be more or less our general method for the second	problem.	6.003570186473579
8582. if the minimal polynomial	for t decomposes f where f are distinct elements of f	then we shall show that the space v is the direct sum	of the null spaces of f.	5.213369362195796
8583. the diagonalizable operator is the special	case of this in which f for each i.	3.9927087899798464
8584. the theorem which we prove	is more general than what we have described since it works with the	primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial whether or not the primes	which enter are all of first degree.	5.044183871221996
8585. the reader will find it helpful	to think of the special case when the primes are of degree 1 and	even more particularly to think of the proof of theorem 10 a special	case of this theorem.	3.8828219802501467
8586. let t be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional	vector space v over the field f.	6.191551553772595
8587. let p be the	minimal polynomial for t f where the f are distinct irreducible	monic polynomials over f and the f are positive integers.	4.022921787533274
8588. let f be the null space of f.	8.092599450403776
8589. then each f	is invariant under t if f is the operator induced on	f by t	then the minimal polynomial for f is f.	3.9332070915826924
8590. the idea of the proof is this.	9.076511585510284
8591. if the direct-sum decomposition	is valid how can we get hold of the projections f associated with	the decomposition?	4.579014573029399
8592.  the projection f will be the identity on f	and zero on the other f.	6.93193037973776
8593. we shall find a polynomial f such that	f is the identity on f and is zero on the other f and so that	f etc.	4.406258069583129
8594. for each i let f.	9.174212119023773
8595. since f are distinct	prime polynomials the polynomials f are relatively prime	.	5.0377646106564145
8596. thus there are polynomials f such that f.	8.133516827816345
8597. note	also that if f then f is divisible by the polynomial p	because f contains each f as a factor.	3.8880356915934375
8598. we shall show that the polynomials	f behave in the manner described in the first paragraph of	the proof.	7.144552601621948
8599. since f and p divides f for f	we have f.	5.238856538371681
8600. thus the f are projections which correspond to some	direct-sum decomposition of the space v.	6.61383931476735
8601. we wish to show that	the range of f is exactly the subspace f.	5.135347316068618
8602. it is clear that each	vector in the range of f is in f for if |a is in the range of	f then f and so f because f is divisible by the minimal polynomial	p.	5.536097501791552
8603. conversely suppose that |a is in the null space	of f.	5.592732920585567
8604. if f then f is divisible by f and so f ie	f.	6.50722323845773
8605. but then it is immediate that f ie that |a is in	the range of f.	5.1083226261616375
8606. this completes the proof of statement.	7.872441762333743
8607. it is certainly clear that the subspaces f are invariant under t.	5.272497640207474
8608. if f is the operator induced on f by t then evidently	f because by definition f is 0 on the subspace f.	5.3507628114783214
8609. this shows	that the minimal polynomial for f divides f.	4.987041256881453
8610. conversely let	g be any polynomial such that f.	6.806723317680827
8611. thus f is divisible	by the minimal polynomial p of t ie f	divides f.	4.716086338108351
8612. it is easily seen that f divides g.	7.5083719149560375
8613. hence the	minimal polynomial for f is f.	6.044453147245698
8614. if f are the	projections associated with the primary decomposition of t then	each f is a polynomial in t and accordingly if a linear	operator u commutes with t then u commutes with	each of the f ie each subspace f is invariant under u.	4.853768246714246
8615. in the notation of the proof of theorem 12 let us take a	look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for t	is a product of first-degree polynomials ie the case in	which	each f is of the form f.	3.7690728716542066
8616. now the range of f is the null space	f of f.	7.727704586965915
8617. by theorem 10 d is a diagonalizable	operator which we shall call the	of t.	4.646323944443011
8618. let us look at the operator f.	11.22012595982446
8619. now f f so f.	7.146806727942392
8620. the reader	should be familiar enough with projections by now so that he sees that	f and in general that f.	5.15468007054559
8621. when f for each i we shall have	f because the operator f will then be 0 on the range of f.	4.351240773923057
8622. let n be a linear operator on the vector	space v.	7.294517422696845
8623. we say that n is if there	is some positive integer r such that f.	4.655599545407681
8624. let	t be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector	space v over the field f.	5.659455227543579
8625. suppose that the minimal polynomial	for t decomposes over f into a product of linear	polynomials.	4.76947289989244
8626. then there is a diagonalizable operator d on	v and a nilpotent operator n on v such that	f f.	6.905866756297435
8627. the diagonalizable operator d and the nilpotent	operator n are uniquely determined by	and	each of them is a polynomial in t.	3.7969703552646967
8628. we have just observed	that we can write f where d is diagonalizable and n	is nilpotent and where d and n not only commute	but are polynomials in t.	5.364734510362238
8629. now suppose that we also have f	where d' is diagonalizable n' is nilpotent and	f.	4.696173831079148
8630. we shall prove that f.	10.32729317769218
8631. since d' and n'	commute with one another and f we see that d' and n'	commute with t.	4.558345996290158
8632. thus d' and n'	commute with any polynomial in t; hence they commute with d	and with n.	5.893506087683219
8633. now we have f or f and all four of these	operators commute with one another.	4.947233801288714
8634. since d and d'	are both diagonalizable and they commute they are simultaneously	diagonalizable and f is diagonalizable.	5.901105153168451
8635. since n and n'	are both nilpotent and they commute the operator f is nilpotent;	for using the fact that n and n' commute f	and so when r is sufficiently large every term in this expression	for f will be 0.	3.8065254923340412
8636. space must have its nth power 0; if we take f	above that will be large enough.	6.007885336146407
8637. it then follows that f is large	now f is	a diagonalizable operator which is also nilpotent.	4.744516779360126
8638. such an operator	is obviously the zero operator; for since it is nilpotent the minimal	polynomial for this operator is of the form f for some f; but	then since the operator is diagonalizable the minimal polynomial cannot	have a repeated root; hence f and the minimal polynomial is simply	x which says the operator is 0.	4.771902778661708
8639. thus we see that f and	f.	6.84892727951879
8640. let v be a finite-dimensional vector	space over an algebraically closed field f eg the field	of complex numbers.	5.926709046489434
8641. then every linear operator t on v	can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator d and	a nilpotent operator n which commute.	4.070489322817355
8642. these operators d	and n are unique and each is a polynomial in t.	6.273098352350443
8643. from these results one sees that the study of linear operators	on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced	to the study of nilpotent operators.	4.364612256910198
8644. for vector spaces over non-algebraically	closed fields we still need to find some substitute for	characteristic values and vectors.	5.640593272223933
8645. it is a very interesting fact that	these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we	shall do in the next chapter.	5.616349623352329
8646. in concluding this section we	should like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of	the primary decomposition theorem.	5.994169491148294
8647. we have chosen to give it at the	end of the section since it deals with differential equations and thus	is not purely linear algebra.	4.552370562549958
8648. in the primary decomposition	theorem it is not necessary that the vector space v	be finite dimensional nor is it necessary for parts that	p be the	minimal polynomial for t.	5.959211810514033
8649. if t is a linear operator	on an arbitrary vector space and if there is a monic polynomial	p such that f then parts of theorem 12 are valid	for t with the proof which we gave.	3.880750228719234
8650. let n be	a positive integer and let v be the space of all n times	continuously differentiable functions f on the real line which	satisfy the differential equation f where f are some fixed constants.	4.952420757110445
8651. if f denotes the space of n times continuously differentiable	functions then the space v of solutions of this differential	equation is a subspace of f.	3.895049632505127
8652. if d denotes the differentiation	operator and p is the polynomial f then v	is the null space of the operator p because f simply says	f.	5.232433280753718
8653. let us now regard d as a linear operator on the subspace	v.	5.0602254570385465
8654. if we are discussing differentiable complex-valued	functions then f and v are complex vector spaces	and f may be any complex numbers.	6.0301484566205845
8655. we now write f where f are	distinct complex numbers.	5.6943083428045975
8656. if f is the null space of f then theorem	12 says that f.	6.315369478924872
8657. in other words if f satisfies the differential	equation f then f is uniquely expressible in the	form f where f satisfies the differential equation f.	4.069764233728359
8658. thus the	study of the solutions to the equation f is reduced to the study of	the space of solutions of a differential equation of the form f.	5.141206576951538
8659. this	reduction has been accomplished by the general methods of linear algebra	ie	by the primary decomposition theorem.	4.245717626456428
8660. to describe	the space of solutions to f one must know something about differential	equations that is one must know something about d other	than the fact that it is a linear operator.	6.540805946767961
8661. however one does not	need to know very much.	5.9235710594296735
8662. it is very easy to establish by induction on	r that if f is in f then f that is f etc.	5.712245111298864
8663. thus	f if and only if f.	5.66037853959279
8664. a function g such that f ie	f must be a polynomial function of degree f or less: f.	5.684142655081116
8665. thus f satisfies f if and only if f has the form f.	4.716086338108351
8666. accordingly the 'functions' f span the space of solutions of	f.	6.8009341065019315
8667. since f are linearly independent functions and the exponential	function has no zeros these r functions f form a basis for	the space of solutions.	3.9488313816776532
8668. some experiments are composed	of repetitions of independent trials each with two possible	outcomes.	6.332890701313952
8669. the binomial probability distribution may describe the variation	that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment	to another.	3.906903531782282
8670. we devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not	only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real	life phenomena but also because it has important properties that recur	in many other probability models.	5.652426943994802
8671. we begin with a few examples of	binomial experiments.	6.546655248167848
8672. a trained marksman	shooting five rounds at a target all under practically the same conditions	may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times.	5.0249527528840945
8673. in repeated sets of	five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary.	4.910239423962009
8674. what can we say of the	probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes?	6.82531270916927
8675. 	in litters of eight mice from similar parents	the number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer	from 0 to 8.	3.725131536371901
8676. what probabilities should be attached to these possible	outcomes?	7.739422420849732
8677.   when three dice are	tossed repeatedly what is the probability that the number of aces is	0?	5.711220288802733
8678.   more generally	suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials	that each trial results in either a success or a non-success	and that the probability of success remains constant	from trial to trial.	5.697093225259587
8679. in the examples above the occurrence of	a bull's-eye	a straight-haired mouse or an ace could be called a success.	4.247421515042971
8680. in general any outcome we choose may be labeled success.	7.2170116025902145
8681. the major question in this chapter is: what is the probability	of exactly x successes in n trials?	4.196357911363403
8682.    in	chapters 3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples	usually by counting points in a sample space.	5.573471931685229
8683. fortunately a general	formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind.	4.780224508399226
8684. before	deriving this formula we explain what we mean by problems of this	kind.	6.072753158773726
8685. experiments are often composed of several identical	trials and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated.	4.305414028832856
8686. in the marksmanship	example a trial consists of one round shot at a target	with outcome either one bull's-eye.	5.671719354955688
8687. further an experiment might consist of five rounds and several sets	of five rounds might be regarded as a super-experiment composed of several	repetitions of the five-round experiment.	4.169182655838033
8688. if three dice are tossed	a trial is one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of	three trials.	5.712285764059603
8689. or what amounts to the same thing if one die is tossed	three times each toss is a trial and the three tosses form the experiment.	4.5413281696490335
8690. mathematically we shall not distinguish the experiment of	three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times.	5.59711476186222
8691. these	examples are illustrative of the use of the words trial and experiment	as they are used in this chapter but they are quite flexible	example	ten students act as managers for	a high-school football team and of these managers a proportion p	are licensed drivers.	4.198737245844719
8692. each friday one manager is chosen by lot to	stay late and load the equipment on a truck.	5.722649592970797
8693. on three fridays the coach	has needed a driver.	5.905861003792849
8694. considering only these fridays what is the	probability that the coach had drivers all 3 times?	5.749865620264723
8695.  exactly 2 times?	7.525342255260206
8696. 	1 time?	11.84209401893956
8697.  0 time?	8.815314306294878
8698.   note that there are 3 trials	of interest.	10.157065756336696
8699. each trial consists of choosing a student manager at	random.	5.38315506524164
8700. the 2 possible outcomes on each trial are driver or nondriver.	5.5068065744415025
8701. since the choice is by lot each week the outcomes of	different trials are independent.	5.128944997927505
8702. the managers stay the same so that	f is the same for all weeks.	5.8036435125645465
8703. we now generalize these ideas for general	binomial experiments.	6.021522492667592
8704. for an experiment to qualify as a	binomial experiment it must have four properties: there must	be a fixed number of trials each trial must result in a success	or a failure all trials must have	identical probabilities of success the trials must be independent	of each other.	4.920571084044724
8705. below we use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate	these four properties.	4.777056255974511
8706. we also give for each property an example	where the property is absent.	6.528893020462281
8707. the language and notation introduced	1.	5.385709227258292
8708. there must be a fixed	number n of repeated trials.	9.61378495624912
8709. we study sets	of five shots; for the mice we restrict attention to litters	experiment	toss a die until an ace appears.	4.102358227451361
8710. here the number of trials is a random variable not a fixed number.	7.811397402430579
8711. each of the n trials is either a success	or a failure.	5.744350837033391
8712. success and failure are just convenient	labels for the two categories of outcomes when we talk about binomial	trials in general.	5.885673004166722
8713. these words are more expressive than labels like	a and not-a.	4.964989440809417
8714. it is natural from the marksman's	viewpoint to call a bull's-eye a success but in the mice example	it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse.	5.456550589037899
8715. the word binomial means of two names or of two terms	and both usages apply in our work: the first to the names of the	two outcomes of a binomial trial and the second to the terms p	and f that represent the probabilities of success and failure.	3.63705584186414
8716. sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial	we group these outcomes into two classes as in the example of the die	where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes ace and not-ace.	6.121281709794788
8717. we classify	mice as straight-haired or wavy-haired but a hairless	mouse appears.	5.112998644077613
8718. we can escape from such a difficulty by ruling out the	animal as not constituting a trial but such a solution is not always	satisfactory.	5.60148135894056
8719. each die has probability f of producing an ace; the marksman	has some probability p perhaps 0.	4.34174111355853
8720. 1 of making a bull's-eye.	10.167755703368544
8721. note that we need not know the value of p for the experiment	to be binomial.	5.811939811330638
8722. during	a round of target practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and dazzles	4.	5.737064133858825
8723. this means that the probability	for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by	multiplying together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the	single binomial trials.	4.052688658130765
8724. thus in the three-dice example f f and	the independence assumption implies that the probability that the three	dice fall ace not-ace ace in that order is.	5.496249466654405
8725. experimentally	we expect independence when the trials have nothing to	do with one another.	4.411891185517149
8726. a family	of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains	and a coin is tossed to decide.	5.351488607394359
8727. we want to know the number of people	going to the mountains.	7.265559293822339
8728. when this experiment is viewed as composed	of five binomial trials one for each member of the family the outcomes	of the trials are obviously not independent.	6.411997404078352
8729. indeed the experiment	is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire	family.	4.7189233596206135
8730. the following is a less extreme example of dependence.	6.5298564688748195
8731. consider	couples visiting an art museum.	6.094118058689911
8732. each person votes for one of a pair	of pictures to receive a popular prize.	7.156599487473799
8733. voting for one picture may	be called success for the other failure.	4.535752126583474
8734. an experiment	consists of the voting of one couple or two trials.	6.536427962596809
8735. in repetitions	of the experiment from couple to couple the votes of the two persons	in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply because	couples who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar	tastes than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population	of visitors.	3.5599424685038947
8736. table 7-1 illustrates the point.	8.18656221502958
8737. the table shows	that 0.	5.528019901934595
8738. 6 of the boys and 0.	9.406545244794767
8739. 6 of the girls vote for picture a.	5.154284592154539
8740. therefore under independent voting f or 0.	7.900101709918028
8741. 36 of the couples would	cast two votes for picture a and f or 0.	4.21292691591616
8742. 16 would cast	two votes for picture b.	7.1581511048922275
8743. thus in independent voting f or 0.	6.482556679831107
8744. 52	of the couples would agree.	8.18656221502958
8745. but table 7-1 shows that f or 0.	5.478714475307434
8746. 70 agree	too many for independent voting.	7.603896187885215
8747. each performance of an n-trial	binomial experiment results in some whole number from 0	through n as the value of the random variable x where	f.	4.416405292675721
8748. we want to study the probability function of this random variable.	7.933430283874213
8749. for example we are interested in the number of bull's-eyes	not which shots were bull's-eyes.	6.327517446317763
8750. a binomial experiment can produce	random variables other than the number of successes.	7.503318358366108
8751. for example the	marksman gets 5 shots but we take his score to be the number of shots	before his first bull's-eye that is 0 1 2 3 4	.	4.576770072860325
8752. thus we do not score the number of bull's-eyes	and the random variable is not the number of successes.	8.755812765178398
8753. the constancy of p and the independence are the conditions most	likely to give trouble in practice.	3.7635883207428518
8754. obviously very slight changes	in p do not change the probabilities much and a slight lack of	independence may not make an appreciable difference.	5.320103015275459
8755. on the	other hand even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical	phenomenon being studied the binomial model may still be used	as a baseline for comparative purposes; that is we may discuss the	to	a binomial experiment consists of f independent	binomial trials all with the same probability f of yielding a success.	3.6619346907732946
8756. the outcome of the experiment is x successes.	7.013270918369849
8757. the random	variable x takes the values f with probabilities f or more	briefly f.	3.93777821379478
8758. we shall find a formula for the probability of	exactly x successes for given values of p and n.	5.819630184835506
8759. when	each number of successes x is paired with its probability of	occurrence f the set of pairs f is a probability function called	a binomial distribution.	3.692532313021866
8760. the choice of p and n determines	the binomial distribution uniquely and different choices always	produce different distributions	.	5.699791237282058
8761. the set of all binomial distributions is	called the family of binomial distributions but in general discussions	this expression is often shortened to the binomial distribution	or even the binomial when the context is clear.	3.618135523872156
8762. binomial distributions	were treated by james bernoulli about 1700 and for this	random	each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces	either 0 or 1 success.	5.051766433984403
8763. therefore each binomial trial can be thought	of as producing a value of a random variable associated with that	trial and taking the values 0 and 1 with probabilities q and	p respectively.	3.7163496544215224
8764. the several trials of a binomial experiment	produce a new random variable x the total number of successes	which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single	trials.	5.156455616667386
8765. the marksman gets two bull's-eyes one	on his third shot and one on his fifth.	3.872342767520762
8766. the numbers of successes on	the five individual shots are then 0 0 1 0 1.	5.124468832995878
8767. the number of successes	on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0	or 1 and there are 5 such random variables here.	4.103053130184461
8768. their sum is x	the total number of successes which in this experiment has the	value f.	6.101500819619034
8769. consider a simple closed plane curve c which is a real-analytic	image of the unit circle and which is given by f.	4.412382826823392
8770. these	are real analytic periodic functions with period t.	7.2940933397716075
8771. in the	following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense exactly	an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does	not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares.	3.9207517224730632
8772. this theorem	is similar to the theorem of kakutani that there exists a circumscribing	cube around any closed bounded convex set in f.	5.2940225553249896
8773. the latter theorem	has been generalized by yamabe and yujobo and cairns to show	that in f there are families of such cubes.	3.8517523403823315
8774. here for the case of	squares inscribed in plane curves we remove the restriction to convexity	and give certain other results.	5.82615722890252
8775. a square inscribed in a curve	c means a square with its four corner points on the curve	though it may not lie entirely in the interior of c.	3.7363034122966403
8776. indeed	the spiral f with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses	only one inscribed square.	6.158206115968873
8777. the square has one corner point on	the straight line segment and does not lie entirely in the interior.	3.9582371803250562
8778. on c from the point p at f to the point q	at f we construct the chord and upon the chord as a side	erect a square in such a way that as s approaches zero the square	is inside c.	5.474173847601041
8779. as s increases we consider the two free	corner points of the square f and f adjacent to p and q	respectively.	4.549672957421131
8780. as s approaches t the square will	be outside c and therefore both f and f must cross c	an odd number of times as s varies from zero to t.	5.14278638992628
8781. the points may also touch c without crossing.	4.465007080332922
8782. suppose	f crosses c when f.	8.18656221502958
8783. we now have certain squares with three	corners on c.	6.015720905784279
8784. for any such square the middle corner of these	will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the	curve will be called the diagonal point of the square.	5.185072584132448
8785. each point on	c as a vertex may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal	points by the above construction.	4.1869681482515695
8786. to each paired vertex	and diagonal point there corresponds a unique forward corner point	ie the corner on c reached first by proceeding along c	from the vertex in the direction of increasing t.	5.163933232131142
8787. if the	vertex is at f and if the interior of c is on the left as	one moves in the direction of increasing t then every such corner	can be found from the curve obtained by rotating c clockwise	through 90` about the vertex.	4.01639487193029
8788. the set of intersections of f	the rotated curve with the original curve c consists of just	the set of forward corner points on c corresponding to the vertex	at f plus the vertex itself.	4.555360135712379
8789. we note that two such curves c	and f cannot coincide at more than a finite number of points;	otherwise being analytic they would coincide at all points which	is impossible since they do not coincide near f.	4.133876272679744
8790. with each	vertex we associate certain numerical values namely the set of positive	differences in the parameter t between the vertex and its corresponding	forward corner points.	5.2472187260976755
8791. for the vertex at f these values	will be denoted by f.	5.2920800133126
8792. the function f defined in this way	is multi-valued.	5.998227019452429
8793. we consider now the graph of the function	f on f.	5.112047505587515
8794. we will refer to the plane of c and f as	the c-plane and to the plane of the graph as the f-plane.	7.3885743363219545
8795. the graph as a set may have a finite number of components.	4.4290627444634225
8796. we	will denote the values of f on different components by f.	6.264280393961424
8797. each point with abscissa t on the graph represents an intersection	between c and f.	4.538698786785084
8798. there are two types of such intersections	depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point	of intersection.	6.166084234850267
8799. an ordinary point will be any point of intersection	a such that in every neighborhood of a in the c-plane	f meets both the interior and the exterior of c.	3.892517727906305
8800. any other point of intersection between c and f will be called	a tangent point.	6.168176899525268
8801. this terminology will also be applied to the	corresponding points in the f-plane.	5.61989788398186
8802. we can now prove several	lemmas.	11.397542878406627
8803. in some neighborhood in the f-plane of	any ordinary point of the graph the function f is a single-valued	continuous function.	4.381178710447689
8804. we first show that the function	is	single-valued in some neighborhood.	8.015268549856321
8805. with the vertex at f in the c-plane	we assume that f is the parametric location on c	of an ordinary intersection q between c and f.	3.951907294942372
8806. in	the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are	f.	7.242633331364014
8807. we know that in the c-plane both c and f are analytic.	6.335215021889672
8808. in the c-plane we construct a set of rectangular cartesian	coordinates u v with the origin at q and	such that both c and f have finite slope at q.	5.074836214302409
8809. near	q both curves can be represented by analytic functions of	u.	4.681571082223364
8810. in a neighborhood of q the difference between these	functions is also a single-valued analytic function of u.	7.141513536840279
8811. furthermore	one can find a neighborhood of q in which the difference	function is monotone for since it is analytic it can have only	a finite number of extrema in any interval.	4.103704518729345
8812. now to find f one needs	the intersection of c and f near q.	6.692645829018845
8813. but f is just	the curve f translated without rotation through a small arc for	f is always obtained by rotating c through exactly 90`.	3.8567561298752464
8814. the	arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve.	6.745632588036352
8815. thus if e is	sufficiently	small there can be only one intersection of c and	f near q for if there were more than one intersection for every	e then the difference between c and f near q	would not be a monotone function.	4.321408959494399
8816. therefore f is single-valued	near q.	9.23531195460488
8817. it is also seen that f since the change from f	to f is accomplished by a continuous translation.	4.5379463936144235
8818. thus f is also	continuous at f and in a neighborhood of f which does not contain	a tangent point.	6.511086312788945
8819. we turn now to the set of tangent points on	the graph.	5.114003531107478
8820. this set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals.	6.446424284182295
8821. the fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except	in closed intervals follows from the argument used in lemma 1 namely	that near any tangent point in the c-plane the curves c	and f are analytic and therefore the difference between them	must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the	tangent point.	3.6612671341174696
8822. this prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence	of isolated tangent points.	6.318190046996345
8823. in some neighborhood of	an	isolated tangent point in the f-plane say f the function f is	either double-valued or has no values defined except at the tangent	point itself where it is single-valued.	4.247735062670402
8824. a tangent point	q in the c-plane occurs when c and f are	tangent to one another.	5.5103408352902035
8825. a continuous change in t through an amount	e results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve	f.	3.8647511751838657
8826. there are three possibilities: f remains tangent to	c as it is translated; f moves away from c and	does not intersect it at all for f; f cuts across c	and there are two ordinary intersections for every t in f.	5.3295236757889555
8827. the	first possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points	in the f-plane the end points of which fall into category	or.	4.030798966093396
8828. in the second category the function f has no values defined	in a neighborhood f.	6.571538416515428
8829. in the third category the function is double-valued	in this interval.	5.661099871571294
8830. the same remarks apply to an interval on the	other side of f.	6.036798110429278
8831. again the analyticity of the two curves guarantee	that such intervals exist.	6.024941273585355
8832. in the neighborhood of an end point of an	interval of tangent points in the f-plane the function is two-valued	or no-valued on one side and is a single-valued function consisting	entirely of tangent points on the other side.	5.862974995781887
8833. with the	above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of f.	5.164894894054128
8834. first for any value of t for which all values of f	are ordinary points the number of values of f must be	odd.	5.956873911523869
8835. for it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections	of c and f must be even	and the	center of rotation at t is the argument of the function not a	value.	4.340117322606295
8836. therefore for any value of t the number of values of	f is equal to the number of tangent points corresponding	to the argument t plus an odd number.	6.252372310386742
8837. the	number of ordinary values of the function f at t	will be called its multiplicity at t.	4.354158697550415
8838. the graph	of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval	0t.	6.139164405134221
8839. then every component	of the graph of f must be defined over a bounded sub-interval.	4.495130370609393
8840. suppose f is defined in the sub-interval f.	7.573345682652719
8841. now f and f	must both be tangent points on the nth component in the f-plane;	otherwise by lemma 1 the component would extend beyond	these points.	3.8865793515575056
8842. further we see by lemma 2 that the multiplicity of	f can only change at a tangent point and at such a point can	only change by an even integer.	5.1082999685422745
8843. thus the multiplicity of f for a given	t must be an even number.	5.111108549280613
8844. this is true of all components	which have such a bounded support.	8.457175754976642
8845. but this is a contradiction for we	know that the multiplicity of f is odd for every t.	5.1622551124898814
8846. we have shown that the graph of f contains at least one	component whose inverse is the entire interval 0t and	whose multiplicity is odd.	5.492533674335549
8847. there must be an odd number of such components	which will be called complete components.	5.697566623150925
8848. the remaining	components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument	and are defined only on a proper	sub-interval of 0t.	4.907924222969931
8849. we must now show that on some component of the graph there exist	two points for which the corresponding diagonal points in the c-plane	are on opposite sides of c.	4.226954253379676
8850. we again consider a	fixed point p at f and a variable point q at f on	c.	5.801506373762039
8851. we erect a square with pq as a side and with free	corners f and f adjacent to p and q respectively.	4.157716699229611
8852. as s varies from zero to t the values of s for	which f and f cross c will be denoted by f and f	respectively.	5.480868968972665
8853. we have f plus tangent points.	7.042335069472337
8854. these s-values	are just the ordinary values of f.	7.2939254200701615
8855. the values f	are the ordinary values at f of a multi-valued function g	which has components corresponding to those of f.	3.8961201863368675
8856. we first define a function b as follows: given the	set of squares such that each has three corners on c and vertex	at t b is the corresponding set of positive parametric	differences between t and the backward corner points.	4.763404022266411
8857. the functions f and b have exactly the same multiplicity	at every argument t.	4.0644945306339
8858. now with p fixed at f f-values	occur when the corner f crosses c and are among the values	of s such that f.	5.553300793804824
8859. the roots of this equation are just the	ordinates of the intersections of the graph of b with a straight	line of unit slope through f in the b-plane	.	3.49269332853124
8860. we define these values as f and define g	in the same way for each t.	6.533344173016092
8861. thus we obtain g	by introducing an oblique g-axis in the b-plane.	5.150612458858557
8862. in 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions	in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex	numbers.	5.778453424718824
8863. these are defined by a simple involutorial transformation	of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface	bearing a curve of symbol f.	4.2724883377831295
8864. then in 2 we show that any line	involution with the properties that it has no complex of invariant	lines and its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively	of the lines which meet a twisted curve is necessarily of the	type discussed in 1.	5.04267183815797
8865. no generalization of these results to spaces	of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible.	4.463998506838007
8866. let q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli f	and f and let \g be a f curve of order k on q.	5.4042109428577705
8867. a	general line l meets q in two points f and f through	each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus f whose	lines are simple secants of \g.	3.700729374541182
8868. on these generators let f and	f be respectively the harmonic conjugates of f and f with respect	to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets \g.	5.879546477810705
8869. the line f is the image of l.	5.774309563718432
8870. clearly the transformation	is involutorial.	9.679286962862566
8871. we observe first that no line l	can meet its image except at one of its intersections with q.	4.487270837055201
8872. for if it did the plane of l and l' would contain	two generators of f which is impossible.	6.072106635478565
8873. moreover from the definitive	transformation of intercepts on the generators of f it is clear	that the only points of q at which a line can meets its image	are the points of \g.	3.7007221636736447
8874. hence the totality of singular lines is	the kth order complex of lines which meet \g.	6.0490020110871985
8875. the	invariant lines are the lines of the congruence of secants of \g	since each of these meets q in two points which are invariant.	4.129178514092727
8876. the order of this congruence is f since f secants of a curve of	symbol  on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point.	5.251524548687677
8877. the class of the congruence is f since an arbitrary plane meets	\g in k points.	3.925535043995563
8878. since the complex of singular	lines is of order k and since there is no complex of invariant	lines it follows from the formula f that the order of the involution	is f.	5.98975082224057
8879. there are various sets of exceptional lines or lines	whose images are not unique.	4.813654836059139
8880. the most obvious of these is the quadratic	complex of tangents to q each line of which is transformed	into the entire pencil of lines tangent to q at the image	of the point of tangency of the given line.	5.192935567251536
8881. thus pencils of	tangents to q are transformed into pencils of tangents.	5.029116719890252
8882. it is	interesting that a 1:1 correspondence can be established between the	lines of two such pencils so that in a sense a unique image can actually	be assigned to each tangent.	5.67929459597284
8883. for the lines of any plane |p	meeting q in a conic c are transformed into the congruence	of secants of the curve c' into which c is	transformed in the point involution on q.	3.783210459201811
8884. in particular tangents	to c are transformed into tangents to c'.	6.814862860381419
8885. moreover	if f and f are two planes intersecting in a line l tangent	to q at a point p the two free intersections of	the image curves f and f must coincide at p' the image	of p and at this point f and f must have a common tangent	l'.	3.839192920137815
8886. hence thought of as a line in a particular plane |p	any tangent to q has a unique image and moreover this image	is the same for all planes through l.	5.406766141507786
8887. each generator	|l of f is also exceptional for each is transformed into the	entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator	is transformed by the point involution on q.	3.68350333733217
8888. this curve is of	symbol f since it meets |l and hence every line of f in the	f invariant points on |l and since it obviously meets every line	of f in a single point.	4.936619805870358
8889. the congruence of its secants is therefore	of order f and class f.	4.012715720819275
8890. a final class of exceptional lines	is identifiable from the following considerations: since no two	generators of f can intersect it follows that their image curves	can have no free intersections.	4.982457546272996
8891. in other words these curves have only	fixed intersections common to them all.	5.230623353578018
8892. now the only way in which all	curves of the image family of f can pass through a fixed point is	to have a generator of f which is not a secant but a tangent of \g	for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into	the point of tangency.	5.359983498853555
8893. since two curves of symbol f on q intersect	in f points it follows that there are f lines of f which	are tangent to \g.	4.349110423196337
8894. clearly any line l of any bundle	having one of these points of tangency t as vertex will be transformed	into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection	of l and q as vertex and lying in the plane determined	by the image point and the generator of f which is tangent to	\g at t.	4.909933583340759
8895. a line through two of these points f and f	will be transformed into the entire bilinear congruence having the	tangents to \g at f and f as directrices.	3.862310490065276
8896. a conic c	being a curve on q meets the image of any line	of f which we have already found to be a f curve on q	in f points.	6.107258845897474
8897. hence its image c' meets any line of f	in f points.	5.1516031992244855
8898. moreover c' obviously meets any line f in	a single point.	7.120679282177504
8899. hence c' is a f curve on q.	5.6876388648922
8900. therefore	the congruence of its secants that is the image of a general	plane field of lines is of order f and class f.	6.2503231753561925
8901. finally the image	of a general bundle of lines is a congruence whose order is the order	of the congruence of invariant lines namely f and whose class is	the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines	namely f.	3.6672354358781725
8902. the preceding observations make it clear that there	exist line involutions of all orders greater than 1 with no complex	of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consisting exclusively	of the lines which meet a twisted curve \g.	4.739278828627602
8903. we now shall	show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily	of the type we have just described.	4.626275705325549
8904. to do this we must first	show that every line which meets \g in a point p meets its	image at p.	5.893925219575856
8905. to see this consider a general pencil of lines	containing a general secant of \g.	4.663094491132033
8906. by the image of this pencil	is a ruled surface of order f which is met by the plane of the	pencil in a curve c of order f.	5.727588046598535
8907. on c there is a	f correspondence in which the f points cut from c by a general	line l of the pencil correspond to the point of intersection	of the image of l and the plane of the pencil.	4.502224742908685
8908. since c	is rational this correspondence has k coincidences each	of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image.	5.64563451354438
8909. however	since the pencil contains a secant of \g it actually contains only	f singular lines.	4.21292691591616
8910. to avoid this contradiction it is necessary that	c be composite with the secant of \g and a curve of	order f as components.	5.569354680128485
8911. thus it follows that the secants of \g	are all invariant.	5.523318448661567
8912. but if this is the case then an arbitrary pencil	of lines having a point p of \g as vertex is transformed	into a ruled surface of order f having f generators concurrent at	p.	5.582019069851376
8913. since a ruled surface of order n with n concurrent	generators	is necessarily a cone it follows finally that every line through	a point p of \g meets its image at p as asserted.	3.702582161826494
8914. now consider the transformation of the lines of a bundle	with vertex p on \g which is effected by the involution	as a whole.	5.5344331965343585
8915. from the preceding remarks it is clear that such a bundle	is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion.	5.000367581966212
8916. moreover	in this involution there is a cone of invariant lines of order f namely	the cone of secants of \g which pass through p.	5.484175529098316
8917. hence	it follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective	de jonquieres involution of order f and the invariant locus must	have a multiple line of multiplicity either f or f.	3.697740462057376
8918. the first possibility	requires that there be a line through p which meets	\g in f points; the second requires that there be a line through	p which meets \g in f points.	5.0124483599365
8919. in each case lines	of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they	determine with the multiple secant.	4.359420610098695
8920. in the first case the fixed elements	within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line joining the	vertex p to the intersection of \g and the plane of	the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant.	5.04907083351659
8921. in the second	the fixed elements are the lines which join the vertex p to	the two intersections of \g and the plane of the pencil which do	not lie on the multiple secant.	3.7701126411664294
8922. the multiple secants of course are	exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order f.	5.385945353824018
8923. observations similar to these can be made at each point of \g.	5.023035223684463
8924. hence \g must have either a regulus of f-fold secants or	a regulus of f-fold secants.	5.970791658237855
8925. moreover if f no two of the multiple	secants can intersect.	6.0929233204253235
8926. for if such were the case either the plane	of the two lines would meet \g in more than k points or	alternatively the order of the image regulus of the pencil determined	by the two lines would be too high.	5.325828674264494
8927. but if no two lines of the regulus	of multiple secants of \g can intersect then the regulus must	be quadratic or in other words \g must be either a f or a f	curve on a nonsingular quadric surface.	3.9684655304239183
8928. we now observe that	the case in which \g is a f curve on a quadric is impossible if	the complex of singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which	meet \g.	5.264785593739965
8929. for any pencil in a plane containing a f-fold secant	of \g has an image regulus which meets the plane of the pencil	in f lines namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass	through the intersection of \g and the multiple secant plus an additional	component to account for the intersections of the images of	the general lines of the pencil.	3.6029257883545704
8930. however if there is no additional complex	of singular lines the order of the image regulus of a pencil is	precisely f.	7.324269387323433
8931. this contradicts the preceding observations and so	under the assumption of this paper we must reject the possibility that	\g is a f curve on a quadric surface.	3.67686407923982
8932. continuing with	the case in which \g is a f curve on a quadric q we first	observe that the second regulus of q consists precisely of	the lines which join the two free intersections of \g and the planes	through any one of the multiple secants.	4.930644792525595
8933. for each of these lines	meets q in three points namely two points on \g and one	point on one of the multiple secants.	4.874963911887515
8934. now consider an arbitrary	line l meeting q in two points f and f.	6.292765392603726
8935. if	|a is the multiple secant of \g which passes through f and	|b is the simple secant of \g which passes through f and	if f are the points in which |a meets \g and if f is the	image of f on the generator |b it follows that the image of	the line f is f.	3.3168289875321095
8936. these societies can expect to face difficult times.	7.630283945429465
8937. as the historic	processes of modernization gradually gain momentum their cohesion	will be threatened by divisive forces the gaps between rulers and	subjects town and country will widen; new aspirants for power will	emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence; old rulers may	lose their nerve and their sense of direction.	3.4767349067322773
8938. national leaders will	have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people	through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men's	sense of identity.	5.1320431459084235
8939. feelings of a community of interest will have to	be recreated- in some of the new nations indeed they must be built	for the first time- on a new basis which looks toward the future and	does not rely only on shared memories of the past.	3.9825444952088453
8940. nevertheless with	foresight and careful planning some of the more disruptive and dangerous	consequences of social change which have troubled other countries	passing through this stage can be escaped.	5.922964130040273
8941. the united states can	help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries	face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms	of assistance where possible.	3.8055826155184063
8942. our central goal should be	to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle	boldly the tasks which they face.	5.424403994642715
8943. at the same time we should recognize	that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability	which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone	to diversions and external adventures of all sorts.	4.267959649098016
8944. it may seem to some	of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing	in the	murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable	tasks at home.	5.679051645821225
8945. we should do what we can to discourage this conclusion	both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting	firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene.	4.471959514771223
8946. when necessary	we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal	advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential for	disrupting the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but	also risk their own prospects for orderly development.	5.512272429856898
8947. as a nation	we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development;	but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly	seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world	community.	3.910472613382279
8948. when we look at countries like	iran iraq pakistan and burma where substantial progress has been	made	in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital	and where institutions of centralized government exist we find	a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence	different priorities for policy.	4.753461523007245
8949. the men in power are committed	in principle to modernization but economic and social changes are proceeding	only erratically.	4.4646804196443295
8950. isolated enterprises have been launched but	they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern.	6.361574442547495
8951. the	society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban	sector and a relatively untouched rural sector with very poor communications	between the two.	4.23143801216645
8952. progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions	to effective action among those in power and by a failure on	their part to understand how local resources human and material can	be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically	accepted.	4.919918969962851
8953. most countries in this second category share	the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political	and social system without the modern standards of performance required	to make them effective.	4.076357337102832
8954. in these rapidly changing societies there	is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals.	6.951866096507661
8955. the colonial period has generally left people believing that government	can if it wishes provide all manner of services for them-	and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the	benefits of modern life.	3.743101157532715
8956. for example in accordance with the fashion	of the times most transitional societies have announced economic development	plans of varying numbers of years; such is the mystique of	planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow	automatically upon its announcement.	5.351704536885061
8957. the civil services in such societies	are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing	them; and their members often equate a government career with security	and status rather than with sacrifice self-discipline and competence.	3.396385422347032
8958. american policy should press constantly the view that	until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their	bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize	of democratize their societies.	5.782886268632087
8959. we should spread the view that	planning and national development are serious matters which call for	effort as well as enthusiasm.	4.89389470757858
8960. above all we should seek to encourage	the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they	are responsible for their fates.	5.7186098565892625
8961. only within the framework of a mature	relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can	we provide telling assistance.	4.347493182251874
8962. with respect to those countries whose	leaders prefer to live with their illusions we can afford to wait	for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all	to see.	5.339675020241304
8963. our technical assistance to these countries should	place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the	role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts	assumed in dealing with the central governments.	3.7322241997648997
8964. we should encourage	the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities	state and provincial governments rural communities and other smaller	groups making certain that no important segment of the economy is	neglected.	5.320763387376736
8965. simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships	of technical progress in various fields showing how agricultural	training can be introduced into education how health affects labor	productivity how small business can benefit the rural farm community	and above all how progress in each field relates to national progress.	3.4588703563932515
8966. efforts such as the community development program in the philippines	have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward	balanced national development.	5.832902274791602
8967. to achieve this goal of balanced development	communications between the central government and the local communities	must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves	are effectively taken into account.	4.477856495836598
8968. if modernization programs	are imposed from above without the understanding and cooperation of	the people they will encounter grave difficulties.	5.664181435963597
8969. land reform	is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries.	6.6235277192257005
8970. it should	be american policy not only to encourage effective land reform	programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic	growth and modernization of the society.	5.608052801592143
8971. as an isolated policy	land reform is likely to be politically disruptive; as part of a larger	development effort however it may gain wide acceptance.	5.339636821426662
8972. it should	also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved	by administrative decrees alone.	6.70091036931843
8973. land reform programs need to be	supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance	in agriculture.	4.09680761620383
8974. lastly governmental and private planners	will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming	ahead.	5.724071237696648
8975. by holding out prospects for external capital assistance the	united states can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted	economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth.	3.82951812698378
8976. modernizing societies	at a third stage in the modernization	process are such countries as india brazil the philippines and	taiwan which are ready and committed to move into the stage of self-sustaining	growth.	5.074433871657863
8977. they must continue to satisfy basic capital needs;	and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity	around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing	participation in the program to wider and wider groups.	3.7826743528889133
8978. but these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary	human and social overhead capital; they have established reasonably	stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local	levels; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically	and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies.	4.953553659358183
8979. on the economic front the first priority of these countries	is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources.	4.309157056228794
8980. several related	tasks must be carried out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved.	8.090980472462304
8981. these countries must formulate a comprehensive long-term program	covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors	of the economy.	4.282689700678104
8982. they must in their planning be able to count on at least	tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods	of several years.	6.138933127297629
8983. capital imports drawn from a number of sources must	be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment	programming to go forward.	4.216302073162282
8984. capital flows must be coordinated with	national needs and planning.	6.522871687113793
8985. finally a balance must be effected among	project finance utilization of agricultural surpluses and general	balance of payments support.	4.296125541903337
8986. thus although the agenda of external	assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative and many of the	policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant	the basic purpose of american economic policy during the later stages	of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining	growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange.	4.968455750776203
8987. there remain many political and administrative problems to be solved.	5.641702390061126
8988. for one thing although considerable numbers of men have been trained	bureaucracies are still deficient in many respects; even the	famed indian civil service is not fully adequate to the tremendous	range of tasks it has undertaken.	5.107108426197848
8989. technical assistance in training middle-	and upper-level management personnel is still needed in many cases.	4.245362623818629
8990. there are also more basic problems.	10.118080246421345
8991. this is the stage at which democratic	developments must take place if the society is to become an	open community of creative people.	4.217579574944413
8992. nevertheless impulses still exist	among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need	for centralized and authoritarian practices.	5.597414555320442
8993. another great danger is	that the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly alienated	from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference	to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism.	3.672790725939303
8994. the capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional	classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to	be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their	own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts	in the west.	5.072150874407012
8995. particularly when based upon a single dominant party	governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of	understanding about the national interest.	3.725131536371901
8996. convinced of the wisdom of	their own actions and reassured by the promises of their economic development	programs governments may fail to push outward to win more	and more people to the national effort becoming instead more rigid and	inflexible in their policies.	4.778776177296164
8997. american policy toward such societies	should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional	classes.	4.848846624571699
8998. it should attempt to communicate both an appreciation	of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers	and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies.	6.005630318411373
8999. we	have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic	and free countries; we also have in consequence the duty to appraise	realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate	our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways.	3.507008336253105
9000. factor	we have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society	will take a considerable period of time.	5.610183044423355
9001. with the exception of	treaty-making foreign relations were historically concerned for the	most part with conditions of short or at least measurable duration.	4.908342761650614
9002. foreign	policy now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled	not merely at response but also at projection.	5.670054857772145
9003. american and free-world	policies can marginally affect the pace of transition; but basically	that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in	the human attitudes political institutions and social structure which	each society must generate.	3.779094983301935
9004. it follows that any effective policy toward	the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working	horizon.	6.949658107617871
9005. it must be marked by a patience and persistence which have	not always been its trademark.	5.1544731091808735
9006. this condition affects not only	the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign	policy especially in the context of economic aid.	6.037368705366322
9007. the place of	religion in the simple preliterate societies is quite definite; as	a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly	in every part of it.	3.762698880705594
9008. in societies like ours however its place	is less clear and more complex.	6.179276972815976
9009. with the diversity of religious viewpoints	there are differences of opinion as to the essential features	of religion; and there are different opinions as to the essential	functions of religion.	4.791252561183742
9010. nevertheless for most of the population of heterogeneous	advanced societies though less for the less religious portion	religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions.	6.2715819948687495
9011. although the inner functions of religion are not of direct	significance in social organization they have important indirect consequences.	4.403479597760111
9012. if the inner functions of religion are performed the individual	is a composed ordered motivated and emotionally secure associate;	he is not greatly frustrated and he is not anomic; he is	better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows.	5.225419374903635
9013. there are	several closely related inner functions.	7.229157546564095
9014. in the last analysis	religion is the means of inducing formulating expressing enhancing	implementing and perpetuating man's deepest experience- the religious.	5.979170548327797
9015. man is first religious; the instrumentalities follow.	6.494006347560702
9016. religion	seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence.	6.806723317680827
9017. the significant	things in it at the higher religious levels are the inner emotional	mental and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs	of self-preservation self-pacification and self-completion.	3.5923671468629204
9018. the chief	experience is the sensing of communion and in the higher religions	of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power.	5.4791514353657575
9019. related to	this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual	his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively	secure in an ordered dependable universe.	5.010990367388003
9020. man has the experience	of being helpfully allied with what he cannot fully understand;	he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and	movement.	5.948731048823774
9021. the universe is a safe and permanent home.	5.075315958858594
9022. a number	of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the	ultimate and eternal.	5.853991709885976
9023. death is not permanent defeat and disappearance;	man has a second chance.	4.749331410112551
9024. he is not lost in the abyss of endless	time; he has endless being.	7.746559239154671
9025. religion at its best also offers the	experience of spiritual fulfillment by inviting man into the highest realm	of the spirit.	3.8880356915934375
9026. religion can summate epitomize relate and conserve	all the highest ideals and values- ethical aesthetic and religious-	of man formed in his culture.	5.103675880876918
9027. there is also the possibility	among higher religions of experiencing consistent meaning in life	and enjoying guidance and expansiveness.	5.038631305413246
9028. the kind of religious experience	that most moderns seek not only provides clarifies and relates	human yearnings values ideals and purposes; it also provides facilities	and incitements for the development of personality sociality	and creativeness.	5.1864353748163
9029. under the religious impulse whether theistic or	humanistic men have joy in living; life leads somewhere.	4.642392281852646
9030. religion	at its best is out in front ever beckoning and leading on and as lippman	put it mobilizing all man's scattered energies in one triumphant	sense of his own infinite importance.	5.169303252539972
9031. at the same	time	that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and	gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment it also has	great therapeutic value for him.	4.107360896505182
9032. it gives him aid comfort even solace	in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical	knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate.	5.5540622557976915
9033. he is confronted	with the recurrent crises such as great natural catastrophes and	the great transitions of life- marriage incurable disease widowhood	old age the certainty of death.	3.9915518801180743
9034. he has to cope with frustration	and other emotional disturbance and anomie.	8.14195328704718
9035. his religious beliefs provide	him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause	him great concern and his religious faith makes possible fortitude equanimity	and consolation enabling him to endure colossal misfortune	fear frustration uncertainty suffering evil and danger.	3.4992294503403554
9036. religion	usually also includes a principle of compensation mainly in a promised	perfect future state.	5.7836982265615156
9037. the belief in immortality where held	functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here	and now.	3.6768367662181762
9038. the tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing	or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less	self-contained or self-sufficient by confession repentance and penance.	4.669145759890817
9039. the feeling of individual inferiority defeat or humilation growing	out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures	is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly	but all-victorious father-god as well as by sympathetic fellowship	with others who share this faith and by opportunities in religious	acts for giving vent to emotions and energies.	3.428663868663587
9040. in providing	for these inner individual functions religion undertakes in behalf	of individual peace of mind and well-being services for which there is	no other institution.	5.358772432765396
9041. in addition to the functions of religion	within man there have always been the outer social functions for the	community and society.	4.696000464926153
9042. the two have never been separable.	8.077677005219657
9043. religion	is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation.	4.855658467968249
9044. the value-system of a community or society is always correlated with	and to a degree dependent upon a more or less shared system of religious	beliefs and convictions.	5.042220124258352
9045. the religion supports re-enforces	reaffirms and maintains the fundamental values.	4.320730508808147
9046. even in the united	states with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast	denominational differentiation there is a general consensus regarding	the basic christian values.	6.822865909550303
9047. this is demonstrated especially when there	is awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere;	for example americans rally to christian values vis-a-vis those	of atheistic communism.	4.0454570001799555
9048. in america also all of our major religious bodies	officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of	our common religion.	5.85865105009894
9049. even the non-church members- the freewheelers	marginal religionists and so on- have the values of christian civilization	internalized in them.	4.528558399904909
9050. furthermore religion tends to integrate	the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of god	to the intermediary and subordinate values; for example those regarding	material objects and pragmatic ends.	5.110573077301918
9051. finally it gives sanctity	more than human legitimacy and even through super-empirical reference	transcendent and supernatural importance to some values; for example	marriage as a sacrament much law-breaking as sinful occasionally	the state as a divine instrument.	3.6535383725553663
9052. it places certain values at least	beyond questioning and tampering.	7.689268745923757
9053. closely related to this	function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate	ends for the society which are compatible with the supreme eternal	ends.	4.596527152062705
9054. this something leads to a conception of an over-all social	plan with a meaning interpretable in terms of ultimate ends; for example	a plan that fulfills the will of god which advances the kingdom	of god which involves social life as part of the grand design.	5.467031944645958
9055. this explains some group ends and provides a justification of their	primacy.	4.789456337513211
9056. it gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs	of social action.	6.738732510197011
9057. finally it gives meaning to much social endeavor	and logic consistency and meaning to life.	4.641305706895583
9058. in general there is no	society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired	transcendental ends.	6.633960199254832
9059. some	of the oldest most persistent and most cohesive forms of social groupings	have grown out of religion.	4.177396032884076
9060. these groups have varied widely from	mere families primitive totemic groups and small modern cults and	sects to the memberships of great denominations and great widely	dispersed world religions.	5.019041591892522
9061. religion fosters group life in various ways.	5.3285636594893
9062. the common ultimate values ends and goals fostered by religion are	a most important factor.	5.4890628405123625
9063. without a system of values there can be no	society.	6.864429706882687
9064. where such a value system prevails it always unifies all	who possess it; it enables members of the society to operate as a system.	5.9155406509217
9065. the beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed	in creeds dogmas and doctrines and form what durkheim calls a credo.	3.5473748551672966
9066. as he points out a religious group cannot exist without a collective	credo and the more extensive the credo the more unified and strong	is the group.	5.606158451658095
9067. the credo unifies and socializes men by attaching	them completely to an identical body of doctrine; the more extensive	and firm the body of doctrine the firmer the group.	3.6267791784963044
9068. the religious	symbolism and especially the closely related rites and worship	forms constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith.	5.433724058565319
9069. the religion in fact is an expression of the unity of the group	small or large.	4.469380230733164
9070. the common codes for religious action as such and	in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior bind the devotees	together.	5.0995364467391315
9071. these are ways of jointly participating in significantly	symbolized standardized and ordered religiously sanctified behavior.	4.720734897723555
9072. the codes are mechanism for training in and directing and enforcing	uniform social interaction and for continually and publicly reasserting	the solidarity of the group.	4.751884320492174
9073. durkheim noted long ago that	religion as h a unified system of beliefs and practices relative	to sacred things h unites into one single moral community h	all	those who adhere to them.	3.562115886365008
9074. his view is that every religion pertains	to	a community and conversely every community is in one aspect a religious	unit.	5.674941972410823
9075. this is brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails	even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular	semi-public and public occasions in the united states; and it is	evidenced in the prayers offered in the frequent religious allusions	and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds.	3.993850363213731
9076. the	unifying effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically	peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural	units with religion as the dominant bond even though spatially dispersed	and not politically organized.	5.497371982168858
9077. the jews for 2500 years have been	a prime example though the adherents of any world or interpeople religion	are cases in point.	3.6038842595995173
9078. it might be pointed out that the integrating	function of religion for good or ill has often supported or been	identified with other groupings- political nationality language class	racial sociability even economic.	5.687379081655061
9079. religion usually exercises	a stabilizing-conserving function.	6.094118058689911
9080. as such it acts as an anchor	for the people.	7.863338418950815
9081. there is a marked tendency for religions once firmly	established to resist change not only in their own doctrines and policies	and practices but also in secular affairs having religious relevance.	4.534622962951788
9082. it has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of	social values though also in some measure an obstacle to the creation	or diffusion of new ones.	5.600825653172288
9083. it tends to support the longstanding precious	sentiments the traditional ways of thinking and the customary ways	of living.	4.630570760044813
9084. as yinger has pointed out the h reliance on symbols	on tradition on sacred writings on the cultivation of emotional	feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values turns one to the	past far more than to the future.	5.208843682609572
9085. historically religion has also	functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication enforcement sanction	and perpetuation of various other institutions.	4.113952705112461
9086. at the same	time that religion exercises a conserving influence it also energizes	and motivates both individuals and groups.	6.070227054784718
9087. much of the important	individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives.	5.456036415712056
9088. the	great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon	lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force	mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices; for example the crusades	mission efforts just wars.	5.359483399699403
9089. much effort has been expended in the	sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion.	4.716685382082387
9090. the	insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating	effects.	6.289010577019261
9091. religion provides the most attractive rewards either	in this world or the next for those who not merely abide by its norms	but who engage in good works.	3.939760520728359
9092. religion usually acts as a	powerful	aid in social control enforcing what men should or should not	do.	5.550554466109728
9093. among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were	more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group;	and in modern societies such influence is still great.	4.343004377977767
9094. religion has	its own supernatural prescriptions that are at the same time codes	of behavior for the here and now.	6.399613837091756
9095. overwhelmed with the care of five young children and concerned about	persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income	her defense of denial was excessively strong.	3.728293694774503
9096. thus the lack of effective	recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two	babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem.	6.3234259961731185
9097. the result dramatically	visible in a matter of days in the family's disrupted daily	functioning was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall	the second twin whose birth had not been anticipated.	4.0940016616059225
9098. soon mrs	b's fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning	the welfare of the entire family.	6.818706034275398
9099. inability to care for the other	children difficulty in feeding the babies who seemed colicky bone-weary	fatigue repeated crying episodes and short tempers reflected	the family's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation.	3.86534223963105
9100. clearly	this was a family in crisis.	7.603896187885215
9101. mrs b compared her	feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at	the time of her mother's death when she was eight as well as her subsequent	anger at her father for remarrying.	4.134093104697482
9102. her previous traumatic experiences	flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday.	7.363862828758647
9103. on the anniversary of her father's death she poured out with agonized	tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral.	4.158823725956251
9104. in the family's own words they	had reached the crisis peak- either the situation will give or	we	will break!   direct confrontation and acceptance of mrs	b's anger against the second baby soon dissipated her fears	of annihilation.	4.8303392488591985
9105. abreaction of her anxiety and guilt concerning the	death of her parents when linked up with her current feelings of anger	and her fears of loss abandonment and annihilation produced further	relief of tension.	3.570030604897045
9106. in a joint interview mr and mrs b were	helped to understand the meaning of a younger son's wandering away	from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the	arrival of the twins.	6.036311509704082
9107. the father accurately perceiving the child's	needs not only respected them as worthy of his attention but immediately	satisfied them by taking him on his lap along with the twins	saying i have a big lap; there is room for you too johnnie.	3.6015710948071327
9108. simultaneously a variety of environmental supports- a calm but	not	too motherly homemaker referral for temporary economic aid intelligent	use of nursing care accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical	advice on the twins' feeding problem- combined to prevent further	development of predictable pathological mechanisms.	4.769865972940817
9109. follow-up visits	of the nurse and social worker indicated continued success in the	care of the new babies as well as a marked improvement in the family's	day-to-day mental health and social functioning.	4.348441367094314
9110. as seen	in the b family there must be an attempt to help the client develop	conscious awareness of the problem especially in the absence of a	formal request for assistance.	6.986140052845859
9111. the lack of awareness usually springs	from deep but disguised anxiety often assuming the superficial guise	of not knowing or not caring.	3.9183075420218025
9112. the unhealthy use of denial	in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium	of a positive controlled transference.	4.909413046003364
9113. in general the approach is	more active than passive more out-reaching than reflective.	5.03712926943698
9114. while some	regression is inevitable it is discouraged rather than encouraged	so that the transference does not follow the stages of planned regression	associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic	model for insight therapy.	4.921856710707761
9115. to establish an emotionally meaningful	relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential helpfulness	immediately preferably within the first interview by meeting	the client's specific needs.	3.977821522320952
9116. these needs usually concern the reduction	of guilt and some relief of tension.	6.242131469445269
9117. the initial interview must	be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an information-seeking	sense.	4.012553355630973
9118. in this relationship-building stage the worker must communicate	confidence in the client's ability to deal with the problem.	6.610673745751884
9119. in	so doing he implicitly offers the positive contagion of hope as a kind	of maturational dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness	generally associated with the first stages of stress impact.	3.9299082753051904
9120. thus the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive	efforts on his own behalf.	6.804566306632
9121. here there is a specific preventive component	which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation.	5.404813321844953
9122. we are preventing or averting pathogenic phenomena such as undue	regression unhealthy suppression and repression excessive use of	denial and crippling guilt turned against the self.	5.3937854540584365
9123. while some suppression	and some denial are not only necessary but healthy the worker's	clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used	what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated and when	efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively timed.	3.5540642565033944
9124. in steering the family toward ego-adaptive and away from maladaptive	responses the worker uses time-honored focused casework techniques	of specific emotional support clarification and anticipatory guidance.	5.080079763494645
9125. over a relatively short period of time usually about four to twelve	weeks the worker must be able to shift the focus back and forth	between immediate external stressful exigencies	and the key emotionally relevant issues	which are often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough reactivated	by the crisis situation and hence once again amenable to resolution.	3.6666886482419594
9126. though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques they	do challenge the worker's skill to articulate them precisely on the	spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments.	5.951700261737098
9127. then too the utmost clinical flexibility is necessary in judiciously	combining carefully timed family-oriented home visits single and group	office interviews and appropriate telephone follow-up calls if	the worker is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted unhealthy	outcome is to be actually averted in accordance with the principles	of preventive intervention.	3.9590155910757057
9128. in addition in many cases a variety of	concrete social resources- homemaker day care medical and financial	aid- must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to	bolster the family in its individual and collective coping and integrative	efforts.	5.001333606650236
9129. at certain critical stages and only for sound diagnostic	reasons it may be important to accompany family members in their use	of these resources if their problem-solving behavior is to be constructive	rather than defeating.	4.202698029309344
9130. while expensive in time and involving	a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker	willingness to leave the sanctity of his office and enter actively into	techniques of accompaniment were found to be of	tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives.	5.609986834138077
9131. finally whatever the techniques used a twin goal is common to all	preventive casework service: to cushion or reduce the force of the	stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family	members to mobilize and use their ego capacities.	3.992707083945967
9132. having outlined	an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework we	now address ourselves to our final question: what place should brief	crisis-oriented preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of	services?	5.239856569699982
9133.  we should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy	of values locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term	intensive service at the top instead of seeing the services as part	of a continuum each important in its own right.	4.065728176765892
9134. this problem is perhaps	as old as social casework itself.	6.955826337463657
9135. almost three decades ago bertha	reynolds undertook a study of short-contact interviewing because of	her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected	place in our network of social services.	3.828594801028171
9136. her conclusion has been borne	out in the experience of many practitioners: h short-contact	interviewing is neither a truncated nor a telescoped experience but	is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work.	5.4358429162114605
9137. thus	casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be	regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the	quantity of time expended.	4.4858165272525925
9138. that we are experiencing an upsurge	of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of	brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling	of current literature.	5.728042441843345
9139. especially noteworthy is levinger's finding	that the length of treatment per se is not a reliable indicator of	successful outcome.	5.05403736322192
9140. according to a number of studies the important	predictors are the nature and management of the client's anxiety as	well as the accessibility of the helping person.	6.316686738667231
9141. for example the level	of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of	immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problems compared favorably	with the results reported by typical child guidance clinics where	the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the	number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental	project.	3.5487709986249865
9142. of startling significance too is the assertion that	it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent attrition	rate as compared with a rate of 59 percent reported for a comparable	group of families who were receiving help in traditionally operated	child guidance services.	5.069267120231708
9143. these reports refer to a level of secondary	prevention in a child guidance clinic approached by the customary route	of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people.	3.8547265985074683
9144. similarities to the approach which i have described are evident in	the prompt establishment of a helping relationship quick appraisal of	key issues and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the	essential dynamics in helping to further the ego's coping efforts in	dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses.	4.812966658090606
9145. while there	are many different possibilities for the timing of casework intervention	the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional settings	all point up the importance of an immediate response to the client's	initial need for help.	4.173597601235721
9146. in some programs treatment is concentrated	over a short period of time while in others after the initial	contact is established flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally	used with apparent success.	5.330860021380479
9147. willingness to take the risk of	early and direct interpretation	is another prominent	feature in these efforts.	4.832300725985777
9148. my aim in mentioning this factor obviously	is not to give license to wild therapy but rather to encourage	us to use the time-honored clinical casework skills we already possess	and to use them with greater confidence precision and professional	pride.	5.044482875346966
9149. though there is obviously great need for continued	experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further	efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at	the secondary- or perhaps in some instances primary- level the	place of short-term intervention has already been documented by a number	of investigators in a wide variety of settings.	3.813162751671681
9150. woodward for example	has emphasized the need for a broad spectrum of services including	very brief services in connection with critical situations.	6.307658372147986
9151. ideally	brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice	rather	than as a treatment of chance.	4.060235568763422
9152. moreover the shortage of treatment	resources and the chronically persistent shortage of mental health manpower	force us to innovate additional refinements of preventive intervention	techniques to make services more widely available- and on a	more effective basis to more people.	4.9056428889910295
9153. further research in the meaning	of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework	services- including attempts to develop a typology of family structures	crisis problems reaction mechanisms and differential treatment	approaches- and the establishment of new experimental programs are	imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers	in collaboration with community planners.	3.5426538255212745
9154. our literature	is already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive	agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the	globally utopian.	5.602711438603816
9155. probably in the immediate future we will have to	settle for middle-range efforts that fall short of utopian models.	4.411235308353081
9156. increased	experimentation with multipurpose agencies especially those	that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child welfare	services holds rich promise for the future.	5.051766433984403
9157. for example child welfare	experience abounds with cases in which the parental request for	substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is meaningfully	linked with a fundamental unresolved problem of family relationships.	4.103071873747976
9158. tension management and communication of sentiment	are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment	or feeling.	5.885215140950714
9159. one of the devices for tension management is preferential	mating.	5.896104442595052
9160. the preferential mating of this particular population	has been analyzed in a separate study.	5.398765640377011
9161. the relative geographical isolation	of the brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating.	3.9935911302161977
9162. it would seem necessary that members of this population provide support	for one another since it is not provided by the larger society.	7.1403182418399975
9163. the	supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and	social isolation.	4.681571082223364
9164. the newlyweds building homes on the same land with	either set of parents and the almost exclusive use of members of the	population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive	relationship.	5.078624899114297
9165. as loomis remarks in the internal pattern	the chief reason for interacting is to communicate liking friendship	and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another	and corresponding negative sentiments to those who stand in antagonistic	relations.	3.7868730714528054
9166. maintenance of the status	quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population	today.	7.3415162967965495
9167. yet the object of the element of achieving through the	process of goal attaining for this population appears to have been changed	by circumstances brought about by the war.	4.402816892357371
9168. prior to world war	2 there was a higher percentage of endogamous marriages than after	world war 2.	6.480881475648193
9169. the norms as elements refer	to all criteria for judging the character or conduct of both individual	and group actions in any social system.	3.5473748551672966
9170. the process of evaluation	assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements.	6.067824799181713
9171. the elements and processes become evident in a study of mate	selection in this population.	4.229164941255479
9172. from the evidence it may be conjectured	that core-core marriages are the preferred unions for core males and	females; core-marginal marriages still belong in the category of	permissive unions; and core-negro marriages are proscribed for core	members.	5.331818774286162
9173. the element of status-roles and associated	processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population	to permit any type of conjectures about them.	3.884868188918348
9174. there is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members	of the population that the element of power primarily the voluntary	influence of non-authoritative power has been exerted on actors in	the system particularly in regard to mate selection.	5.337165153235136
9175. this would seem	to vary from family to family depending somewhat on the core or marginal	status of that family.	4.315933375643076
9176. again size of the group may have	some influence on the strength of group controls.	8.515680990019264
9177. interviews	with members of the brandywine population were attempted in	order	to discover the ranking of the various families in the population.	4.564589483427425
9178. the large majority of the interviewees placed core families in the	upper positions.	6.260164429377831
9179. loomis considers ranking a product of the evaluation	process.	5.759074605683444
9180. the standing or rank of an actor in a given social system	is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in	accordance with the norms and standards of the system.	4.94879764580893
9181. despite the	increasing rate of exogamous marriages the population has been able	to sustain at least to some degree the consciousness of its intermediate	status in society.	4.135718316452961
9182. to some extent the system can be considered	a gemeinschaft in which social-role occupancies are determined	by birth by attributes such as sex or caste which are biologically	or socially immutable.	5.248562352257738
9183. the adherence of many in the population to	the indian background in their pedigree and emphasis upon the fact	that their ancestors had never been slaves becomes of prime interest	in	determining how far these elements promote the self-image of the intermediate	status of the group in society.	3.444987122134829
9184. the negative	sanctions applied to core-negro marriages for core members act as	indicators of expected adherence to group norms.	4.994484465085144
9185. however because of	church laws lately more stringently enforced which forbid the marriage	of cousins closely related consanguineously a means of facilitating	the goal of in-group relations may be that of recourse to illegitimate	unions.	3.9697784356417123
9186. a cursory survey of available material indicates a high	rate of illegitimate births occurring to parents who have a close consanguineous	relationship.	5.130892137311206
9187. the comprehensive or master	processes activate all or some of the elements within the social system	and subsystems.	4.428336399497846
9188. within the larger social system are the structural	and functional subsystems.	7.693993896284003
9189. the structural subsystem consisting of	relatively stable inter-relationships among its parts includes:	subgroups of various types interconnected by relational norms.	3.710755171679509
9190. roles of various types within the larger system and within	the subgroups h  regulative norms governing subgroups and	roles.	5.538901043187164
9191. in the study of marriage	patterns for this group consanguinity produces the structural system-	a system of affinities- which in turn maintains the system of	consanguinity.	4.333006201540889
9192. subgroups of various types have been found within this	system.	7.158070988320716
9193. each family line can be considered a substructure.	6.301976493257993
9194. there seems	to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status	within the group.	7.490509477225947
9195. additionally the proscription of core-negro marriages	for core families discussed above would seem to act as a regulative	norm governing subgroups and roles.	4.291501663918642
9196. the scope of this study does	not provide for the study of roles of various types within the larger	system or within the subgroups.	5.536855179351756
9197. however it cannot be presumed informal	though the structure of the population seems that there are not	well-defined roles within the system.	5.439963545792221
9198. the present study relates	to the theory of functional systems.	7.203195618665451
9199. it is hypothesized that fertility	is a function of the social system when the population as a whole	is considered and a function of the subsystems when the two-fold division	of core families and marginal families is considered.	3.7932229455864017
9200. the four	functional problems of a social system are to some extent solved by	the subsystems within this population.	5.20231115954611
9201. by means of geographical isolation	and high fertility rates inbreeding can be fostered and the pattern	of isolation from the greater society maintained.	4.350538488719384
9202. in order to attain	the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension the high fertility	rate provides more group members for mate selection and the clustering	of members in groups fosters acceptance of group controls.	5.0749334741610586
9203. to	maintain their intermediate position in the larger society it is not	only necessary that members of this population be visible but	that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate distinct	grouping or system in society.	3.787033645151271
9204. as mentioned above where families	are concentrated in larger numbers group controls seem strongest and	most effective.	6.00841409160081
9205. adaptation to the social and non-social environment	through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of occupational	segregation.	4.175458885134946
9206. this provides the necessary contact with the larger	society while supporting a type of control over members in terms	of social contacts.	5.6059493382688785
9207. integration has to do with the inter-relation	of parts.	6.6981945098552895
9208. the problem of solidarity and morale again involves	the concept of values.	6.766383365648476
9209. the values placed by the brandywine population	upon maintaining a certain homogeneity a certain separate racial	identity and therefore a certain separate social status are important	for the morale of the system.	3.4424568323300933
9210. since morale is closely related to	pattern maintenance and integration the higher the morale and solidarity	the better the system can solve the problems of the system.	5.685006894073456
9211. in this	respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between	the brandywine population and the white and negro populations within	the same general locality the greater the possibility for higher morale	and solidarity within the brandywine population.	3.846494442032678
9212. it is conceived	that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical	and social isolation.	7.532609381993291
9213. in turn higher fertility rates for this population	provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the	population allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity.	4.370079085813461
9214. the population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger.	5.642803662039175
9215. of particular utility in the analysis of the	development persistence and change of social systems has been the	use of the master or comprehensive processes.	4.074717198241315
9216. loomis considers six such	processes in his paradigm.	7.1581511048922275
9217. boundary	maintenance   3.	8.815314306294878
9218. social control   6.	11.170358616147213
9219. institutionalization though undoubtedly	all six processes are operative within the whole social system	and its subsystems two processes that are of crucial importance to	this study will be singled out for particular emphasis:	in discussing the process of communication loomis defines	it as the process by which information decisions and directives	are transmitted among actors and the ways in which knowledge opinions	and attitudes are formed or modified by interaction.	3.4939498861452245
9220. communication	may be facilitated by means of the high visibility within the larger	community.	7.199518608225492
9221. intense interaction is easier where segregated living and	occupational segregation mark off a group from the rest of the community	as in the case of this population.	4.407038187875676
9222. however the factor of physical	isolation is not a static situation.	9.007796773826866
9223. although the brandywine population	is still predominantly rural there are indications of a consistent	and a statistically significant trend away from the older and	relatively isolated rural communities h urbanization appears to be	an important factor in the disintegration of this group.	3.94720700573236
9224. this conclusion	is however an over-simplification.	8.50843436079714
9225. a more realistic analysis must	take into account the fact that brandywine people in the urban-fringe	area are in general less segregated locally than group members	in rural areas.	4.3871807713950774
9226. in the urban area in other words they unlike some	urban ethnic groups do not concentrate in ghetto colonies.	6.1394290122027195
9227. group pressures	toward conformity are slight or non-existent and deviant behavior	in mate selection incurs few if any social sanctions.	4.117627791426074
9228. in such a setting	social contacts and associations are likely to be heterogamous	resulting in a change of values and almost necessarily in mate selection	behavior.	6.562522606361112
9229. to the extent that urban life contributes to the breakdown	of the group patterns of residential isolation to that extent it	contributes directly to increased exogamy.	4.201191706722009
9230. the process of social control is operative insofar as sanctions play	a part in the individual's behavior as well as the group's behavior.	6.584038009431763
9231. by means of this social control deviance is either eliminated	or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group.	4.898742404916974
9232. examples	from this population indicate that deviance seems to be sanctioned	by ostracism from the group.	6.430943098479017
9233. there is an oral	tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin	and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society.	5.722030768137811
9234. confused and divided though this tradition may be it is an important	part of the social and cultural heritage of the group and acts as a	means of socialization particularly for members of the rural community.	6.25932689345008
9235. the fact of indian ancestry and free status during the days	of slavery are important distinctions made by members of the group.	4.466529055080324
9236. culturally induced social cohesion resulting	from common norms and values internalized by members of the group	is operative in the boundary maintenance of the group as well	as in the process of socialization.	5.902905549218936
9237. the process of boundary maintenance	identifies and preserves the social system or subsystems and the characteristic	interaction is maintained.	4.154706594874521
9238. as the threat of encroachment	on the system increases the probability of applied boundary maintenance	mechanisms increases.	6.844328887687467
9239. the fertility rate pattern would	seem to be a function though a latent one of the process of maintaining	the boundary.	5.054044086874753
9240. increased boundary maintenance may be achieved	for example by assigning a higher primacy or evaluation to activities	characteristic of the external pattern h the external pattern	or external system can be considered as group behavior that enables	the group to survive in its environment h boundary maintenance	for	this group would seem to be primarily social as is the preference	for endogamy.	4.770488656191288
9241. it is also expressed in the proscription against deviants	in the matter of endogamy particularly in rural areas.	5.192150853971305
9242. by their	pattern of endogamy and exogamy the core families and the marginal families	show distinct limits to the intergroup contact they maintain.	5.375110409887745
9243. where boundary maintenance describes the boundaries	or limits of the group systemic linkage is defined as the	process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems	is articulated in such a manner that the two systems in some ways	and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit.	4.467471542463989
9244. a royal decree issued in 1910 two years after the belgian government	assumed authority for the administration of the congo prescribed	the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms.	5.243674302685534
9245. further decrees	along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919.	5.222690638719159
9246. in 1922 a continuous	registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance	of the governor-general and the periodic compilation of these	records was ordered.	5.467634888900497
9247. but specific procedures for carrying out this	plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors.	4.377757829950609
9248. a unified	set of regulations applicable to all areas was issued in 1929 and	a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was	instituted at the same time.	5.486114901975748
9249. the whole system was again reviewed and	reorganized in 1933.	4.929038713633751
9250. general responsibility for its administration rested	with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor	supply and native affairs service des affaires indigenes et de la	main-d'oeuvre	.	5.222945869890492
9251. tribal authorities the chiefs and their	secretaries were held responsible for maintaining the registers of	indigenous persons within their territories under the general supervision	of district officials.	3.763055243319217
9252. the district officials along with their	other duties were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in	selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic	statistics.	4.773613801816857
9253. the regulations require the inscription of each	individual.	4.641934589711508
9254. the cards filed by circonscription	are kept in the headquarters of each territoire.	6.051179890965926
9255. each	card is expected to show certain information about the individual	concerned including his or her date of birth	spouses and children.	4.660991292850732
9256. additional entries must be made from time	to time.	7.185984051683782
9257. different cards are used for males and females and a corner	is clipped from the cards of adults and of children when they reach	puberty.	3.855213061512588
9258. so a quick count could be made at any time even by an illiterate	clerk of the number of registered persons in four age-and-sex	classes.	6.512333877730692
9259. personal identification cards are issued to all adult males	on which tax payments inoculations periods of employment and changes	of residence are recorded.	3.7992019768996257
9260. similar identification cards were issued	in 1959 to all adult females.	6.5977178616414776
9261. each adult is held personally responsible	for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card	which must be shown on demand.	4.121408172524624
9262. the registration card of a person leaving	his home territory for a short period is put into a special file	for absent persons.	5.116325881267807
9263. the cards of permanent out-migrants are in theory	sent to an office in the place of new residence.	4.0977453909070665
9264. finally the registration	of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory	in most regions.	6.142455078643127
9265. numbers of registered persons in four age-and-sex	classes were counted each year.	4.535752126583474
9266. in addition demographic inquiries	supposedly involving field investigations were conducted in selected	minor divisions containing about 3 percent	of the total population.	5.7853406786503285
9267. the results of these inquiries were used to	adjust compilations of data from the registers and to provide various	ratios and rates by districts including birth and death rates general	fertility rates distributions by marital status fertility of wives	separately in polygynous and non-polygynous households infant mortality	and migration.	3.4502786740220346
9268. the areas to be examined in these inquiries were	selected by local officials supposedly as representative of a larger	population.	5.049586378133576
9269. averages of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas	were applied to the larger population.	5.005987191420967
9270. the scheme in theory	is an ingenious adaptation of european registration systems to the conditions	of african life.	5.055787337054696
9271. but it places a severe strain on the administrative	resources of a widely dispersed	poor and largely illiterate population.	4.542894217432549
9272. the sampling program was	instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely	recognized in population studies.	5.4063368288019
9273. the system was not well adapted to	conditions of life in urban centers.	5.0000922842031965
9274. the distinction between domiciled	and present population was not clearly	defined.	6.008436947955877
9275. so the results are subject to considerable confusion.	6.281135735773516
9276. the	system tended to break down during the war but was reactivated; it	had reached the pre-war level of efficiency by 1951.	5.491279550149115
9277. in spite of the	defects in this system the figures on total population during the late	1930's and again in the early 1950's seem to have represented actual	conditions in most districts with approximate fidelity.	4.377052231519878
9278. but the	information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading.	6.4861208291920995
9279. the same system with minor modifications was developed in ruanda-urundi	under belgian administration.	4.493822854468988
9280. here again it seems that	useful approximations of the size and geographical distribution of the	population were obtained in this way in the late pre-war and early post-war	periods.	6.6705025052296545
9281. before considering more recent activities we	should note another important aspect of demography in belgian africa.	4.5541856220488555
9282. a number of strong independent agencies established in some cases	with governmental or royal support have conducted large medical social	educational and research operations in particular parts of the congo	and ruanda-urundi.	5.519207771905274
9283. the work of fonds reine elisabeth pour l'assistance	medicale aux indigenes du congo belge	has special interest with respect to demography.	4.55065636719909
9284. this agency accepted	responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from	638560 persons in 1941 to 840503 in 1956 in the kwango district	and adjacent areas east of leopoldville.	4.902336281031674
9285. each year from 1941 on its	medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine	changes in population structure and vital rates and as its primary	objective the incidence of major diseases.	3.846592046059356
9286. its findings are reported	each year in its rapport sur l'activite pendant annee h.	6.24112971061171
9287. somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical	officers in other areas.	5.0517587822199905
9288. other independent or partially independent	agencies have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly	related to demography.	5.9424629014444825
9289. these studies vary widely in scope and precision.	5.42963474211212
9290. l'institut pour la recherche scientifique en afrique centrale	has sponsored well-designed field investigations and has	cooperated closely with the government of ruanda-urundi in the development	of its official statistics.	5.006399780259671
9291. a massive investigation	of the characteristics of in-migrants and prospective out-migrants in	ruanda-urundi is being carried on by j j maquet former director	of the social science branch of irsac now a professor	at l'universite officielle du congo belge et du ruanda-urundi.	3.4004605394665304
9292. some 30000 completed schedules with 20 items	have been tabulated.	7.077312462741995
9293. the results are	now being analyzed.	5.46167266241957
9294. statistics have been recognized as a matter	of strategic importance in the congo and in ruanda-urundi during	the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs.	5.826982934433779
9295. the aimo organizations of both countries which maintain	administrative services throughout the territories retained immediate	responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information.	3.5745628042219035
9296. however the statistical offices of both governments were	assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics.	6.468160200639316
9297. a bureau de la demographie was formed	under aimo in the congo to work in close rapport with the	section statistique of the secretariat general.	4.275187517556562
9298. eventually responsibility	for demographic inquiries in the congo was transferred to	the demographic division of the central statistical office.	6.6236650659832215
9299. the 1952	demographic inquiry in ruanda-urundi was directed by v neesen	a member of the irsac staff though the inquiry was carried	out under the auspices of aimo which has continuing responsibility	for demographic statistics in this territory.	3.8066419128670184
9300. a member of the	irsac staff was recently delegated to cooperate	with aimo in the development of demographic statistics	in this territory.	6.490625097798511
9301. the initiation of sampling censuses in ruanda-urundi	and in the congo were major advances.	4.491553117358486
9302. we	will deal first with the program in the congo though this was put into	operation later than the other.	6.026190464779844
9303. the radical nature of the	innovation in the congo was not emphasized in the official announcements.	4.210762679254254
9304. the term enquetes demographiques previously used for the supplementary	investigations carried out in connection with the administrative	censuses was used for the new investigations.	6.831876956859783
9305. however the differences	field operations were transferred from	administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially	trained teams	of full-time african investigators	.	4.324961997106724
9306. these teams carried out the same operations	successively in different areas.	6.93456731815161
9307. sample	areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application	of the principles of probability theory so as to be representative	of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits.	4.246515959222965
9308. in short scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective	sampling.	7.695437384055787
9309. the populations of the various districts or other major divisions	were stratified by type of community and	where appropriate by ethnic affiliation and by type of economy.	3.591180682391847
9310. sample	units were drawn systematically	within these strata.	7.603896187885215
9311. different	sampling ratios were applied under different conditions.	5.3285636594893
9312. higher	proportions were sampled in urban and mixed communities than in rural	areas.	6.093123995732186
9313. about 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new	investigation as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries.	4.74616125118612
9314. uniform questions definitions	and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country.	6.514061772105443
9315. data	were obtained separately on three classes of persons: residents	present; visitors.	4.681571082223364
9316. in the	reports summary results are given for both the de facto	and de jure populations; but the subsequent analysis	of characteristics is reported only for the de jure population	.	5.192655756546096
9317. these	changes represent in effect a shift from an administrative compilation	of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve	political and economic objectives to a systematic sampling census	of the whole african population.	3.541081760441852
9318. the population registration	system still has important functions.	6.235502562047283
9319. it supplies local data which are	useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive	studies in particular situations.	5.333940495696552
9320. it provides a frame for the sampling	census.	9.618469513186627
9321. it also provides a frame within which the registration	of vital events is gradually gaining force	obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the congo from this	.	4.555011077244372
9322. it is still used in making current population	estimates in post-census years though the value of these estimates	is open to question.	6.727457899878345
9323. finally it may have certain very important	less obvious values.	5.868682488315122
9324. even though the registers may have an incomplete	record of persons present in a particular area or include persons	no longer living there they contain precise information on ages by date	of birth for some of the persons present	and supplementary information	for many others.	5.526030852924829
9325. the quality of the census	data can therefore be greatly improved by the use of the registration	records in conjunction with the field inquiries.	4.835833867807278
9326. furthermore it may	be possible to estimate the error due to bias in method	in each of these sources on such subjects	as fertility mortality and migration during a given interval by using	information from two largely independent sources in conjunction.	4.9465485534989
9327. the first sampling census in the congo extended over a three-year	period 1955-57; the results were still being processed in 1959.	4.314861116897903
9328. it is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved	equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 so that the inquiry	can be carried through in one year and the results published more	expeditiously.	6.1326409569610325
9329. it is proposed that in the future complete sampling censuses	be carried out at five-year intervals.	5.698969795642148
9330. reports already	issued on the sampling census 1955-57 in various areas run as follows	:	.	5.841790665534768
9331. this report contains preliminary notes and 35 tables.	5.215228988717433
9332. other reports in identical form but with somewhat varying content	have been issued for: .	6.272052074330466
9333. these area reports will be	followed according to present plans by a summary report which will	include a detailed statement on methods.	3.9766173323965965
9334. with this evidence in mind the writer began to plan how he might	more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes.	5.782903222291867
9335. toward the end of the semester's work he interviewed every	married class member at great length.	5.12401616930141
9336. he found as he had suspected	a	general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed	course was not really functional for these students.	6.383737991604187
9337. however	all admitted that the hind sight was not altogether lost.	4.681571082223364
9338. in their	own words it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they	had gotten into their marriages and perhaps they had obtained some	insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time.	5.17524401884197
9339. in fact	they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design	a section exclusively for married students there should be at	the beginning some hind sight study; but they all hastened to	add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent.	3.8253878627530487
9340. all of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could	be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course.	5.917904429638912
9341. a few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section	for married students.	4.897726979812233
9342. as one of them expressed it it has done me	a world of good to listen to the nai^ve questions and comments of	these not-yet-married people.	6.04416387900044
9343. i can now better see just what processes	provoked certain actions from me in the past.	4.677310219430841
9344. had i been in an all-married	section i would have missed this and i believe that this single	aspect has been of great personal value to me.	5.916496123932586
9345. this comment	and others similar to it would seem to indicate a possible justification	for continuing the status quo.	4.67152815281196
9346. but the weight of feeling was heavily	in the opposite direction.	7.758359005379878
9347. thus the writer decided to hold one experimental	section of the functional preparation for marriage course	in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already married-	that is prerequisite: marriage.	3.8655949998259813
9348. this did not mean that married	students could not enroll in other mixed sections and some	of them largely because of scheduling difficulties did.	6.042519396720431
9349. but only	those already married could enroll in this one section.	5.358947737754736
9350. in addition	the regular sections do not allow freshmen; this one did.	6.370453158772714
9351. this action	was rationalized on the basis of a small survey which indicated that	a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become	sophomores.	4.472561898689536
9352. many of them appear to drop out for one reason or another.	7.444852371501105
9353. by permitting freshman students we might extend the opportunity	for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get	auditors were encouraged.	3.9526768772697554
9354. in the regular sections they have always	been more or less discouraged.	7.789317234635936
9355. the philosophy has been that if they could	find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit	and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively.	4.129556979947239
9356. besides auditors do not count on faculty load with the same weight	as regularly enrolled students.	6.461303736947454
9357. but in this one section we welcomed	auditors.	7.664627531684301
9358. why?	14.778306436938408
9359.  for no particular reason other than that the writer	felt it might- just might- encourage both mates to be in attendance.	4.506911043873357
9360. many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum especially	in the various engineering fields with few electives till the senior	year.	6.12883685769414
9361. incidentally it needs to be noted that because auditors were	permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week until	at last it swelled to such proportions that this free auditing	policy had to be retracted.	4.071659539523381
9362. after that we began to get visitors	to class.	8.426447334091591
9363. this experimental class represented quite a variety	of students.	5.2156502263719835
9364. it ranged from a freshman woman just married through	the various academic growth stages including one senior-graduate student	to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also	attended.	5.020719342158409
9365. it ranged from those with no children through students	in various stages of pregnancy to one 44-year-old male with four children	three of whom were teenagers.	4.1555717206557405
9366. it ranged from two women members	who had experienced premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married	and seemingly unable to conceive.	5.512965700878805
9367. one might digress at	this point and speculate that if it is wise to create special sections	for special status then why not a special section for women pregnant	before marriage and one for 44-year-old men with teenage children	and so on.	3.9708720335283214
9368. some of these speculations may have some merit others	are somewhat ambiguous.	8.081727813412112
9369. but few who have experienced marriage can dispute	the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different	in marriage than in a pre-marital situation.	4.364350409831644
9370. the writer	began this special class by explaining his background thinking for	creating such a section in the first place.	5.6716141511463745
9371. he made it clear from the	beginning that this was the students' opportunity and that the future	destiny of such groups depended on favorable results from this one.	4.570152625016841
9372. he did build a framework of academic respectability and one	which did not encroach upon the sacred sovereignty of any other	existing campus course.	5.555617157116494
9373. this is to say that this was not a course	in wise buying or money spending methods nor a course in how to raise	children.	5.909210095760179
9374. we already have courses covering those problems and so on.	6.868570825505423
9375. but within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible.	4.677620179834336
9376. a steering committee of students was organized on the first day	whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and re-evaluate	the direction and pace the class was taking.	5.710398283580098
9377. the writer being	cognizant through his interviews of the reactions of previous married	students did insist on there being included some hind sight material.	3.547336991885156
9378. but the greater part of semester time was actually centered around	the attitudes so we are married- now how do we make the best	of it?	5.613054254365186
9379.  or how do we enrich our already fine marriage?	5.964812292946776
9380. 	films were used as with all sections but with one big difference.	5.926734816808145
9381. our campus unfortunately owns no films.	6.380098669667498
9382. since they are all	either rented or borrowed the requested dates for their use have to	be far in advance.	5.827341947364971
9383. the writer never knew from week to week just where	the section might be.	3.9377139323505292
9384. for example the steering committee might announce	that the group felt a topic under study should not be dropped for	an additional week as there was still too much of it untouched.	6.044247914171341
9385. since	the writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning	he had to go along with their decision- after of course pointing	out	whether he thought their decision was a wise or an unwise one.	3.8280658533723386
9386. thus the	films seen as they came in	were often out of context.	6.75588764732232
9387. nevertheless the writer has never experienced	such spontaneity of discussion after film showings.	4.853931342455543
9388. though	it did not become known to the writer for some time a nucleus group	had sprung up within the class.	5.949815509669018
9389. they began to meet in the evenings and	carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered	in class.	4.2475138843828315
9390. from a few students this group gradually increased to include	over three-fourths of those officially enrolled in the class and	many outsiders as well.	6.052230080681689
9391. also although only a few of the students were	intimately acquainted with each other in the beginning most reported	that when the semester ended their dearest and closest campus friendships	were with members of that class.	4.671039486096391
9392. in fact they often revamped	their social activities to include class members previously unknown.	6.608095970474309
9393. supplemental outside reading reports were handled just as in the	other sections the major difference being that there was a noticeably	deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group.	4.158115906266425
9394. these students although they might read various articles in popular	magazines more often chose to report on articles found in the journals.	5.81971085792767
9395. in addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles	there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read.	4.599795264395087
9396. whereas	a high per cent of the regular students can be expected to read	other texts which more or less plow the same ground in a little different	direction the married students chose whole books on specific areas	and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest.	5.322700047505254
9397. since	the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered	throughout the various sections previous to this experiment	nor as a matter of fact in those who were continuing in single sections	he can only conclude that there must have been something contagious	within the specific group which caused this to occur.	3.8252925249672436
9398. in the main this course took the following directional high roads:	a great deal of time was spent on processes for solving	marital differences.	5.885452521043937
9399. this was not a search for a magic formula	but rather an examination of basic principles pertaining especially	to all types of communication in marriage.	4.806196352366428
9400. in short it was centered	around learning how to develop a more sensitive empathy.	6.950136538424718
9401. not until	the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further	specific adjustment areas such as sex in-laws religion	these same areas	in relation to their own future family life stages developing these	to the extent of examining various crises which could be expected to	confront them at some time or other.	3.8597506523037057
9402. as an example of this last	facet there were some lengthy discussions centered around bereavement.	8.1129622881112
9403. mainly these were concerned with the possibility of the death of	one parent and the complication of living with the survivor afterward	but the possible death of one's own spouse was not overlooked.	4.051970291601735
9404. since	the course one member has lost her husband.	7.462986363725124
9405. this was not a particularly	shocking or unexpected thing- it was previously known to her	that it might happen.	5.1099108842358865
9406. but just when was an unknown and of course the	longer it did not happen the stronger her wish and belief that it might	not.	5.466954692107344
9407. since her bereavement this individual has reported to the writer	on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were	to her in this adjustment crisis.	4.152472326830858
9408. quite frequently class members	brought questions from their mates at home.	6.80302731311465
9409. these were often carefully	written out with a great deal of thought behind them.	6.133644747027396
9410. this added	a personal zest to class discussions and participation.	6.6993653757925555
9411. both	sexes reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage	were extremely enlightening.	4.570025919333818
9412. the writer sensed a much freer and more	frank discussion especially of this one area than ever before.	4.994418463351618
9413. he	felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men	in the class understood that orgasm as a criterion is not nearly so	essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might	think.	3.852570628680156
9414. this was probably much more meaningful because all the women	in the class emphasized it time and again.	5.9188245069498455
9415. on the other hand the	women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than	have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males	as a group to view sex as sex rather than always associating it with	love as most women seem to do.	3.9167154132773665
9416. in the reproductive area it could	be readily observed that all felt freer to discuss things than students	had previously in mixed marital status sections.	5.222489945757462
9417. perhaps this	was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent.	5.765270998225767
9418. never	in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth	discussions about the feelings of both spouses during various	stages of pregnancy.	5.284366247885049
9419. there was a particularly marvelous opportunity	for study in this area since almost every stage of pregnancy was represented	from a childless couple to and including every trimester.	4.329788211037691
9420. in fact we had one birth before the end of the course and another student	had to take the final examiantion a week early just to be on the	safe side.	6.211454172315755
9421. there was also one spontaneous abortion during the semester.	6.234558838625349
9422. thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference	between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief	structuring experience.	6.640941169255597
9423. it was predicted that kohnstamm-negative	subjects would adhere to more liberal concretistic reports	of what the ambiguous figure looked like as reflecting their	hesitancy about taking chances.	3.8924615800929274
9424. this was true mostly of those kohnstamm-negative	subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people	in action.	6.388147442445253
9425. responses such as rope with a loop in it and two	guilford-martin	the three personality inventories	stdcr; guilford-martin gamin; guilford-martin	were filled out by 12 of the kohnstamm-positive	subjects and 19 of the kohnstamm-negative subjects.	3.5904110167546572
9426. these were the	same subjects who were given the rorschach test.	6.885286235796165
9427. some predictions	had been made concerning factors r n i and co on these	inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security	aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as	being of importance in differential kohnstamm reactivity.	3.69180539517118
9428. only	co differentiated between the two groups at less that the 5% level	.	6.787049619536127
9429. one prediction had been made about the difference	in	security or self-confidence between those subjects who shifted their kohnstamm	reactivity when informed and those who did not.	4.3495152140950735
9430. the nonreactors	had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably	secure nonreactors and secure reactors being used	as the groups for comparative personality studies.	4.669145759890817
9431. it was predicted	that those who shifted in their kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly	from those who did not on the factor i which the investigators	refer to as the inferiority factor.	3.9277527548151667
9432. all of the subjects	in the kohnstamm-negative and kohnstamm-positive groups	were compared with those subjects	who shifted in conditions 3 or 4.	6.343750716315812
9433. a t test on these	two groups shifters vs nonshifters gave a t value of 2.	4.101925412870894
9434. 405	which	is significant on the two-tail test at the .	6.522871687113793
9435. individual differences in kohnstamm	reactivity to controlled kohnstamm situations were found among the	subjects used in the study.	4.527200993355437
9436. only 27% gave a positive	kohnstamm reaction when completely nai^ve concerning the phenomenon.	6.619100324978518
9437. there were 49% who did not give a positive reaction	even after they were informed of the normalcy of such a reaction and	had been given a demonstration.	4.633980724320048
9438. there were 24% who	shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were reassured	as to the normalcy of the kohnstamm-positive reaction.	5.554950298174114
9439. among	this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind	of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred.	4.070976796998672
9440. one subject	changed when given only the information that some people have something	happen to their arm when they relax.	5.631508768442101
9441. five subjects did	not change until they had been told that some people have something	happen to their arm what that something was and also were given a	demonstration.	4.174782167721666
9442. four subjects did not change even then but needed	the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances	was a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people showed	while others did not.	4.998552967505875
9443. at no time was it implied by the experimenter	that the subject's initial reaction was deviant.	4.726590575831159
9444. the subjects were	only given information about other possibilities of normal reaction.	5.506908456901043
9445. those who responded with an arm-elevation in the nai^ve state	did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal	people who did not react in this fashion.	4.222935714350229
9446. this information was accepted	with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not	show arm-levitation must be preventing it.	5.376204325152083
9447. these subjects implied that	they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried.	4.4105393661929115
9448. the positive kohnstamm reactivity in condition 1	is not adequately explained by such a concept as suggestibility	.	5.271232733891284
9449. in no way either verbally or behaviorally did the experimenter	indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding to the voluntary	contraction.	3.9882570920146474
9450. moreover when the experimenter did inform those	subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm	rise once they relaxed the kohnstamm-positive subjects were uninfluenced	in their subsequent reactions to the kohnstamm situation.	5.492244296974451
9451. they	continued to give an arm-elevation.	6.2070133904290845
9452. a differential suggestibility would	have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information	to influence the kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute	their nai^ve kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion.	4.856773723660012
9453. autosuggestibility	the reaction of the subject in such a way as to conform to his own	expectations of the outcome	to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction because of his	also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following	reasons: the subjects' apparently genuine experience of surprise	when their arms rose and manifestations of the phenomenon despite	anticipations of something else happening	and maybe falling an expectation spontaneously volunteered by one	.	3.4243013998648504
9454. a suggestion hypothesis also seems inadequate	as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they	were informed of the possibilities of normal reactions different	from those which they gave.	5.285248832744552
9455. while they were told that there were some	normal people who reacted differently than they had they were also informed	that there were other normals who reacted as they had.	3.9697750438025774
9456. there	was no implication made that their initial reaction	was less preferred than the presence of levitation.	6.504981549368137
9457. a more	tenable explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge	and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible	for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax since any reaction	seemed acceptable to the examiner as normal.	3.7312218800722627
9458. the	nai^ve state condition 1 could therefore be viewed as an inhibiting	one for 24% of the subjects in this study.	5.51182508324357
9459. they were not free	to be themselves in this situation an interpersonal one where there	was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable	behavior.	4.333564585429605
9460. instructions to relax ie to be spontaneous	and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have was not sufficiently	reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions	had been given.	5.299999677097512
9461. while other conditions might be even more effective	in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in kohnstamm	reactivity it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would	have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject	which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of	responsibility for his behavior.	3.5390405609413125
9462. alcohol ingestion succeeded in	changing immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject	.	5.7836982265615156
9463. this subject who	has been undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five years did	not give a positive kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardized	conditions used in this experiment while sober.	4.180895858553925
9464. after two drinks	containing alcohol her arm flew upward very freely.	7.010571490749194
9465. there was evident	delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of	the freedom of movement.	5.441571974395961
9466. she described herself as having the same kind	of irresponsible feeling as she had once experienced under hypnosis.	5.7256382957759655
9467. she ascribed her delight with both experiences to the effect	they seemed to have of temporarily removing from her the controls which	she felt so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might	seem appropriate to relax these controls.	3.7824261856362886
9468. many subjects attributed	differences	in kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective	control- voluntary as the kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived	it and involuntary as the kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it.	5.199079129177513
9469. these suggested interpretations were given by the subjects spontaneously	when they were told that there were people who reacted differently	than they had.	4.488958977979769
9470. the kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid	experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no	control.	5.693141571794792
9471. they explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention	of control factors.	5.004399499151638
9472. they felt that they too could counteract	the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced	the reaction.	5.965178587031343
9473. some of those who did not initially react with	an arm-elevation also associated their behavior in the situation with	control factors- an inability to relinquish control voluntarily.	4.7428869339984
9474. one subject spontaneously asked do	you suppose i was unconsciously keeping it down before?	6.268266226065032
9475.  another	said that her arm did not go up at first because i wouldn't	let it; i thought it wasn't supposed to.	3.8973397603544613
9476. this subject was	one	who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the nai^ve state but	not in the first.	5.755462042226293
9477. she had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the	first trial but had consciously prevented it from so doing.	4.346782160354695
9478. she	explained nonreactivity of others by saying that they were not letting	themselves relax.	7.18642471955737
9479. when informed that there were some persons who	did not have their arm go up she commented i don't see how	they can prevent it.	4.119800466139401
9480. in contrast to this voluntary-control explanation	for nonreactivity given by the kohnstamm-positive subjects the	kohnstamm-negative	subjects offered an involuntary-control hypothesis	to explain nonreactivity.	6.029491541011832
9481. they felt that they were relaxing as much as	they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent	response must be on an unconscious level.	4.326939872415173
9482. the above discussion	does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in	abeyance in the kohnstamm-positive subjects; but rather that they could	be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation.	4.843442301240356
9483. one kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested	in the nai^ve condition described her subjective experience as	follows: you feel they're going up and you're on a stage and	it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's	what's supposed to happen.	3.729848235634936
9484. she then described her experience as	one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of	being in which she relinquished control.	5.4064863412114805
9485. however she was able to relax	and yield to the moment.	6.418965319830973
9486. it is our hypothesis that kohnstamm-positive	subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are	kohnstamm-negative subjects; that they can give up their control and	allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors.	5.197391337783625
9487. it is our belief	that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the	kohnstamm-positive	subjects in some of the other experimental situations	to be discussed below.	4.6767829716839096
9488. thus this readiness to relax controls evidenced	in the kohnstamm situation appears to be a more general personality	factor.	7.050858539383448
9489. the kohnstamm-positive subjects	seemed to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible	in the external world.	3.797547272927986
9490. there was a significantly greater number	in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while	a tennis ball resting on it remained stationary on the incline.	5.371347303214799
9491. this	occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going	downhill.	5.051569403988737
9492. they knew that their perceptual experience differed from	objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting	on the aniseikonic lenses.	5.402503100057666
9493. yet they were not so bound by past experience	and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to	be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be.	4.368924392774749
9494. the	change in perceptions by some of the kohnstamm-negative subjects	after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions	suggests that their constriction and guardedness is associated with	their general mode of responding to strange or unknown situations.	5.362264205499843
9495. they	were able to experience at first in terms of past conventionality.	5.720902966109292
9496. when informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions they	were then able to experience the uniqueness of the present.	5.976219302889583
9497. it might	be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong;	that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as threatening	until they are tested and proved otherwise.	3.7980748232566612
9498. while	the interpretations that have been given are inferences only they	gain support from such comments as the following which was made by one	of the kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not on the first trial	perceive the tilt illusion.	5.419222453765478
9499. it would have been desirable for	the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable	being investigated: the degree of structure in teaching method.	4.876768797143061
9500. the	structured schools were in an industrial city with three-family tenement	houses typical of the residential areas but with one rather sizable	section of middle-class homes.	5.278242163497576
9501. the unstructured schools were in	a large suburban community predominantly middle- to upper-middle class	but fringed by an industrial area.	3.6768831473399355
9502. in order to equate the samples	on socioeconomic status we chose schools in both cities on the basis	of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods.	6.130210547452481
9503. school principals and guidance	workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research	team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas.	3.9743809226695106
9504. an objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from	these data.	6.535141610559171
9505. equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from	upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods.	4.336890192442828
9506. individual	differences in maturation and the development of readiness for	learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most	children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school	achievement.	5.328377033886025
9507. therefore third-grade children were chosen as subjects	for this study.	5.2782559032037
9508. for purposes of sample selection only	we obtained group test scores of reading	achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire third-grade	population in each school system.	5.407665078137266
9509. the subjects for this study were	randomly selected from stratified areas of the distribution one-third	as underachievers one-third medium and one-third over-achievers.	3.836981129563018
9510. children whose reading scores were at least one standard deviation	below the regression line of each total third-grade school population	were considered under-achievers for the purposes of sample selection.	5.166552776155094
9511. over-achievers were at least one standard deviation above the regression	line in their school system.	4.701330647987036
9512. the final sample was not significantly	different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement	or intelligence test scores.	5.639770064054249
9513. twenty-four classrooms in twelve unstructured	schools furnished 156 cases 87 boys and 69 girls.	4.305414028832856
9514. eight classrooms	in three structured schools furnished 72 cases 36 boys and 36	girls.	6.186879861503881
9515. administrative restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size	in the structured schools.	4.681571082223364
9516. it was assumed that the sampling	procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables	under investigation.	6.295088547742197
9517. an interview	schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire	were prepared and one parent of each of the sample children was seen	in the home.	4.163457032481588
9518. the parent was asked to describe the child's typical	behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity	to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self	and others irrational conformity to rules orderliness punctuality	and need for certainty.	4.984803642983587
9519. the interviewers were instructed not to suggest	answers and as much as possible to record the parents' actual	words as they described the child's behavior in home situations.	3.8983876137481617
9520. the rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing	the interview records categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity	then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the	case records.	4.592386097640272
9521. final ratings were made on the basis of a point system	which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors	recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that	was deviant from the discovered norms.	3.7105474503589835
9522. children scoring high in compulsivity	were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations	where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards	and expectations or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals.	4.660065591318038
9523. the low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned	about such matters.	4.012599734289162
9524. for instance the following statement was rated	low in compulsivity she's naturally quite neat about things	but it doesn't bother her at all if her room gets messy.	5.404387992911865
9525. but she	cleans it up very well when i remind her.	5.005823933931043
9526. castaneda et al revised the taylor anxiety scale for	use with children.	6.093123995732186
9527. the taylor scale was adapted from the minnesota	multiphastic personality inventory with item selection based upon	clinical definitions of anxiety.	3.771644115244625
9528. there is much research evidence to	validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who	are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees.	6.679217196731841
9529. reliability and validation	work with the children's anxiety scale by castaneda et	al demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with	the adult scale.	3.8865635468820128
9530. although the taylor scale was designed as a group	testing device in this study it was individually administered by psychologically	trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children	in reading the items.	5.112386488732174
9531. the question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with	a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity.	4.417217518157053
9532. the two ratings yield a	correlation of +.	7.257605023372247
9533. 04 which is not significantly different from zero;	therefore we have measured two different characteristics.	4.493265003335689
9534. in theory	compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety and one might expect	a negative association except for the possibility that for many	children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell	the amount of anxiety they suffer.	5.306162029489301
9535. the issue of interaction between	anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later.	4.778219338846015
9536. in the primary grades reading permeates almost every aspect of	school progress and the children's early experiences of success or	failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement	that is relatively enduring throughout the following years.	4.787163369978174
9537. in establishing	criterion measurements it was therefore thought best to broaden	the scope beyond the reading act itself.	4.198063122201366
9538. the predicted interaction	effect should if potent extend its influence over all academic achievement.	5.289832921804139
9539. the stanford achievement test form j was administered	by classroom teachers consisting of a battery of six sub-tests:	paragraph meaning word meaning spelling language arithmetic	computation and arithmetic reasoning.	3.5678014831794886
9540. all of these sub-tests	involve reading except arithmetic computation.	9.577282898934694
9541. scores are stated	in grade-equivalents on a national norm.	5.1236570952501035
9542. the battery median grade-equivalent	was used in data analysis in this study.	5.506908456901043
9543. the wechsler	intelligence scale for children was administered to each sample	third-grade child by a clinical worker.	3.8147175018419692
9544. the relationship of intelligence	test scores to school achievement is a well-established fact	; therefore in the investigation of the present hypothesis	it was necessary to control this factor.	5.440443029845452
9545. the criterion score	used in the statistical analysis is an index of over- or under-achievement.	3.872342767520762
9546. it is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement	test score and the score that would be predicted by the iq.	6.337648595622271
9547. for example on the basis of the regression equation a child with	an iq of 120 in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement	test score of 4.	4.488650133034807
9548. if a child with an iq	of 120 scored 5.	8.641787801665396
9549. 5 in achievement his discrepancy score would be	+.	6.081951736940474
9550. 7 of one year of over-achievement.	8.616581765557761
9551. a child with an	iq of 98 would be expected to earn an achievement test score	of 3.	4.700984719211855
9552. if such a child scored 3.	10.073756711973498
9553. 0 his discrepancy score would be -.	5.3285636594893
9554. 5 of one year of under-achievement.	9.953663084388383
9555. in this manner	the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled allowing	discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting	from other variables.	4.0721327936831635
9556. _test of interaction of compulsivity	tables 1 and 2 present the results of	the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the	descriptive variable.	5.134264856554871
9557. figure 1 portrays the mean achievement scores of	each sub-group graphically.	4.681571082223364
9558. first of all as we had surmised the highly	compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly	better on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured	schools.	6.034195074722398
9559. it can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity	within the structured schools the high compulsive children do	better.	4.9335467489983245
9560. no significant difference was found in achievement between	high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school.	6.013443358522492
9561. the	hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching	method was supported in this case at the .	4.276370661119123
9562. while	we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school	setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured	we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives	within the schools where the whole-word method is used in beginning	reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives.	5.25014648921401
9563. indeed	their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis	although the difference was not significant.	4.131860641767443
9564. we speculate that compulsives	in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of	the lack of systemization in their school setting but that their need	to organize is so intense that they struggle to induce	the phonic rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the	environment.	5.052528388877101
9565. it is interesting to note that medium compulsives	in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores	.	4.578708350998932
9566. possibly their compulsivity was not strong	enough to cause them to build their own structure.	5.704924933834419
9567. our conjecture	is then that regardless of the manner in which school lessons	are taught the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each	lesson that aid him in systematizing his work.	4.116744575197362
9568. when helped by a high	degree of structure in lesson presentation then and only then does	test of interaction of anxiety	the statistical analyses of achievement in	relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the interactions of the	two are presented in tables 3 and 4.	4.745203311801013
9569. figure 2 is a graph of the mean	achievement scores of each group.	4.411891185517149
9570. as predicted the highly anxious children	in the unstructured schools score more poorly than those	in	the structured schools.	5.837571365031551
9571. the interaction effect which is significant	at the .	4.465110340486763
9572. 01 level can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores.	6.838665455731356
9573. while	high anxiety children achieve significantly less well in the	unstructured school than do low anxiety children they appear to do at	least as well as the average in the structured classroom.	4.015821264694166
9574. the	most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement	in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured	schools.	5.689413270532165
9575. according to the theory proposed this is a consequence	of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated	for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment.	4.25909785636548
9576. the	fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is	thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or	under-achievement	these children exhibit.	5.898226978410991
9577. the child with high anxiety may	first direct his anxiety-released energy toward achievement but because	his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and	memorization of complex symbols the child may fail in his initial attempts	to master the problem.	3.416580127900165
9578. failure confirms the threat and the intensity	of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more	difficult so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the	decrement in performance is pronounced.	5.422267382722903
9579. the individual with high	anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task	with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination.	3.547147838981563
9580. but	the symbols he is asked to learn are simple.	6.978151541426302
9581. as shown earlier the	highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple	elements.	4.667469201211027
9582. success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of	discrimination are improved.	6.659886894751392
9583. by the time the child first attacks the	actual problem of reading he is completely familiar and at ease with	all of the elements of words.	4.80993744637295
9584. apparently academic challenge in the structured	setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high	anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state	without becoming confused or panicked.	5.702622074843724
9585. sarason et al	present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test-like	situation and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives	supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher.	3.685420546215793
9586. although the	present study was not a direct replication of their investigations the	results do not confirm their conclusion.	6.378871361745189
9587. observers in the two school	systems studied here judged the teachers in the structured schools	to be more impersonal and demanding while the atmosphere in the	unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting.	3.715179359709187
9588. yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only	in the unstructured school and performed as well or better than average	in the structured setting.	5.404552500151171
9589. analysis means the evaluation of subparts the comparative	ratings of parts the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements.	4.468279098171313
9590. analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding	strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to	eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts.	5.442093756317687
9591. up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms	of individuals.	5.2189111115511615
9592. roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose:	to evaluate procedures regardless of individuals.	6.55022661311875
9593. for example:	a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying.	4.860544455631979
9594. let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones	we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation	and analysis.	5.571754001317639
9595. one should keep in mind that many of the exciting	possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been	used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other	areas.	5.143166477085
9596. the president of a small firm selling restaurant	products had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen	for his business.	6.223222724948401
9597. interviewing checking references training the	salesmen having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive-	and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory	performance was too high.	3.8570150827840775
9598. it was his experience that only one good salesman	was found out of every seven hired- and only one was hired out	of every seven interviewed.	5.60116006507343
9599. roleplaying was offered as a solution-	and the procedure worked as follows: all candidates were invited	to a hotel conference room where the president explained the difficulty	he had and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who	just did not work out.	3.4210831767297694
9600. in place of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires	checking their references interviewing them asking them to	be tried out he told them he would prefer to test them.	5.3329958404119155
9601. each person	was to enter the testing room carrying a suitcase of samples.	5.26770618777313
9602. each salesman	was to read a sheet containing a description of the product.	7.534801050691307
9603. in	the testing room he was to make successively three presentations	to three different people.	5.174876878772072
9604. in the testing room three of the veteran	salesmen served as antagonists.	7.334663401144309
9605. one handled the salesman in a	friendly manner another in a rough manner and the third in a hesitating	manner.	4.394668889274165
9606. each was told to purchase material if he felt like it.	6.662802494804541
9607. the	antagonists came in one at a time and did not see or hear the other	presentations.	4.989731904182336
9608. after each presentation the antagonist wrote his judgment	of the salesmen; and so did the observers consisting of the	president three of his salesmen and a psychologist.	5.280087232288597
9609. ten salesmen	were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon.	5.796303606361578
9610. this procedure	was repeated one day a month for four months.	7.583686433967309
9611. the batting average	of one success out of seven increased to one out of three.	4.24115658475916
9612. the president	of the firm calculating expenses alone felt his costs had dropped	one-half while success in selection had improved over one hundred	per cent.	4.941911761853857
9613. the reason for the value of this procedure was simply	that the applicants were tested at work in different situations	by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen	conducted themselves with different but typical restaurant owners	and managers.	4.066060568238567
9614. they were in a sense tried out in realistic situations.	9.200067417691738
9615. from the point of view of the applicants less time	was wasted in being evaluated- and they got a meal out of it as well	as some insights into their performances.	4.888364737527616
9616. another use of roleplaying	for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in	real life situations without special equipment or special assistants during	the daily course of work.	5.441661646709816
9617. the position of receptionist was	opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other	girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher	prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions.	4.0293258361397974
9618. all applicants were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist.	9.42048601487167
9619. at the end of work one day the personnel man took the applicants	one at a time asked them to sit behind the receptionist's desk	and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to	the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes.	4.89979488785693
9620. each girl was independently tested by the personnel man and	he served not only as the director but as the antagonist and the observer.	5.879107059075077
9621. somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl whom	he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat	mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time did	the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist showing	wit sparkle and aplomb.	3.83807336099242
9622. she was hired and was found to be entirely	satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day.	5.961350900238809
9623. in considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area	since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision	but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen	in dynamic functioning.	3.8102176280763382
9624. some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying	for analysis may help explain the procedure.	6.970826393369029
9625. an engineer	had been made the works manager of a firm supplanting a retired employee	who had been considered outstandingly successful.	4.197709273283732
9626. the engineer had	more than seven years of experience in the firm was well trained was	considered a hard worker was respected by his fellow engineers for	his technical competence and was regarded as a comer.	5.109529840945311
9627. however	he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position.	6.182874053548577
9628. he seemed	to antagonize everyone.	9.53100541324648
9629. turnover rates of personnel went up production	dropped and morale was visibly reduced.	4.411891185517149
9630. despite the fact that he	was regarded as an outstanding engineer he seemed to be a very poor	administrator although no one quite knew what was wrong with him.	7.446662721791791
9631. at	the insistence of his own supervisor- the president of the firm he	enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders.	5.12795802167037
9632. he played	a number of typical situations before observers other supervisors who	kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought	was wrong.	5.475693999189526
9633. entirely concerned with efficiency he was merciless in	criticizing people who made mistakes condemning them to too great an	extent.	3.9394316778493597
9634. he did not really listen to others had little interest in their	ideas and wanted to have his own way- which was the only right	way.	6.682032210884569
9635. the entire group of managers explained in great detail a number	of human relations errors that he made.	3.9384237645248765
9636. one by one these	errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors.	6.409311436321055
9637. he admitted his behavior and defended it.	5.565277496581019
9638. he refused to change	his approach and instead he attacked high and low- the officials for	their not backing him and subordinates for their laxness stupidity	and stubbornness.	5.001739588881975
9639. after the diagnosing he left the course convinced	that it could do him no good.	5.162188961236722
9640. we may say that his problem	was diagnosed but that he refused treatment.	7.263870880903838
9641. the engineer turned works	manager had a particular view of life- and refused to change it.	4.047421028257421
9642. we	may say that his attitude was foolish since he may have been a success	had he learned some human relations skills; or we may say that	his attitude was commendable showing his independence of mind in his	refusal to adjust to the opinions of others.	5.143131283752119
9643. in any case he refused	to accept the implications of the analysis that he needed to be made	over.	4.779806076009434
9644. another case may be given in illustration of a successful	use of analysis and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive	analysis.	5.737785423445898
9645. in a course for supermarket operators a district manager	who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly	successful as a store manager found that in supervising other	managers he was having a difficult time.	3.651648517148363
9646. on playing some typical situations	before a jury of his peers he showed some characteristics rated	as unsatisfactory.	6.038992227535103
9647. he was told he displayed for example a sense	of superiority- and he answered: well i am supposed to know	all the answers aren't i?	4.224025615393718
9648.  he was criticized for his curtness	and abruptness- and he answered: i am not working to become	popular.	6.4147384710230595
9649. on being criticized for his arbitrary behavior- he answered:	i have to make decisions.	4.970231865906777
9650. in short	as frequently happens in analyses the individual feels threatened and	defends himself.	6.179276972815976
9651. however in this case the district manager was led	to see the errors of his ways.	5.670677448266681
9652. the necessary step between diagnosis and	training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms.	5.904294006610731
9653. how this	was accomplished may be described since this sometimes is a crucial	problem.	4.9124883643716295
9654. the director helped tailor-make a check list of the district	manager's errors by asking various observers to write out sentences	commenting on the mistakes they felt he made.	4.996086858939229
9655. these errors were	then collected and written on a blackboard condensing similar ideas.	4.646674038929972
9656. eighteen errors were located and then the director asked each individual	to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the	particular errors.	5.784668573399627
9657. they were asked to vote true if they thought	they had seen him make the error false if they thought he had	not; and cannot say if they were not certain.	4.174496259786594
9658. the manager	sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went	up and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard.	4.875144845172444
9659. no comments	were made during the voting.	6.496368235605577
9660. the results looked as follows: f.	6.889845812922657
9661. the first eight of these eighteen statements which received	at least one-half of the votes were duplicated to form an analysis	checklist for the particular manager and when this particular manager	roleplayed in other situations the members checked any items that appeared.	3.6263907085763583
9662. to prevent the manager from deliberately controlling himself	only during the sessions they were rather lengthy	the situations were imperfectly described to the manager so that	he would not know what to expect new antagonists were brought on the	scene unexpectedly and the antagonists were instructed to deliberately	behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in	a manner for which he had been previously criticized.	4.9169747322345385
9663. after	every session the check marks were totaled up and graphed and in this	way the supervisor's progress was charted.	3.9394316778493597
9664. in life	we learn to play our roles and we freeze into patterns which become	so habitual that we are not really aware of what we do.	5.9480365461840385
9665. we can see	others more clearly than we can see ourselves and others can see us	better than we see ourselves.	4.437408360044618
9666. to learn what we do is the first step	for improvement.	7.6978901630058125
9667. to accept the validity of the judgments of others is	the second step.	5.551967680244899
9668. to want to change is the third step.	8.15140997347829
9669. to practice new	procedures under guided supervision and with constant feedback is the	fourth step.	4.589552729078203
9670. to use these new ways in daily life is the last step.	6.631159245939393
9671. roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to	training.	4.681571082223364
9672. when an evaluative situation is set up and no concern	is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate we say that	roleplaying is used for evaluation.	5.635354365286218
9673. observers can see a person engaged	in spontaneous behavior and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion.	4.161252085715236
9674. this behavior is more veridical- or true than other	testing behavior for some types of evaluation and so can give quick and	accurate estimates of complex functioning.	5.070853695560179
9675. while roleplaying	for testing is not too well understood at the present time it represents	one of the major uses of this procedure.	4.949868682025845
9676. training	the objective of this chapter is to clarify	the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts.	5.603835476123842
9677. in addition the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will	be reviewed.	5.499625213097211
9678. the goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated	rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this	unique training area.	5.33705881357474
9679. the reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying	application from the previous discussion of training are twofold:	spontaneity training theory is unique and relatively new.	3.9529138472318244
9680. it is not easy for the therapist to discern when in the patient's	communicating an introject has appeared and is holding sway.	6.074102962474111
9681. one	learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone- to his voice's	suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one a quality	which sounds somehow artificial or in some instances parrotlike.	3.6240728360657233
9682. the	content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition as	if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove; only seldom is it so	simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom	common to our culture which he has evidently heard over and over	from a parent until he experiences it as part of him.	5.110349963844537
9683. one hebephrenic	woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow	phony experience of pseudo-emotion during which despite her wracking	sobs and streaming cheeks i felt only a cold annoyance with her.	3.756337090043235
9684. eventually such incidents became more sporadic and more sharply demarcated	from her day-after-day behavior and in one particular session	after several minutes of such behavior- which as usual went on	without any accompanying words from her- she asked eagerly did	you see granny?	4.712439386413646
9685.  at first i did not know what she meant; i	thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from	seeing	her grandmother in their distant home-city.	4.4381410484798165
9686. then i realized that	she had been deliberately showing me this time what granny was like;	and when i replied in this spirit she corroborated my hunch.	5.338726580026118
9687. at another phase in the therapy when a pathogenic mother-introject	began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene she muttered	in a low but intense voice to herself i hate that woman inside	me! i could evoke no further elaboration from her about this;	but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room	from me looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory	tone your	father despises you! again i at first misconstrued	this disconcertingly intense communication and i quickly cast	through my mind to account for her being able to speak with such utter	conviction of an opinion held by my father now several years deceased.	3.309916016699004
9688. then i replied coldly if you despise me why don't you	say so directly?	6.648516183671919
9689.  she looked confused at this and i felt sure	it had been a wrong response for me to make.	4.7067588918524095
9690. it then occurred to me to	ask is that what that woman told you?	6.349105412557767
9691.  she clearly agreed	that this had been the case.	6.427080753896314
9692. i realized now that she had been showing	me in what impressed me as being a very accurate way something her	mother had once said to her; it was as if she was showing me one of	the reasons why she hated that woman inside her.	4.895254463185932
9693. what had been an unmanageably	powerful introject was now despite its continuing charge	of energy disconcerting to me sufficiently within control of her ego	that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like.	3.786882433602605
9694. earlier this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety	of introjects that at times when she was in her room alone it would	sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in	the room as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice.	5.0235313186321235
9695. a somewhat	less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine who used to often seclude	herself in her room often sounded through the closed door- as i	would find on passing by between our sessions- for all the world	like two persons a scolding mother and a defensive child.	3.477231082723157
9696. particularly	hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which	the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the	therapist some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself	only poorly aware and the recognition of which as a part of himself	he finds distinctly unwelcome.	5.278631582023682
9697. i have found time and again that	some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part	of a patient rests in the final analysis on this basis; and only	when i can acknowledge this to myself as being indeed an aspect of	my personality does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of	the patient's behavior.	3.8121678515110666
9698. for example one hebephrenic man used to	annoy me month after month by saying whenever i got up to leave and	made my fairly steoreotyped comment that i would be seeing him on the	following day or whenever you're welcome in a notably condescending	fashion- as though it were his due for me to thank him	for the privilege of spending the hour with him and he were thus pointing	up my failure to utter a humbly grateful thank you to him	at the end of each session.	4.951970961999116
9699. eventually it became clear to me partly	with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my	condescension to me somewhat more directly that this man with his	condescending	you're welcome was very accurately personifying	an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own	demeanor over these months on each of these occasions when i had	bid him good-bye with the consoling note each time that the healing	christ would be stooping to dispense this succor to the poor suffered	again on the morrow.	3.4467414002024146
9700. another patient a paranoid woman for many	months infuriated not only me but the ward-personnel and her fellow	patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building	as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met.	5.1732937683374125
9701. this behavior on her part subsided only after i had come to see the	uncomfortably close similarity between on the one hand her arranging	the ventilation of the common living room to her own liking or turning	the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others	and on the other hand my own coming stolidly into her room despite	her persistent and vociferous objections bringing my big easy chair	with me usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred	to keep in a very cold state and plunking myself down in my chair-	in short behaving as if i owned her room.	3.5339446989170993
9702. here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated or reduced	in their communicative expression to some comparatively simple-seeming	verbal or nonverbal statement.	5.963275724252206
9703. one finds for example	that a terse and stereotyped	verbal expression seeming at first to be	a mere hollow convention reveals itself over the months of therapy	as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings and	the most unconventional of meanings.	3.552098127917611
9704. more than anything it is the	therapist's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype	which helps these meanings to become revealed something like a spread-out	deck of cards on sporadic occasions over the passage of the	patient's and his months of work together.	4.949169659482776
9705. one cannot assume of course	that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype	at the beginning of the therapy or at any one time later on when	the stereotype was uttered; probably it is correct to think of it as	a matter of a well-grooved stereotyped mode of expression- and no	or but a few other communicational grooves as yet- being there	available for the patient's use as newly-emerging emotions and	ideas well up in him over the course of months.	3.7525418439355334
9706. but it is true that the	therapist can sense when he hears this stereotype that there are	at this moment many emotional determinants at work in it a blurred babel	of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from	one another.	5.29432003186666
9707. sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype- a	how are you now?	6.926831541718639
9708.  or an i want to go home or whatever-	but a nonverbal one which reveals itself gradually as the condensed	expression of more than one latent meaning.	6.31450691500057
9709. a hebephrenic man used	to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of times during his	largely-silent	hours with his therapist.	4.241511144138369
9710. when the therapist came to feel	on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him what is that	bill- hello or farewell?	5.892919640269328
9711.  the patient replied both dearie-	two in one.	4.886251421296035
9712. of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression	that which seems best to give release and communicational expression	to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter.	5.834972290784974
9713. it is	no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient the most severely dedifferentiated	of all schizophrenic patients shows as one of his characteristic	symptoms laughter- laughter which now makes one feel scorned	or hated which now makes one feel like weeping or which now gives	one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man's despair; and	which more often than all these conveys a welter of feelings which	could in no way be	conveyed by any number of words words which are so	unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another.	3.4691245697695834
9714. to	a much less full extent the hebephrenic person's belching or flatus	has a comparable communicative function; in working with these patients	the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling	over of the possible meaning of a belch or the passage of flatus	not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze	but also because he learns that even these animal-like sounds constitute	forms of communication in which from time to time quite different	things are being said long before the patient can become sufficiently	aware of these as distinct feelings and concepts to say them	in words.	4.43815304199037
9715. as i have been intimating in the schizophrenic-	and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic; this is a question	which i have no wish to take up- condensation is a phenomenon in which	one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas	which are at an unconscious level well sorted out but rather a condensed	expression of feelings and ideas which even in the unconscious	have yet to become well differentiated from one another.	3.7283440414386892
9716. freeman	cameron and mcghie in their description of the disturbances of thinking	found in chronic schizophrenic patients say in regard to condensation	that h the lack of adequate discrimination between the	self and the environment and the objects contained therein h in itself	is the prototypical condensation.	5.096880308395448
9717. in my experience a	great many of the patient's more puzzling verbal communications are	so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated	from figurative meanings in his subjective experience.	4.185369352337986
9718. thus he may	be referring to some concrete thing or incident in his immediate environment	by some symbolic-sounding hyperbolic reference to transcendental	events on the global scene.	5.319971656659983
9719. recently for example a paranoid woman's	large-scale philosophizing in the session about the intrusive	curiosity which has become in her opinion a deplorable characteristic	of mid-twentieth-century human culture developed itself before the	end of the session into a suspicion that i was surreptitiously peeking	at her partially exposed breast as indeed i was.	3.598774750614673
9720. or equally	often a concretistic-seeming particularistic-seeming statement may consist	with its mundane exterior in a form of poetry- may be full	of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression:	a metaphor a smile an allegory or some other symbolic mode of speaking.	5.052925323655561
9721. of such hidden meanings the patient himself is more often	than not entirely unaware.	4.907793198558288
9722. his subjective experience may be a remarkably	concretistic one.	8.416851912998347
9723. one hebephrenic women confided to me i	live in a world of words as if to her words were fully concrete	objects; burnham in his excellent article concerning schizophrenic	communication includes mention of similar clinical material.	4.022157513725853
9724. a borderline schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various	theoretical concepts about which he had been expounding in a most articulate	fashion during session after session with me were like great	cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him; as he	spoke i was reminded of the great bales of cargo which are swung high	in the air from a docked steamship.	5.185143170228826
9725. the many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary	information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's	contents around prefixes stems suffixes etc.	3.9675209984489586
9726. a significant	reduction	in the voume of store information is thus realized especially	for a highly inflected language such as russian.	5.258925197803143
9727. for english the reduction	in size is less striking.	5.52448632359536
9728. this approach requires that:	each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence	between the occurrence and dictionary entries and the information	retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized	into a description of the particular word.	5.154550010946664
9729. the logical scheme used	to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in	the dictionary file.	3.814698927498042
9730. implementation of the latter requires storage of	information needed only for synthesis.	6.96445723381674
9731. we suggest the application	of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem.	5.107518784889501
9732. but first we must define two terms so that their meaning will be	clearly understood:  form- any unique sequence of alphabetic	characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed	by a space.	4.922165479551762
9733. occurrence- an instance of a form in text.	5.066959048406199
9734. we propose a method for selecting only dictionary information	required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information	directly to the occurrences in text.	5.087562364432138
9735. we accomplish this by compiling	a list of text forms as text is read by the computer.	4.318670503113022
9736. a random-storage	scheme based on the spelling of forms provides an economical	way to compile this text-form list.	5.89047460015503
9737. dictionary forms found to match	forms in the text list are marked.	4.535752126583474
9738. a location in the computer store	is also named for each marked form; dictionary information about the	form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences	of the form in text.	4.737638784068538
9739. finally information is retrieved from the dictionary	as required by stages of the translation process- the grammatic	description for sentence-structure determination equivalent-choice	information for semantic analysis and target-language equivalents	for output construction.	3.827721743515095
9740. the dictionary is a form dictionary	at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching	text occurrences with dictionary entries.	5.952258027209325
9741. also the dictionary	is divided into at least two parts: the list of dictionary forms and	the file of information that pertains to these forms.	4.594877136226703
9742. a more detailed	description of dictionary operations- text lookup and dictionary	modification- give a clearer picture.	5.9442944788845
9743. text lookup as we will	describe it consists of three steps.	5.1555726509103605
9744. the first is compiling a list	of text forms assigning an information cell to each and replacing text	occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each	occurrence.	5.3451027561732385
9745. for this step the computer memory is separated into three	regions: cells in the w-region are used for storage of the forms	in the text-form list; cells in the x-region and y region	are reserved as information cells for text forms.	3.6325744712302357
9746. when an occurrence	f is isolated during text reading a random memory address f	the address of a cell in the x-region is computed from the form	of f.	5.125721925080692
9747. let f denote the form of f.	7.9152540337068364
9748. if cell f has not previously	been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form	list it is now assigned as the information cell of f.	5.413728914253693
9749. the form itself	is stored in the next available cells of the w-region beginning	in cell f.	4.590566699084531
9750. the address f and the number of cells required to	store the form are written in f; the information cell f is saved	to represent the text occurrence.	5.1245285307660025
9751. text reading continues with the next	occurrence.	5.66037853959279
9752. let us assume that f is identical to the form	of an occurrence f which preceded f in the text.	5.745708738432951
9753. when this situation	exists the address f will equal f which was produced from f.	4.822226658937286
9754. if f was assigned as the information cell for f the routine can	detect that f is identical to f by comparing f with the form	stored at location f.	5.0457031707257185
9755. the address f is stored in the cell f.	4.320730508808147
9756. when	as in this case the two forms match the address f is saved to	represent the occurrence f.	5.976336753202418
9757. text reading continues with the next	occurrence.	5.66037853959279
9758. a third situation is possible.	9.231862163652615
9759. the formula for computing	random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a	distinct address for each distinct form.	4.044906074467617
9760. thus when more than one distinct	form leads to a particular cell in the x-region a chain of	information cells must be created to accommodate the forms one cell	in the chain for each form.	5.400625746634191
9761. if f leads to an address f that is equal	to the address computed from f even though f does not match f	the chain of information cells is extended from f by storing the	address of the next available cell in the y-region f in f.	3.5304784374382128
9762. the	cell f becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned	as the information cell of f.	5.2920541105344485
9763. a third cell can be added by storing	the address of another y-cell in f; similarly as many cells	are added as are required.	3.920284164508789
9764. each information cell in the chain contains	the address of the y-cell where the form to which it is assigned	is stored.	6.00729595227429
9765. each cell except the last in the chain also contains	the address of the y-cell that is the next element of the chain;	the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the	chain.	4.6934928263916245
9766. hence when the address f is computed from f the cell f	and	all y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether	f is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form	list and the chain.	5.417345627227592
9767. when the information cell for f has been determined	it is saved as a representation of f.	4.492664143575369
9768. text reading continues	with the next occurrence.	7.603896187885215
9769. text reading is terminated when	a pre-determined number of forms have been stored in the text-form list.	4.060235568763422
9770. this initiates the second step of glossary lookup- connecting the	information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms.	5.273154028911168
9771. each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form	list.	5.772214281725437
9772. each time a dictionary form matches a text form the information	cell of the matching text form is saved.	5.720729335189272
9773. the number of dictionary	forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved.	4.741820498547036
9774. these two pieces	of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text	form constitute the table of dictionary usage.	5.611185526328496
9775. if each text form is	marked when matched with a dictionary form the text forms not contained	in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have	been read.	3.7869944843092105
9776. the appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken	at that time.	5.454300555224472
9777. each dictionary form is looked up in the text-form	list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in	the form list during text reading.	4.307068381503211
9778. a random address f that lies within	the x-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the	i-th dictionary form.	5.258925197803143
9779. if cell f is an information cell it and	any information cells in the y-region that have been linked to f	each contain an address in the w-region where a potentially matching	form is stored.	3.7049239243260446
9780. the dictionary form is compared with each of these	text forms.	5.904708967783999
9781. when a match is found an entry is made in the table of	dictionary usage.	5.495861426532788
9782. if cell f is not an information cell we conclude	that the i-th dictionary form is not in the text list.	6.647335070411993
9783. these	two steps essentially complete the lookup operation.	5.3285636594893
9784. the final step	merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information	that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list and	uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach	the appropriate information to each occurrence in text.	4.625163008649497
9785. the list of	text forms in the w-region of memory and the contents of the information	cells in the x and y-regions are no longer required.	3.633879381299229
9786. only	the assignment of the information cells is important.	6.997817953744141
9787. the	first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis	of the input text.	4.479502172811557
9788. the grammatical description of each occurrence in	the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis.	4.889557281264576
9789. a description of this process will serve to illustrate how any	type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached	to each text occurrence.	3.8837515834948118
9790. the grammatic descriptions of all forms	in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary	file.	5.681942804882661
9791. the order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe.	4.318636346748716
9792. when entries are being retrieved from this file the table of dictionary	usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store	in the computer.	5.228557649848442
9793. this selection-rejection process takes place as the	file is read.	4.987041256881453
9794. each entry that is selected for storage is written into	the next available cells of the w-region.	5.832498387033187
9795. the address of the	first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information	cell for the form.	4.419101569812741
9796. when the complete file has been	read the grammatic descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary	have been stored in the w-region; the information cell assigned	to each text form contains the address of the grammatic description	of the form it represents.	5.047442218095437
9797. hence the description of each text	occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text-ordered information-cell	addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information	cell for each occurrence.	4.122538332621795
9798. the only requirements on	dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each	form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form	list and that information for each form be available in a sequence	identical with the sequence of the forms.	5.0841561637272665
9799. this leaves the ordering	of entries variable.	5.860285214927587
9800. two very useful ways for modifying a form-dictionary	are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms	rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more	than one dictionary form.	5.561135099643173
9801. the former is intended to decrease the amount	of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage.	4.30550119960721
9802. the latter is useful	for modifying information about some or all forms of a word hence	reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents.	5.583405149239224
9803. applying	the techniques developed at harvard for generating a paradigm from	a representative form and its classification we can add all forms of	a word to the dictionary at once.	3.6754664226547398
9804. an extension of the principle would	permit entering a grammatic description of each form.	6.724976794579506
9805. equivalents could	be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the	dictionary or after the word has been studied in context.	4.252357095251678
9806. thus one can	think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form.	6.922567852897336
9807. if	all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary	a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible.	4.176954915387961
9808. for example the inflected forms of a word can be represented	insofar as regular inflection allows by a stem and a set of endings to	be attached.	5.796747974328619
9809. the full forms can be derived from such information	just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list.	4.036959019284454
9810. similarly if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary the	equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they	apply	to each form.	5.1526278479157215
9811. the dictionary system is in no way dependent upon	such summarization or designed around it.	4.066625838582634
9812. when irregularity and variation	prevent summarizing information is written in complete detail.	6.722408246988701
9813. entries	are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information	retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary	operations is decreased.	3.9979581465151512
9814. in sentences patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations	of influences that can only be suggested here.	5.666519788732026
9815. the tendency is toward	putting dominant stress at the end.	4.320699760725407
9816. there is a parallel to this tendency	in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes.	6.7824716396431945
9817. thus the	first lines of one of charles wesley's hymns are as follows.	5.696960357300556
9818. a charge to keep i have a god to glorify.	6.879448761674897
9819. in the	tune to which this hymn is most often sung boylston the syllables	have and fy ending their lines have twice the time any	other syllables have.	3.7477334548594032
9820. dominant stress is of course more than extended	duration and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress	or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of	were spoken alone: a dominant stress given to glorify would normally	center on its first syllable rather than its last.	4.745008460151349
9821. but the parallel	is significant.	8.225417453773382
9822. when the answer to what's wrong now?	10.132595614676253
9823.  is bill's	broken a chair dominant stress will usually be on the complement	a chair.	5.0128522087937215
9824. from the point of view of syntactic analysis the	head word in the statement is the predicator has broken and from	the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers	in the breaking; but dominant stress will be assigned to broken	only in rather exceptional versions of the sentence.	5.394631361696617
9825. in i know one	thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing;	in one thing i know it will usually be on the predicator know.	4.04232723000672
9826. in small-town people are very friendly dominant stress will	generally be on the complement very friendly; in the double sentence	the smaller the town the friendlier the people it will generally	be on the subjects the town and the people.	4.794547048694151
9827. in what's	a linguist?	8.278437049563516
9828.  dominant stress will generally be on the subject	a linguist; in who's a linguist?	5.98311281725967
9829.  it will generally be on	the complement a linguist.	6.338916692628243
9830. dominant stress is on her luggage	both in that's her luggage where her luggage is the complement	and in there's her luggage where it is the subject.	5.740562434177765
9831. adverbial	second complements however are likely not to have dominant stress	when they terminate sentences.	4.457368157505818
9832. if the answer to what was that noise?	9.086842200844474
9833. 	is george put the cat out dominant stress will ordinarily	be on the first complement the cat not the second complement	out.	4.2432202266665495
9834. final adjuncts may or may not have dominant stress.	8.44302567589872
9835. if the	answer to what was that noise?	6.104300698969425
9836.  is george reads the news emotionally	dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally.	7.330709876465173
9837. when prepositional complements are divided as in what are you	looking for?	5.004194486013785
9838.  they are likely to lose dominant stress.	9.79781098609094
9839. context	is of extreme importance.	6.683325264329536
9840. what is new in the context is likely	to be made more prominent than what is not.	6.689563641625232
9841. thus in a context in which	there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is	new dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snows	here but in a context in which there has been discussion of local	weather but no mention of snow dominant stress will probably be on snows.	3.81233702146995
9842. the personal pronouns and substitute one are normally unstressed	because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context.	5.451654387306854
9843. in i'll go with george dominant stress is probably on george;	but if george has just been mentioned prominently	what is said is probably	i'll go with him and dominant stress is probably on the preposition	with.	3.649274120968582
9844. when a gesture accompanies who's he?	9.703297777752711
9845.  the personal	pronoun has dominant stress because he has not been mentioned	previously.	4.736141159692586
9846. if both george and a piece of information george	does not have are prominent in the context but the idea of telling george	is new then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why	not tell george?	5.5172332086243
9847.  but when what is new in a particular context	is also fairly obvious there is normally only light stress or no stress	at all.	4.254360913335422
9848. thus the unstressed it of it rarely snows here gets	its significance from its use with snows: nothing can snow snow	but it.	5.621311585578762
9849. in there aren't many young people in the neighborhood	the modifier young takes dominant stress away from its head	people: the fact that the young creatures of interest are people	seems rather obvious.	4.244821227518181
9850. if women replaced people it would normally	have dominant stress.	7.317853478826358
9851. in i have things to do the word things	makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress	than do.	4.282393580088321
9852. if work is substituted for things	it will have dominant stress.	7.210444879365008
9853. in i	know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than	to semantically pale thing.	5.205247092295074
9854. in i knew you when you were a child	and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that	the young woman spoken to is still pretty.	5.149825341712454
9855. dominant stress on pretty	would be almost insulting here.	5.066959048406199
9856. in the written language then	can be underlined or italicized to guide the reader here but much	of the time the written language simply depends on the reader's alertness	and a careless reader will have to back up and reread.	5.501615155090662
9857. often dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion.	4.996423364102433
9858. thus in it's incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress	is likely to be on incredible and eat will have strong	stress also.	5.903411564758214
9859. in she has it in for george dominant stress will ordinarily	be on in where the notion of stored-up antipathy seems to	center.	3.9020296841728688
9860. in we're painting at our garage strong stress on at	indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an	effort at painting.	5.080079763494645
9861. where there is comparison or contrast dominant	stresses normally operate to center attention.	5.080503880302152
9862. thus in his friends	are stranger than his sisters' strong stresses are normal for his	and sisters' but in his friends are stranger than his sisters	strong stresses are normal for friends and sisters.	5.0303437295048985
9863. in	he's hurting himself more than he's hurting you both himself	and you have stronger stress than they would ordinarily have if	there were no contrast.	3.725131536371901
9864. in is she chinese or japanese?	8.128897452991986
9865.  the	desire to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in their last	components produces an exceptional disregard of the normal patterns	of stress of chinese and japanese.	3.6086939204672
9866. sometimes strong stress	serves to focus an important secondary relationship.	7.3206880346027505
9867. thus in mary	wrote an account of the trip first strong stress on mary marks	mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip	strong stress on wrote marks the writing as the first of a series	of actions of mary's concerned with an account of her trip	and strong stress	on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about	which mary wrote accounts.	4.367860605364744
9868. in hunger stimulates man too the situation	is very similar.	6.866620409496401
9869. strong stress on hunger treats hunger as	an additional stimulus strong stress on stimulates treats stimulation	as an additional effect of hunger strong stress on man treats	man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation of hunger.	3.4506452011778967
9870. here again in the written language it is possible to help the	reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics but much	of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light	of context.	5.361523579484514
9871. when a word represents a larger construction of	which it is the only expressed part it normally has more stress than	it would have in fully expressed construction.	4.542449002699743
9872. thus when yes i	have is the response to have you finished reading the paper?	6.457023084192658
9873. 	the stress on have which here represents have finished reading	the paper is quite strong.	4.21292691591616
9874. in mack's the leader at camp but	jack is here the is of the second main declarative represents	is the leader and therefore has stress.	5.388485670579262
9875. mack's the leader at	camp but jack's here with this is deprived of stress makes	here the complement in the clause.	3.8880356915934375
9876. in of all the suggestions that	were made his was the silliest the possessive his represents	his suggestion and is stressed.	5.896146749614966
9877. when go represents itself and	a complement in which	boat did jack go on?	4.837732554347947
9878.  it has strong stress; when it represents	only itself and on which is its complement	on has stronger stress	than go does.	5.947149455567476
9879. omission of a subordinator pronoun however does	not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which	the subordinator pronoun would be object.	3.8851672241463446
9880. thus to has light stress	both in that was the conclusion that i came to and in that	was the conclusion i came to.	6.337284903034506
9881. but when to represents to consciousness	in that was the moment that i came to and similarly	in that was the moment i came to there is much stronger stress	on to.	4.773591809039818
9882. in i wanted to tell him but i was afraid to the final	to is lightly stressed because it represents to tell him.	5.802353971671299
9883. in	to tell him of course to is normally unstressed.	5.214061515621742
9884. when i	have instructions to leave is equivalent in meaning to i	have instructions that i am to leave this place dominant stress	is ordinarily on leave.	5.326976534635731
9885. when the same sequence is equivalent in	meaning to i have instructions which i am to leave dominant stress	is ordinarily on instructions.	4.2040173405147145
9886. it is clear that patterns	of stress sometimes	show construction unambiguously in the spoken language where	without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written.	6.293016612129251
9887. i'll come by tuesday.	6.683325264329536
9888. i	can't be happy long without drinking water.	7.1581511048922275
9889. in the first of these	sentences if by is the complement of come and tuesday is	an adjunct of time equivalent to on tuesday there will be strong	stress on by in the spoken language; but if a complement for	come is implied and by tuesday is a prepositional unit used as	an adjunct by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most.	3.6832250922469685
9890. in	the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and	without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless	i drink water there will be stronger stress on water than on	drinking; but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water	and without drinking water is equivalent to without water	for drinking there will be stronger stress on drinking than on	water.	4.808078976403815
9891. but the use of stress in comparison and contrast for example	can undermine distinctions such as these.	5.031248891706761
9892. and patterns of stress	are not always unambiguous by any means.	6.665953002163231
9893. in the steiners have	busy	lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting	relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives	or to relatives who are visiting them and in i looked	up the number and i looked up the chimney only the meanings	of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically	a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed	by its object in the second.	3.5026985541119173
9894. syllables are	linguistic units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but as	has been noted are consonantal under certain circumstances and which	may or may not be combined with preceding andor following consonants	or combinations of consonants.	5.080052191702922
9895. syllables are genuine units but division	of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties.	4.21292691591616
9896. sometimes	even the number of syllables is not clear.	8.377542487490214
9897. doubt on this point	is strongest before l and  or r.	4.681571082223364
9898. from the point of view	of	word formation real might be expected to have two syllables.	8.163308864789583
9899. historically	re is the formative that is employed also in republic	and al is the common suffix.	4.131860641767443
9900. when ity is added	real clearly has two syllables.	7.696516088703085
9901. but there is every reason to regard	deal as a monosyllable and because of the fact that l commonly	has the quality of  when it follows vowel sounds deal seems	to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with real.	4.724035974504259
9902. it is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less	successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels.	5.544241669729324
9903. no single explanation is adequate to account for this.	5.613646290821733
9904. improvement	however is urgent and at least three things will be needed.	6.388781855087688
9905. the first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses.	4.93965684388654
9906. even	beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable	variety of consonant systems both in their general outlines and in	many specific details.	5.14920930941904
9907. an advanced student has read a considerable	number of descriptions of consonantal systems including some of the more	unusual types.	4.728099314062036
9908. by contrast even experienced linguists commonly know	no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple	distinction between register and contour languages.	5.973750010243533
9909. this limited	familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work	with tone.	4.775278578169377
9910. tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory	until a more representative selection of systems is familar to	every practicing field linguist.	5.637671124923923
9911. papers like these four if widely read	will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work.	4.131860641767443
9912. the second need is better field techniques.	7.439551532653989
9913. the great majority	of present-day linguists fall into one or more of a number of overlapping	types: those who are convinced that tone cannot be analysed those who	are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally those who	are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in	those languages where it occurs those who have no idea how to proceed	with tone analysis those who take a simplistic view of the whole	matter.	3.8751153601869213
9914. the result has been neglect fumbling efforts or superficial	treatment.	7.185314972184344
9915. as these maladies overlap so must the cure.	5.822421640728078
9916. analyses such	as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone	is impossible and that it is simple.	6.585526054340024
9917. they will give suggestions that	can be worked up into field procedures.	5.300500315877244
9918. good field techniques will not	only equip linguists for better work but also help them overcome negative	attitudes.	5.954343312401235
9919. actually none of these papers says much directly about	field techniques.	5.649965535866708
9920. but it is worth pondering that very little has	been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics.	6.441834098492443
9921. these	things have been disseminated by other means but always in the wake	of extensive publication of analytic results.	4.1091071816313445
9922. the third need	is for better theory.	7.5531223094256665
9923. we should expect that general phonologic theory	should be as adequate for tone as for consonants and vowels but it has	not been.	4.19129302912496
9924. this can only be for one of two reasons: either the two	are quite different and will require totally different theory	or our existing theories are insufficiently general.	5.6768376713478075
9925. if as i suspect the problem is largely of the second sort then development	of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically	in better theory for all phonologic subsystems.	4.000238413358723
9926. one issue	that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different	phonologic subsystems.	6.260039061283256
9927. since tone systems typically comprise fewer	units than either consonant or vowel systems we might expect that they	would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis.	4.137733729470427
9928. actual practice	does not often work out this way.	6.806723317680827
9929. tone systems are certainly more complex	than the number of units would suggest and often analytically	more difficult than much larger consonantal systems.	4.197378005581744
9930. welmers has	suggested one explanation.	8.978076491592427
9931. tone languages use for linguistic contrasts	speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use.	4.21292691591616
9932. this may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion	for the more knowledgeable.	6.803132564402433
9933. the problem is to disentangle the	linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic	features.	4.775825987940963
9934. of course something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of	the phonology: consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and	an individual component.	6.287070431064111
9935. but in general the individual variation is	a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude.	4.758260845212266
9936. with tone individual differences may be greater than the linguistic	contrasts which are superimposed on them.	6.029969712640202
9937. pitch differences from	one speaker to another or from one emotional state to another may far	exceed the small differences between tones.	3.841511969386553
9938. however any such suggestion	accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone or in	developing a realistic attitude about tone but not for the analytic	difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded.	5.4050979833394175
9939. a second explanation is suggested by the material described in rowlands'	paper.	4.956710032778864
9940. tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed.	7.1581511048922275
9941. neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate	the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the	other.	4.425261780268382
9942. other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap	in this way; for example duration sometimes figures in both the	vowel system and the intonation.	5.477463054054436
9943. some phonetic features for example	glottal catch or murmur are sometimes to be assigned to segmental phonemics	and sometimes to accentual systems.	4.094369307136436
9944. but no other two phonologic	systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in	some languages.	5.848288414670871
9945. this explanation of tone difficulties however does	not apply in all languages.	4.64192548420022
9946. in some	interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation	spans.	6.397269258238096
9947. in many of the syllables intonation can be safely ignored	and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation.	5.264271791762761
9948. still even in such languages tone analysis has not been as	simple as one might expect.	6.631361152996561
9949. a third explanation is suggested	by richardson's analysis of sukuma tone.	5.057558168975038
9950. there we see a basically	simple phonemic system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic	system.	7.082941503072571
9951. while the phonemes can be very easily stated no one	is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences	can be related in some way to morphemic units ie until the morphophonemics	is worked out or at least far enough that it seems reasonable	to expect success.	4.08388685086096
9952. in the typical tone language	tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal	morphophonemics.	6.598844113973106
9953. the phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic	systems however are very different.	4.126437161889454
9954. the inventory of tones	is much smaller and commonly the contrasts range along one single	dimension pitch level.	5.280652153416978
9955. consonantal systems are not merely larger they	are multidimensional.	5.505556175977097
9956. morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining	certain points in the system.	6.564108140383885
9957. the possibilities in the consonantal	system are very numerous and only a small portion of them are actually	used.	4.2244995596506785
9958. phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show	a good bit of phonetic similarity possible because of the several dimensions	of contrast in the system.	5.490718726980992
9959. tonal morphophonemics in a common	case can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone.	4.131860641767443
9960. the possibilities	are few and the total number of rules may be considerably greater.	5.289832921804139
9961. often therefore there are a number of rules having the same	effect and commonly other sets of rules as well having the opposite	effect.	4.509307162511492
9962. tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning	analyst than consonantal morphophonemics even when the total number	of rules is no greater.	5.510341104387857
9963. the difficulty of analysis of any subsystem	in the phonology is an inverse function of the size- smaller systems	are more troublesome- for any given degree of morphophonemic	complexity.	3.6376547833341233
9964. this hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties	of tonal analysis as well as the fact that vowel systems are	often more puzzling than consonantal systems.	7.578840654416736
9965. the statement of the system	is a different matter.	5.853191732838708
9966. smaller systems can of course be stated	much more succinctly.	7.094035153694507
9967. a phonemic system can be stated without reference	to morphophonemics but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics.	4.028644573802707
9968. and the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation	to the phonemic base the less easily a phonemic system will be analysed	without close attention to the morphophonemics- at least the less	satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through	morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures.	5.145549786011443
9969. the design of orthographies has received much less attention from	linguists than the problem deserves.	4.162804476583787
9970. there has been a tendency on the	part of many american linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription	will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only	real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance.	5.962823187655316
9971. most others have been content to give only the most	general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology	when designing orthographies.	4.531803854850072
9972. apparently the feeling is that	anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible	pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs.	5.327608002859078
9973. the result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography	conferences by such considerations as typographic 'esthetics'	which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain prejudices	carried over from european languages.	4.464281965224241
9974. many of the suggested systems	seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures	that they purport to represent.	6.159481708987094
9975. linguists have not always been	more enlightened than practical people and sometimes have insisted	on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater	significance.	3.7605603237349414
9976. as a result many people have been confirmed in their	conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts	can contribute anything but confusion.	6.1641313378732265
9977. a e sharp	in vowel-length and syllabicity in kikuyu examines one set of related	orthographic questions and its phonologic background in detail.	3.819461894978747
9978. his	objective is merely to determine what distinctions of length and	syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a kikuyu orthography	.	5.819555648081702
9979. to do so he finds it necessary to examine the relevant	parts of the phonology thoroughly and in detail.	5.240927667623883
9980. in the process he	develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort	that are often difficult.	6.299064591194155
9981. a few of his examples are of very great interest	and the whole discussion of some importance for theory.	4.544756766510117
9982. his orthographic	recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on	the one hand or of superficiality on the other.	5.5016206160338434
9983. rather he weighs each	phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness.	5.513605054128364
9984. he concludes	that some changes can made in the current orthography which will	appreciably improve its usefulness but hesitates to suggest precise	graphic devices to effect these changes.	5.350851192166029
9985. i hope his suggestions are	given the consideration they deserve in kikuyu circles.	4.844280759707605
9986. this however	will not exhaust their practical usefulness as they rather clearly	indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography	design.	5.302425132868048
9987. we need many more studies of this sort if the design	of written languages is to be put on a sound basis.	5.291597111752146
9988. one other	paper deals with a phonologic problem: vowel harmony in igbo by	j carnochan.	6.268266226065032
9989. this restates the already widely known facts in terms	of prosodies.	4.799082862291682
9990. as a restatement it makes only a small contribution	to knowledge of igbo.	6.765517506271723
9991. but it would seem more intended as a tract advocating	the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems	of igbo phonology.	4.608867829487951
9992. the paper has a certain value as a comparatively	easy introduction to this approach particularly since it treats	a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it is possible	to compare it with a more traditional statement.	5.1111042453793445
9993. it does show one feature of the system that has not been previously	described.	6.585467634352181
9994. but it does not as it claims demonstrate that this could	not be treated by traditional methods.	6.8901914776764155
9995. it seems to me that it rather	easily can.	8.049484846871403
9996. five of the papers deal with grammatical problems.	8.673874775080277
9997. on the whole they maintain much the same high standard but they	are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider	variety of subject matter.	4.64106895616561
9998. my comments must be briefer than the papers	deserve.	7.584522283313379
9999. w h whiteley writes on the verbal radical	in iraqw.	4.905791102390226
10000. this must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement	to his early a short description of item-categories in iraqw.	5.869831261854837
