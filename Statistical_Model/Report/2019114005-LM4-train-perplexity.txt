Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and in today â€™s lecture , which is lecture number seventeen , I am going to cover or begin our discussion on ionic chain polymerization.	3.246455427926739
Now , in this lecture I plan to cover discuss the general characteristics of ionic chain polymerization , and while discussing I will compare how this ionic chain polymerization compares with radical chain polymerization.	3.007618863714681
And then we will go to cationic chain polymerization and talk about different types of initiation for cationic chain polymerization , and then go to propagation and termination reactions in cationic chain polymerization.	2.503320122702006
And then I will talk about kinetics of cationic chain polymerization and then energetics of cationic chain polymerization.	2.525942419766888
And in next lecture , I plan to talk about the other type of ionic polymerization , which is anionic chain polymerization.	2.635272425367544
Now , let us begin our discussion on ionic chain polymerization.	2.7174345986785577
Now , as the name suggest , in this case the initiation is from an anionic species , whether it is a cation or anion.	3.222767562622202
Say , if I consider M as a monomer and I is a , initiation , initiator , then it could be a cation or an anion , which will , according to which we name cationic polymerization or anionic polymerization.	3.0170407419164262
It could be acceptance of electron giving rise to a radical anion or removal of an electron , which gives to radical cation , which two of which might combine to give you a dianion or a dication which can further initiate the chain reactions from both the sides.	3.6438493772604055
So , this is example , this is a case of cationic polymerization.	2.150313713852998
This is a case of cationic polymerization and this two are the case of anionic polymerization.	2.339293460991794
Now , in this case , the ionic species are the initiator or rather the initiators are ionic species , so as the propagating species also ionic.	2.9805641591363674
Now , the some polymerization , for example , initiation by coordination or semi clock side , which also progress through an ionic species , propagating , propagates through ionic species route , but those we are not going to cover as an ionic chain polymerization.	3.391302213464013
So , ionic chain polymerization we will consider only when both the initiation and the propagation reaction is by ionic species.	2.5768545902146944
Now , like radical chain polymerization , these ionic chain polymers , polymerization reactions are not very popular commercially.	2.5107655693165314
There are main , too main reasons why they are not so utilized commercially.	3.966363436354352
One is that stringent requirement of polymerization in case of this ionic polymerization.	2.565832165035427
We require very , stringest , stringent conditions , which are difficult to achieve in a large industrial scale and also , this ionic polymerization are very selective , which means , that not every monomer can be polymerized by ionic polymerization , unlike , unlike radical case where most of the , poly , monomers , double bond monomers can be polymerized by radical chain polymerization we can assume.	3.2281025483610315
So , these are the main two reasons why this ionic chain polymerization , are not practiced that commercially in that scale.	3.229938760481592
And so in that sense , it is not that important like radical chain polymerization.	2.6827354762020312
However , this polymerization is ionic chain polymerization , gives us opportunity to synthesize specialized polymers , like block copolymers or tellically polymers , which are basically type polymers , having functional groups at the end of the chain , which we can , we utilized for the , for another reactions.	3.0145614802038048
So , let us start the discussion on ionic polymerization and let us talk about first the general characteristics.	3.0299264883218315
And while talking these general characteristics of ionic polymerization we will compare its differences or its likeliness with the chain , radical chain polymerization.	3.088262134305453
First is that as I just said , that it is , it is much more selective , much more selective.	3.322346016414281
Now , why do we started our discussion on chain polymerization.	2.67300167578871
We talked about , that this monomers like this ether , which have electron donating group like there oxygen , which can be lone pair , can be donated if it is a cationic centre here.	3.6085488574476536
Now , this type of monomers can be polymerized by cationic chain polymer , polymerization reaction because the resulting cationic propagating can be stabilized by the electron donating , mechanizing donation by the oxygen from here.	2.7980969316751096
Now , for anionics , for anionic chain polymerization we need to have monomers , which have electron withdrawing group , electron withdrawing group , which could be , as we discussed earlier , something like this , acrylates or methacrylates , and , and so on , with this can be polymerized anionically because the resulting anion can be stabilized by this resonating with the carbonyl bond.	3.0497293240867753
So , in that sense , this anionic and cationic polymerization at very and only if the monomer has , monomer with , monomers with , with inductive effect and ability to stabilize the propagating species by resonance in the , both for cationic and anionic , then this monomers can be polymerized by both cationic and anionic.	3.245007005270161
So , if I write on the , complete this sentence , in that you can able to do , stabilize both cationic and anionic propagating species.	3.408553263459389
For example , you have styrene where both cationic and anionic can be stabilized by resonance with this aromatic proof or say , cation , resulting cation or anionic can be stabilized by resonance from this double bond.	3.397139506272801
As we see , we have seen now from this discussion , that not every monomer can be polymerized by anionically and there is a set of polymer , a set of monomers , which can be polymerized anionically.	2.9672180542257798
And you know , less number of monomers can be polymerized cationically , and there are even lesser number polymers , which can be polymerized by both anionic and cationic polymerization.	2.8166413294523287
While in case of radical we have seen , that all this , this monomers or this monomers or this can be all polymerized by radical chain polymerization.	2.5952386767262117
So , in that case , in that composition radical is a , radical chain polymerization is much least sensitive compared to the ionic polymerization.	2.756540415721358
Now , second characteristics , if you want to talk about , is the effect of polarity , effect of polarity of the solvent.	3.175564877998992
It is not only polarity , but the capability of the solvent molecules to solvate the ionic species giving the chain propagation.	2.9040718255594546
Now , as you have seen earlier , that a propagation reaction can be this.	2.4687589784220645
It is either cationic species or anionic species.	3.0621710748414133
Now , this anionic species or cationic species , they are not present alone in the medium , they are always associated with or accompanied by a counter ion.	3.4339139739624676
For the positive it is a anion , for negative it is a cation.	3.3539309419030325
So , this propagating chain are always of this ionic group , are always accompanied by a counter ion of oppositely charged , that is always happens.	3.4496345170443727
Now , depending on the association behavior of these two species , the active center and the counter ion , the reactivity of the propagating species varies.	2.8744692028996868
What I mean , that if they are very tightly bound , they are very tight , then obviously , the accessibility of , or the reactivity of this ionic center are less.	3.398067618919186
So , the propagating species is less reactive.	2.498291805922636
While if you compare with the situation where they are well separated , they are like free , free hands.	3.1989216967617553
Now , if they are free , then obviously , they are more accessible and the reactivity of this propagating species , ionic propagating species are much more reactive or much more reactive compared to situation when they are tight ion - pair.	2.9156562252134006
So , it is always preferred , that you have a polar solvent , it is , this is always preferred.	2.7949010998748545
We do ionic reaction in a polar solvent because if you have polar solvent , then this oppositely charge ions , ions will be well separated in the medium and if they are well separated , obviously , the reactivity of the active center in the propagating chain will be higher.	3.026213700681924
So , you have a higher rate of reaction or an eventually higher molecular build up.	2.8233039356293155
Now , often if you use polar solvent , for example if you use hydroxylated solvents , hydroxylated solvents like say , H 2 O or alcohol , what happens.	3.373967796720578
This , this reacts , this hydroxylated solvents react very , very fast , you know , very effectively they react with this ionic species and then stop the chain.	3.012947291510148
So , these ionic centers are destroyed with reaction of this hydroxyl , hydroxy molecules , H 2 O or alcohol.	3.516830204060769
If you have other polar solvents , like say ketone , what happens.	3.0911133279856293
This ketone loop complex form complex with this ionic species and then once they form complex , the reactivity of this ionic species are lost.	3.208743782326312
So , you do not have an effective polymerization happening.	2.4020644200465773
So , you require a polar solvent to have these charges separated and ions as free as possible.	3.5587728059386663
Similarly , if you use very high polar solvents , like hydroxylated solvents or ketone , then the reaction actually gets stopped by reaction of these solvent molecules with the reactive species.	2.819828645769477
So , eventually or practically , a low to moderate polarity solvents like , say methylene chloride or say , methylene dichloride or THF , or ether or nitrobenzene.	4.7015785627528714
So , these are the examples of some of the solvents , which have , medium , low to medium polarity and does not high react with those ionic species.	3.059652549082864
They , they actually can be used for ionic species polymerization , but this is , these are not very generic in the sense , that the solvents , this solvents also can react with anionic species as well.	2.9857213301755605
So , we have , we will discuss specifically for the requirement of solvent.	2.397982033692785
We will talk about cationic and anionic polymerization individually.	2.469911312876555
Now , how this , if you want to write a , a generic structure of , say , to write , write a cationic propagating species , which have , which a cationic reactive centre and a counter ion , which is represented by A minus , so what are the possible states they can represent.	3.4403691366316167
One , they can be completely covalent bonding , covalent bonded , covalent bonded , one.	4.03889466475397
Two , they can be tight ion - pair ; these are very tight , no solvent molecule in between.	3.445601253121047
So , tight ion - pair or sometimes it is called contact ion - pair or see , some people say intimate ion - pair.	4.991704806548212
Same thing is called with different names.	3.5898780842301172
It can be present as solvated.	3.288135770070428
So , solvated has three solvated ion - pair or loose ion - pair or they can be totally free , free ion - pair.	4.384393375465667
So , these are the possible , depending upon the polarity of the medium this could the four possible association state between these two ionic species.	3.025569667853102
Now , it , we have given examples of cation and anion here where the propagating species is B plus , is said the both cationic polymerization , the propagating species in cationic polymerization.	2.753283940552983
But it can be true ; this post can be true for the other anionic polymerization as well.	3.426440357754915
Now , obviously , with the increase in the polarity of the medium , if you increase the polarity of the medium , this , this , the more polar means , the ions get solvated and then finally , get as free ion , ion - pair.	3.13337096742826
So , as the reactivity of the ionic centre , obviously , the free is the ionic center it gets , it becomes more reactive.	3.2054273316157715
So , which means and in some cases these , these are not present isolately , they actually remain in equilibrium and equilibrium shifts depending upon the polarity of the medium.	3.1494618822837936
So , in this way you can understand , that solvents play , solvent means , I mean polarity of the solvent plays a very important role in terms of reactivity of these ionic reactions.	3.1363295615162428
And if you compare with radical chain polymerization , solvent polarity actually has no such role to play in case of radical chain polymerization.	2.8368732002382715
You have to only check whether the solvent can solubilize the monomer or the reagent and it , solvent should not participate in the undesired chain transfer reactions.	3.0637051844893453
So , this type of solvent dependent reactivity was absent in case of radical chain polymerization.	2.5574169245773697
So , third characteristic we can talk about and compare the nature of reaction.	3.0648460729591513
Now , this , these are complex reactions as we will find out from further discussion , that these are complex reaction and they are very fast.	2.762936972784618
They are fast ; they are about , say , 10 to the power 4 to 10 to the power of 6 times of the reaction rate of radical chain polymerization.	2.8335899102685347
So , they are very fast and this fast nature of this reaction is due to the fact , that the accumulation of this active centers.	3.0867886757216296
And as we will immediately discuss , that in case of ionic reaction , this bimolecular , molecular , termination bimolecular termination by reaction between two propagating species is absent or absent because they are anionic charge.	2.889447534081103
One cation cannot react with another cation , cationic propagating species and terminate the reactions in case of radical.	2.8065800867512958
What you have seen , that radical , two radical propagating species can react with each other and can terminate either by combination or by in case of cationic , anionic polymerization or cation polymerization.	2.921502023694698
Because they have seen this propagation species are similarly charged , they cannot react with each other and terminate the chains.	2.8089242992222747
As a result , there is a huge increase in the concentration of these active centers in the medium and as a result , the reaction is very fast.	2.879146123327089
But in case of radicals we have seen , that the steady state concentration of the active radicals is very low and as a result , the propagation was comparatively low in a slower , in compression to these ionic polymerization.	2.938817654961883
And as these ionic centers are very reactive , they are very sensitive to , very sensitive to impurities , which includes moisture because they are very active , reactive.	3.502354375756727
These ionic centers are very reactive , they are very sensitive to this impurities where you know , that radical , though radical chain polymerization are sensitive to impurities , but they are not as radical chain polymerization , is not as sensitive as in case of ionic chain polymerization and sometimes large effect of , large effect of cocatalyst.	3.1461761301309497
Cocatalyst are nothing but small inorganic compounds , like say H 2 O , can be observed in case of ionic polymerization have , which was not the case of radical polymerization.	3.0743438153572606
And as the reaction is very fast and complex , this kinetic data , kinetic data are often , often not reproducible because this kinetic data is not always reproducible , especially in this case of kinetics , especially in case of cationic polymerization , cationic , the mechanism and the mechanism on kinetics of this ionic polymerization , especially cationic chain polymerization is still not completely understood , to understand the mechanism in kinetics of this ionic polymerization , especially the cationic one , because as I said , these reactions are very fast and not reproducible.	3.133600571513887
And as I said earlier , this four is your , the termination reactions.	2.960551730904316
As I said , that bimolecular termination is not possible , bimolecular termination by the action of two propagating species is not possible and so if you can suppress the other , other reactions , which are chain transfer reaction , if you can suppress those , you can actually keep this chains , this ionic chains as living because you can , because the inherent or intrinsic termination reaction between the propagating species are not there , they are absent.	2.9210555824694793
So , if you can stop the side reactions , which includes the chain transfer reaction , then you can actually make this chain alive or this polymerization could be living polymerization and that is especially true for anionic polymerization.	2.6854751238957677
You will find out in later discussion , that in case of cationic there are other ways , which are likely like chain transfer reactions , but in case of anionic it is comfortably easy to make polymerization , leaving chain polymerization.	3.0880995178103317
Whereas , in case of radical , we know , that this termination can be possible by bimolecular reaction of the two propagating new species.	2.81855716910778
So , let us now talk in detail about the cationic polymerization.	2.8618126455369333
So , let us talk about and again , like radical polymerization if any chain polymerization , this cationic chain polymerization we were discussing.	2.5005989448190915
So , I should write cationic chain polymerization.	2.259062439957011
So , it consists of three steps : initiation , propagation and termination.	2.922716389335635
First , let us talk about different types of initiation reactions , different types of initiation reaction and first one is , which is more common is , by reaction of monomer with an electrophile , say R plus and this electophile could be H plus , which you get it from protonic acids.	3.19856998012447
Now , if I write generic way , H plus plus A , generic structure of a monomer , it gives you CH 3 CH Y , cationic species , and A minus.	3.98214568520095
This is counter A minus , is the counter ion.	3.6989001263659738
Now , HX would be strong enough if these acids should be stronger enough to produce significant concentration of the protonal species , so that it can initiate , react with the monomer.	3.3265552687485167
And A minus , the counter ion , should not be heavy , strong nucleophile because if it is a very strong nucleophile , then it can react with the cationic group and make a covalent bond and stop the reaction there itself.	3.4289071102955786
For example , if I consider a case of halogen acids like HX and take the generic structure of the monomer with the reaction , we put on electrophilic reaction , it will form the same initiating species , but because this halogen anion is , is so strong nucleophile , it will actually combine again and form a covalent bond.	3.4331184375841977
So , your reaction stops there.	2.5336114960461598
You cannot have the reaction progressing further.	2.7158309656153206
So , so other protonic acids like H 2 SO 4 or say , HClO 4 or phosphoric acid.	4.306827288339095
They are used , they can be used because this counter ions are not so strong nucleophile like halide ions , but still this , this , because they are , they are also significantly nucleophilic , this cannot built very high molecular with polymers by cationic chain polymerization.	3.138861324225341
So , these are limited and the molecular weight , molecular weights are not very high for this proton by this reaction , cationic reaction by this protonation.	2.6205133092419657
So , most , most popular , most important , this electrophilic reaction is reaction of Lewis acids.	3.359820118048024
So , that is B , with the Lewis acid I can write generic structures like MX n for Lewis acids.	3.9873851425608735
Example could be BF 3 , AlCl 3 , SnCl 4 , SlCl 5 , ZnCl 2 , TiCl 4 , and so on , or they are derivatives , like RaCl 2 , R 2 AlCl and so on.	4.391421487286296
So , these are Lewis , Lewis acid can be used for supplying an electrophile for reaction with the monomer , but it is this Lewis acids are seldom used alone.	3.576772099399141
For example , if you take a reaction of isobutylene plus anhydrous BF 3 , anhydrous BF 3 , then there is no reaction.	3.1192288480685346
But at the moment you add little bit of water along with this mix , so you have the same reaction with BF 3 plus H 2 O , then there is a rapid reaction.	3.629001429863906
So , these examples showing as these Lewis acids , which we just showed in the last page , they are often used along with a second catalyst or cocatalyst , which can be water molecules or some other molecules.	3.324509554991884
We will just give examples in few minutes.	3.0934707665046473
So , if you consider this case the reaction happens like this.	2.318856592146914
BF 3 plus H 2 O makes a complex or we can use other Lewis acids and we can use this alkyl halides as a cocatalyst and this case , the complex found is like this.	3.496320587705478
So , this case , this is a protogen , which is basically proton donor protogen and this is cationogen , which is a cationic species donor or carbocationic , carbocation donor.	3.7819278745159863
Now , this is called nowadays initiator because this is the species , which is supplying the H plus or R plus.	3.191623682860306
This is coinitiator , coinitiator , BF 3 or AlCl 3 are , sometimes they are called this BF 3 or AlCl 3 , called catalyst and this initiator called cocatalyst.	4.085618681443775
So , you should be careful about this nomenclature , other you called this as initiator and coinitiator or you called this as catalyst and this is the cocatalyst.	3.5954436657941216
Now , I can write generic reaction for this type of reaction.	2.6523780098506538
Now , once you form this , again react with the monomer and form the initiating species , which let us write in next page.	3.0845629518267734
Similarly , you can write this similar reaction for this aluminum chloride and alkyl halide reaction.	3.059974071017294
This alkyl halide could be , say for example , R could be tertiary carbon or could be a triphenyl carbon group.	4.150894279085489
So , this is example of alkyl halide , which is used for this cocatalyst or initiator in this reaction.	2.830092355125636
So , I , I can write a generic equation or expression , say I , I for the initiator and YZ , this is for your coinitia , I for the coinitiator , this is for the initiator or this for catalyst and this is for the cocatalyst , giving rise to a cationic species and a counter ion.	3.639737822196152
This is I and which then react with a monomer forming the chain initiating spices.	3.398507389807763
Now , we are writing ki for this reaction because it has been found out , that of these two reactions , this is the two reactions , consists of chain reaction , chain initiation reaction.	2.893586622799441
This , this is the step , which is rate determining step.	2.72014817131932
So , we will consider this reaction while calculating or while determining the , or looking at the kinetics of this chain polymerization.	2.877087214169199
Remember , if you compare with the radical chain polymerization , this was the first reaction compared to the step , the first step , where radical was getting generated from the initiator molecule and we considered that as a rate determining step for radical chain polymerization.	2.6589598799361664
But in this ionic chain polymerization we , this is the faster reaction step where this is the slower and rate determining step.	2.834672065562521
So , for ionic reaction monomer also participate in the chain initiation reaction where in case of radical monomer was not actually part of the chain initiating expression Now , the reaction rate also depend , depends on this YZ , which is basically a cocatalyst.	2.9302050307886014
It will also influence the polymerization rate because the activity of the initiation complex depends how readily it can transfer a proton to the monomer and that in turn depends on the acidity of this cocatalyst.	3.0778313861732323
For example , if I consider ionic , cationic polymerization of isobutylene by tin chloride catalyst , then the reactivity of this reaction or the rate of reaction follows Rp , follows in the order like this , nitroethane , nitroethane , phenol , water , which is basically the ranking of the acidity of this cocatalyst.	3.417575004726051
So , basically the type of cocatalyst also influence the polymerization because the acidity of this , this complex , the activity of this complex depends on how readily it can supply this cationic species , where I say proton or in this case it is a proton or a carbocation to the monomer , and for a proton or protogen or a proton supplier , it depends on the acidity of the cocatalyst.	3.1824595696221727
So , it follows this trend and for the carbon cationic generator like RCl , like AlCl 3 plus , this reaction.	3.5251529022355608
Now , this reaction complex , the , the activity , the total polymerization rate dependence on this RCl is little complex and we will keep the discussion for this course.	2.8090392318356585
So , you should just remember that the , the structure of the cocatalyst also determines the rate of polymerization and also affect the rate of polymerization , and we will now see that.	2.669560228674614
Obviously , I , the catalyst or the coinitiator also affects the rate of polymerization.	2.669116066025388
Now , now Lewis , Lewis acid , we are talking about this reaction are the initiation , is by Lewis acids.	3.1979426294523003
So , Lewis acidity of these defined metals increases with atomic number.	4.082948917703111
We know that Lewis acidity follow this order.	3.4065583133177935
This Lewis acidity of this defined metals increases with the atomic numbers.	3.9150409207139436
So , for a single metal , say , if we consider titanium , then again the Lewis acidity increases with the oxidation number.	3.5422159714130985
So , TiCl 4 have more Lewis acidity compared to , Tl , TiCl 3 than this.	4.283401028550008
So , for , if you compare with defined , different metal is basically atomic number.	3.221624630540851
It will determine the Lewis acidity and for same , same metal is the oxidation state increases , the Lewis acidity increases and also the Lewis acidity.	3.519366194731253
For a single metal follow this trend of the ligand.	4.132578167091933
If this ligand , they follow this , so obviously , if the ligands are fluorine or chloride , they have much more Lewis acidity compared to the ligands are , this is , this is from your basic knowledge from inorganic chemistry , basic knowledge and this is , from this expression , you know , this is strongest Lewis acid and this is , not always we use this though it is a very strong Lewis acid , for all the cationic reaction.	3.4893919076982827
We will not use this as a catalyst or a coinitiator because rather than other complication if the reaction , it is too fast , then the side reactions also come in the picture , the side reaction also increases.	3.1504177168043226
If the side reaction rate also increases , then again the problem of molecular build up come.	2.877972650739502
So , though this trend is there , now while choosing the catalyst or the coinitiator , it is , it is not this general trend is always followed , you have to keep the other factors in mind as well.	3.781381893149237
So , we talked about the initiator reaction with by this reaction of the monomers with the electrophile.	2.4532042462636663
Now , there are other initiation reactions , other initiation reactions , for example , halogen , halogen can be reacting with more acidic Lewis acid and gives out cation , halogen cation.	3.463776912096388
This can be initiation ; can be done by photo initiation of olium salts.	3.753255056616666
It can be done by electro initiation where cationic species is formed by electrolysis of any species present in the medium or it can be done by ionic , ionization radiation , like in the case of radical the initiation can be done by ionization.	3.316756974451448
So , these are the other possible ways of initiating a cationic polymerization.	2.685626929511583
But as I mentioned in earlier , these are the generic examples , which we get in this page.	3.4794906269170864
These are the most common example of or the most important initiation reaction.	2.781578204749253
So , we will talk about kinetic.	2.257974275989554
So , energetic , we will consider this generic initiation step and also consider this initiation step , of , for the discussion because this is the most important of the initiation step we just discussed.	3.0448488537457687
So , let us now discuss the propagation step.	2.593490089686112
Propagation , we have already seen the different types of initiation possibility and as I said , we will consider the generic case , we , as I showed there.	3.0930933338521447
So , this , this was the initiation reactions.	2.3367482356052975
So , you have this initiator , coinitiator complex , which starts the chain initiation.	2.7943177159177752
I write this in the next page , it can react with the name and start the chain propagation reaction and I can write a generic expression of this in this way plus M kp n plus 1 M plus IZ minus.	3.2755216140465824
If Y is H , the photogens we can write H M n M plus IZ minus.	4.728943231867154
For examples , that Ba 3 water case , I can write this is a proton donor.	3.7618554269770583
So , I can writeâ€¦ This is the reaction of isobutylene catalysed by this reaction.	2.7431693057324535
I just recall from your earlier decision , I am writing the propagating reactions here.	3.535086110433547
This , on reacting on with isobutylene , will produce the.. ... So , these are the examples of the propagating steps and sometimes this propagation reaction could be complicated and because of this one two hydride shift , but that is not very common.	2.9553806003563263
I will just give you an example when this propagating steps could be little complicated and by hydride shift or shift and that is applicable for say , propene or one alkene , one alkenes , take example.	3.8513477873026334
Now , this can undergo a hydride shift and from this carbo cation.	3.0565690007280484
So , as a result more complicated products actually form when there is type of hydride shift or some cases methide shift , some cases shift one two methide shift.	4.112161281271078
If this happens , the reactions become very complicated and we call that sometimes isomerization polymerization as well.	2.891782252749285
But this is not common ; this is especially applicable to some monomers.	3.15168757515637
The example we gave , most common propagation steps are in this page , what we just discussed now and as you can realize , that the rate of propagation will depend on the solvents.	2.9975170810012273
We discussed in length the effect of solvent polarity and if the polarity of the solvents is high , then this ion - pair will be more towards a solvated or free ion - pairs , then in the reactivity of this cationic species will be higher.	3.0618377430056647
So , the rate of polymerization will be higher.	1.9301091535892805
Now , let us have , let us see some data related to convince that understanding.	4.249633378043666
Say , let us take example of styrene , polymerization of styrene by or chloric acid HClO 4 solvent is a mixture of CCl 4 and ethylene dichloride.	3.464887494787778
This is a dielectric , resulting dilating constant and this is your kp liter mole inverse second inverse.	4.463581022858812
If you have pure CCl 4 , obviously , this is more non - polar , dielectric constant is 2.3 and the rate is low.	3.5979663885521593
When you increase the polarity by adding ethylene dichloride , dichloethane , EU , say in 40 - 60 mixture , your dielectric constant goes up , your reaction goes up.	4.317954881845573
If you consider further , 20 , 80 , 7 and this is 3.2 , 3.2 , 0 , 100 , 9.72 and this is 7.	4.9433802888408485
So , if this is the data to convince you , that if you increase the polarity , which is given by dielectric constant , the rate constant or the rate of the polymerization reaction increases.	2.912970595677694
So , we just discussed the propagation steps , now let us talk about different possible termination steps in cationic chain polymerization and as one more time , that it cannot , termination does not happen by bimolecular reaction of the propagating species and generally , the termination happens by transfer reactions.	2.8178584168303304
For example , one beta proton transfer to either monomer or counter ion or say polymer itself , solvent or some impurities , which is present or a transfer agent , like the case of chain radical polymerization , we talk about the chain transfer is possible.	3.0399304465371966
And for example , if we consider the beta proton transfer to monomer , I can write k transfer monomer just like the radical polymerization.	2.8106313138432686
If we consider the same examples of isobutylene polymerization by BF 3 and H 2 O , this can transfer beta proton to the monomer and can form this and plus the 2 2 beta proton , one is here and one is this hydrogen.	3.379894039242483
So , one , depending on which proton is leaving you can get actually two structures with double bond.	3.2672008682771803
The average perplexity is 3.1730702285171373
