Three major classes of continuous reactors are listed here.	3.384649349228227
You have continuous stirred tank reactor and the classical feature of a continuous stirred tank reactor is it is a type of a stirred reactor in which you give a continuous supply of substrates in the form of feed and the same volume at the same rate the product stream is taken out while retaining the immobilized enzyme preparation in the reactor stream.	3.355587253648137
The major characteristic feature of the continuous stirred tank reactor often denoted as CSTR is that the contents of the reactor are perfectly mixed or the system is totally homogeneous.	3.7802726817400685
That means the concentration of any particular species in the reaction system is uniform through out the content of the reactor and this concentration is same as that in the outlet stream.	2.8897659409656313
The concentration of any specie of a reaction system is homogeneous same at every point in the reactor and that is equal to the concentration at the product stream because it is a perfectly mixed system.	3.088092615311189
These characteristics makes a very unique situation and whenever contents in the reactor are at the same composition as in the product stream it implies that the concentration of the substrates in the reactor is at a level which is present in the outlet stream.	3.514968498923451
For example if you want to carry out a conversion of let us say a 95 % leaving back 5 % of the substrate that means the concentration of the substrate in the reactor will be only 5 % of that of the feed inlet.	3.2246436789697643
So the effective concentration of the substrate at which the reaction is taking place is much smaller than the substrate inlet stream concentration and therefore such reactions will be ideally suited for the enzyme catalyzed reactions which are strongly substrate inhibited because the effective substrate concentration in the reactor will be much lesser than the actual substrate concentration in the feed stream.	2.9208940219027713
So the inhibitory effect will be totally masked.	3.6491827673583175
On the other hand if the reaction is inhibited by the product then such reactors are not very suitable because the content in the reactor will also have a very high product concentration at any given time.	2.934380920212938
So therefore the reaction will always continue in a product inhibited design.	3.0087517380928688
So the reaction rate can be very slow.	2.3690117175331906
So therefore the reactors in the form of continuous stirred tank reactors are ideally suited for substrate inhibited reactions rather than product inhibited reactions.	3.3410243703736953
So that is one feature.	2.8417181664170017
The second category is plug flow reactors.	3.5110877347714347
Plug flow reactors or in a much boarder sense you can say packed bed reactors are probably one of the most commonly used types of reactors in the immobilized enzyme applications mainly because of the nature of the catalyst.	3.211372929220977
Because it is used in the form of either particles or films it can be easily packed in the system and can provide a very high catalyst density , enzyme density in the reactor system.	3.379950330373291
Higher the catalyst density the over all reaction rate can also be very high because the enzyme concentration per unit volume will be much higher compared to a CSTR.	3.106538530852492
But the basic characteristics of plug flow reactor is that the substrate inlet stream moves do they flat concentration profile or velocity profile along the length of a reactor.	3.6706328333171045
Consider an enzyme reactor.	2.3443316069910995
This is an enzyme reactor , a plug flow reactor and then consider the central axis , the velocity profile of the feed.	3.3263279815337774
This is s ; this is the product stream.	3.357631052988954
The concentration profile of the feed at any given cross section of the reactor is flat.	3.148891464608273
That means there are no actual dispersions and so the velocity profile of the feed stream throughout the length of the reactor is flat or in other words the feed inlet , the feed stream moves almost like a plug and therefore the name what we talk about as a plug flow reactor.	3.8009695490790802
They are packed bed systems and achieving a perfect plug flow condition may not be feasible in large scale reactors while in the case of small scale reactors by manipulating or by increasing the length to diameter ratio one can achieve a much better plug flow behavior.	4.179131812081139
But in the case of large reactors there are lot of deviations from the plug flow behavior which we will consider.	2.9923976497133244
They can be accounted in while we consider the reactor performance.	2.986093025398675
The third category of the continuous reactors are fluidized bed reactors.	3.242353092550874
They are somewhere between the continuous stirred tank reactors and the plug flow reactors and if you put the substrate feed at a speed high enough to lift the bed or fluidize the bed but not allow the catalyst particle to go out of the reactor , unlike in the case of a packed bed there is a static bed of the immobilized enzyme particles and the linear velocity of the feed is not large enough so that the bed can be disturbed.	3.5840389053447748
The characteristics of the bed can be theoretically numerically accounted by voidage what we call as a factor called epsilon which is the wide volume in the bed divided by the total packed bed.	4.4174971117186566
This will be a function of the particle shape and size.	2.7092353035657304
Particle shape and size will control the voidage in the packed bed but when you move ahead from the plug flow behavior and continue to increase feed velocity stream to a level that the bed is packed , bed is disturbed.	4.521450028383068
It gets fluidized ; the particles are fluidized in the reactor system almost like as shown here in the reactor but not to the extent that the catalyst particles are driven out of the reactor system.	3.1760551438745264
They are retained in the reactor system.	2.744703423644003
We call it fluidized bed ; fluidized bed immobilization reactor.	3.7935443213027527
Such reactors in terms of fluid dynamics probably provide a performance somewhere in between the CSTR and PFR but are ideally suited for the reactions which have a requirement of good heat and mass transfer because in many of the situations like in packed bed the heat and mass transfer may be very difficult and particularly in case of reactions which are exothermic in nature there might be lot of local heat hot spots which can inactivate the enzyme.	3.630094458293806
Fortunately in the case of enzyme catalyzed reactions , the reactions are not highly exothermic.	2.9702997090054284
They are usually isothermal and therefore the problem of heat transfer is not so severe.	3.6844510754371425
But even a smaller level of heat generated can be taken care very easily in case of fluidized bed reactors.	3.9763986706838974
Alternatively if your substrate is highly viscous or let us say colloidal in nature , in those cases also a fluidized bed reactor can provide you a much better system for carrying out immobilized enzyme reactions in a continuous mode.	3.5523111635342652
These are the three major classes of continuous reactors but in practice a number of hybrids of these reactor systems have been proposed by people both in the case of CSTR as well in the case of plug flow reactors.	3.50800057644928
In fact fluidized bed reactor itself is a hybrid between the two major classes.	3.9644197203394893
But even under CSTR a modification which has been proposed is in the form of CSTR coupled with the ultra filtration cell.	3.7018799429365408
Particularly in case where you want to carry out reactions using insoluble substrates or soluble enzymes and want to use a continuous reactor.	3.0536601826580108
For a soluble enzyme you cannot use a plug flow reactor.	2.661746192411454
So CSTR coupled with an ultra filtration reactor can be easily used for carrying out a reaction with the soluble enzyme or with insoluble substrates.	3.4688334938364283
In the case of soluble enzyme the use of plug flow reactor will drive away the enzyme simultaneously and you cannot use it continuously.	3.0724488322699157
In the case of a CSTR , you can use a soluble enzyme or along with a soluble or insoluble substrate by carrying out in a CSTR and coupling the CSTR with the ultra filtration module.	3.198152830915674
That is the reactor output instead of going directly to the product stream passes through ultra filtration unit in which the product stream is filtered out and can be taken out of the product stream while the retentate which contains mainly the enzyme is recycled back into the reactor.	3.8031266480045067
So it is a form of recycle reactor just like we saw in the case of total recycle packed bed which operates the batch reactor or even in continuous reactor recycle reactors can be used where part of the output stream is recycled and part is taken out as the product.	3.6652745158229814
In this case here we do the same thing ; a part of the output stream which is the filtrate from the ultra filtration unit is taken out to the product stream and the retentate of the ultra filtration unit is cycled back into the reactor and it can be operated in a continuous shift.	3.5734922524261505
So overall performance wise in terms of the reactor performance it can be considered almost similar to that of a CSTR.	3.377954101292228
There are two major modifications which has been proposed in the case of plug flow reactors.	2.985730916544785
While the conventional systems as we have seen use the packed bed and feed the substrate in either at the top of the column or at the bottom of the column either of the combination is feasible but they may also have some operational problems.	3.55866115911636
Of the two major modifications of that which have been proposed and have been used in the enzyme catalyzed reaction , one is a hollow fiber reactor.	3.081984775012721
In the case of hollow fiber the system is something like in a shell and tube reactor ; shell and tube heat exchanger type of situation where you have very fine capillary type of fibers which are semi permeable in which the enzyme can be entrapped.	4.672811650652747
The enzyme feed is put in , in the hollow fibers and the main feed substrate is passed through the cell side and because of the semi permeability of the hollow fiber membranes the substrate and the enzyme can come in contact.	3.4862534481302516
That means the substrate can go into the vicinity of the enzyme and product can go out and ultimately the product stream can be taken out but the enzyme cannot go out of the ultra filtration tubes and such a reaction system has an advantage that you can use such a system as a continuous plug flow reactors even using the soluble enzymes.	3.4111602932576175
While a packed bed system cannot be used in the soluble enzyme but a hollow fiber reactor can be used in soluble enzyme and particularly where contacting an enzyme and the substrate is a problem such reactors have been used and in terms of flow behavior , because of these hollow fibers being of the capillary size , very fine capillaries and a bundle is made so they almost provide a reactor performance in line with the plug flow barrier No.	3.812027238847291
In the hollow fiber tubes , capillary tubes is the enzymes contained and in space provided between the tubes and the cell the substrate feed is fed into it.	4.308476537310444
You are referring to this one.	3.0125711459700346
This is only a cross section of the system.	3.0544147962374972
In fact all the tubes at the top are joined in a section so that they come out in the same section.	4.1669079358828975
This is only a cross section shown here in the expanded form.	3.7362617898749884
The circles which you are seeing here they are blown up here in this form and they indicate one hollow fiber.	4.282155015050992
The whole reactor consists of a bundle of hollow fibers almost about eighty or hundred hollow fibers can be constituted in about one square inch of that order hollow fiber.	5.723119649313351
But there are systems reported in which they are on the tube walls.	4.032627890685866
The enzyme can be immobilized but alternatively in the general fashion it can also be in the form of soluble enzyme.	3.0365053560439534
When you say when you are immobilizing on the walls of the tube then they don ’t operate really on the hollow fiber reactor.	3.9951024251200615
Then it is almost like a packed bed reactor in which the tube side is used as the matrix and it is almost like a packed bed reactor.	3.3699602016684183
It doesn ’t matter whether you pack it in a horizontal fashion or a vertical fashion the tubes are used as the immobilized matrix whereas I am talking about that the enzyme which is used in the soluble mode.	3.92407583816714
It is retained in the semi permeable hollow fiber tubes so that it is not able to go out almost similar to microencapsulation where the enzyme is contained in the forms of tubes.	4.2609915593730205
The other noble modification of the plug flow system is a spiral membrane bound module.	4.329717370348872
It is a very specific configuration which has been reported and has been used industrially and this system has been used extensively for immobilized enzyme preparations which are in the form of thin films.	3.1658102830033297
The typical application which reversed is where the enzyme is immobilized on the collagen matrix in the form of thin films and you get a very long roll.	3.228404707753392
It can even also be used along with , like your fiber entrapped enzymes , if the fibers are woven in the form of a cloth or thing like that so that you get a very large surface area in the form of a film , long film.	4.1714510410155095
What is done is that this thin film of the enzyme containing enzyme is bound spirally on to central core.	3.8814962213520974
You take a central core on which spirally the enzyme sheet is wrapped around the core and in between to provide strength there is a matrix or there is a kind of a porous sheet which can keep the two enzyme sheets separated.	3.9934792603230007
It serves two purposes ; one is that it provides strength to the enzyme sheet.	3.928831972329161
The other is it also doesn ’t allow the enzymes system to get clogged and that can be packed into a column into a tube and such a system also can provide a very high enzyme loading because the surface area available on the thin film is very , very large and therefore it can provide a very high enzyme loading and also the system performs almost like a plug flow reactor.	3.6540103147084215
It operates almost like a packed bed system.	3.9713091500987066
Only thing is instead of packing the column with the particulate material what you are doing is the film is being wrapped along a core spaced by another sheet and then the whole core is inserted into a column.	4.205787165671549
So you can feed the substrate either from the top or the bottom and take out another stream.	3.7371024244396236
It is almost like a plug flow reactor.	2.5472580696020586
I must say that this is not the comprehensive list of the type of the reactors that has been reported.	3.528901460059402
Very large variations of reactor designs have been reported.	3.6161559353440027
Even for example in the case of a CSTR people have immobilized the enzyme on to the base of the …… and carryout the reaction.	2.94389642936745
So a variety of configurations had been used but some of them are purely of catalytic interest also.	4.155655877436068
But by and large from the fluid dynamics and reactor performance point of view they have to be classified on one of those standard operational modes.	3.6182418726435754
To sum up the type of reactors that are available the combined continuous stirred flow reactors with the ultra filtration system is useful with the soluble enzyme or along with the immobilized enzyme particularly by an insoluble substrates are required to be handled or colloidal substrates are required to be handled.	3.496578946227938
Because in the handling of colloidal substrates , you often find difficulty with the flux flow reactors.	4.251929776746239
So the combined CSTR coupled with the ultra filtration reactor can be easily used.	3.7652443850993436
Such reactors had been very poor in terms of long term operations mainly because of the adsorption of the enzyme on to the membrane surface.	3.3519410179895353
So most of the membranes provide a good adsorption surface and the enzymes get adsorbed on to that and the reactor performance is ….	3.2799531087025993
during continuous use.	2.6461273794283557
All the defects or all the limitations of an ultra filtration system will also be associated here.	3.841960302714594
The reaction system will have to face all the problems like concentration polarization of an ultra filtration system and unless those are taken care the reaction performance will be adversely affected.	3.594560412551425
One is that the system undergoes a very fast rate of deactivation mainly because you have to transfer the whole material along with the substrate into the ultrafiltration module and recycle back the retentate and so during that transfer there is a significant loss occurring.	3.8279685641103254
In most of these one of the reasons of activation is also ….	3.2567462087142673
inactivation and in case of even CSTR many of the enzymes or the carrier particles that are ….	3.440298330720856
sensitive or carriers which can go undergo lot of attrition during use the CSTR becomes a sort of a disadvantageous system because if the carrier particles get disintegrated during use it will involve the loss of enzyme.	4.031270512705999
In the case of CSTR , the most favorable point is that for reactions which are substrate inhibited , CSTR is a desirable feature.	2.8521536781767893
The other desirable feature of the CSTR is that it can be used wherever pH control is required because it provides you an open configuration in which the pH monitoring and control both can be exercised which is very difficult in the case of a plug flow reactor.	3.6146442517513964
In the case of a plug flow reactor you have a recycle system so that have an external loop in which the pH monitoring and control is exercised or otherwise in the ideal plug flow behavior the pH control is difficult.	3.868367893089815
But the CSTR provides an ideal tool and in many cases of immobilized enzyme reactions pH control is a requisite.	3.7090173095393695
Then in the case of CSTR even colloidal or insoluble substrates can be processed which is not feasible in the case of plug flow behavior and then easy replacement of catalyst.	3.465534156658185
While in the case of PFR or the plug flow reactor the regeneration of the carrier is simple because after the immobilized enzyme is exhausted one can stop for a while regenerate the carrier , reimmobilize the system and reuse.	3.395067705812724
If suppose the carrier cannot be regenerated and it has to be replaced the replacement of carrier is much simpler in the case of CSTR.	3.226047600754253
We have talked about higher yields for reaction undergoing substrate inhibition.	2.8638895207833706
Then in the case of plug flow reactors often it has been noted that the conversion efficiencies are much higher compared to CSTR and the major reason for that are two.	3.2046146652656415
We will see the quantitative analysis of the reactor performance in both the cases.	3.0074822936390984
But one of the major reason is that most of the enzyme reactions are inhibited if not very excessively but mildly by product concentration.	3.159388437017799
So the plug flow maximizes or minimizes the product concentration at any given point.	3.4299198841786227
The maximum product concentration is only at the outlet stream but across the reactor length the product concentration is much lesser than the outlet stream as the opposite happens in the case of a CSTR.	3.5004360473220597
So the reactor performance is much better usually in the case of PFR.	2.95701961039109
The second reason is that the enzyme loading per unit volume is much higher in the PFR compared to the CSTR.	3.464685257807909
In the CSTR , the concentration of the enzyme which you can …. .. usually is not very high when compared to the PFR.	3.112125693352355
The other category of enzyme reactor , fluidized bed reactor , as I mentioned earlier are much better suited for heat and mass transfer characteristics and freedom from plugging.	4.24684866510481
Very often if colloidal substrates are to be used a plug flow reactors faces problem in terms of plugging or choking of the column.	3.9314565651807376
Insoluble substrates can be used.	2.8237282724407042
Pressure drop will end the problem in the plug flow reactor because if you want to eliminate some of the problems associated with the internally bound diffusion in the system , the particle size has to be reduced and the reduction of particle size will mean increase in pressure drop across the bed and increase in pressure drop across the bed ultimately puts an economic barrier in terms of higher energy consumption for feeding the substrates and therefore in the case of very fine particles you can handle the system in a fluidized bed reactor without much pressure drop problems.	0
One of the disadvantage is the power requirement for fluidizing the beds because you need to feed the substrate at the very high linear velocities which requires a much higher power consumption and the scale up of the fluidized bed reactors has also been very largely empirical.	3.583164827343535
The scale up systems is more empirical compared to CSTR and PFR which are considered to be idealized reactor systems because in terms of fluid flow behavior they represent the two extremes.	3.9564154438211907
In one there is no actual dispersion ; in the other case there is complete back mixing.	3.570170522176518
So therefore their modeling or their arriving of electrode performance is much certain , much more defined and therefore the scale up can be easily carried out whereas in the case of fluidized bed reactor a scale up is more empirical.	4.240898875709518
There will not be much pressure drop because just like in the case of a packed bed reactor the particles are all compact.	3.41589369780935
So when you feed a substrate the pressure drop will be very large if the particle size is very fine.	3.3440455108388236
In the case of a fluidized bed reactor the voidage is very high.	3.0101897299699787
The voidage is almost approximating to that of CSTR ; not the same but it is approaching to that and therefore there is no pressure drop and the system has a very large voidage ; the voidage increases.	3.7682121087213587
Before we go into the reactor performance of different types of reactor for the immobilized enzyme systems , we cannot normally consider all the parameters like non - ideal fluid dynamics , the mass transfer constraints and along with the biochemical reaction we cannot really combine at one stage.	3.2233418796203224
We can take up those issues one by one and to begin with we can only consider an idealized enzyme reactor system.	3.854131679329982
We would like to make certain assumptions before we go into the reactor performance and the assumptions are that first thing we are assuming that the reactor undergoes an isothermal operation.	3.36023079881176
That means.	1.5243356139796316
H value of the reaction is not very high so that there is no temperature gradient in the reaction ; the first assumption.	2.515327911397732
Second is uniform enzyme distribution.	3.1903304579643015
In practice there are reports that even in an immobilized enzyme preparation itself there are no uniform enzyme distribution practically.	3.3767497105020454
But for theoretical purposes , we assume that the enzyme is distributed uniformly in the reactor whether it is a plug flow reactor or is a batch reactor or a CSTR.	3.471386215347567
The third condition is we are assuming either a plug flow behavior for packed bed or a completely back mix behavior for CSTR in terms of fluid dynamics.	3.9725848291939285
We are not considering anywhere that means even fluidized bed is not considered as an idealized reactor system.	3.655996073563541
So we are considering the two extreme conditions either a plug flow behavior or a completely back mix system.	3.889240291816501
Then we are also ignoring external film or internal pore diffusion limitations if any.	4.198787200081617
We are considering that there are no diffusional limitations.	2.8352697258279598
That means the rate of reaction is much slower than the rate of diffusion.	2.502657062583268
The rate of diffusion is fast enough.	2.8769573445351964
Then the last assumption is that there is no significant partitioning of substrate between bulk and the carrier phase.	3.0431781083645433
If the system follows such we can evaluate or conduct a reactor performance on the basis of biochemical reaction , their reaction kinetics and to do so the major reactor design parameters which have to be considered are listed here.	3.342835409896484
The first one is “tau ” which is the reactor space time in terms of V / Q.	4.375906637357065
Here V is the reactor volume and Q is the flow rate in the case of a continuous reactor.	3.0562266282508976
“tau ” in the case of the batch reactor is the batch reaction time.	2.6544549804694912
Then you have initial substrate concentration ; another parameter which we have to define in any problem of a immobilized enzyme or soluble enzyme reactor we first define the S0 , the batch time or the reactor space time in continuous reactors.	3.055937508020128
Then the total enzyme concentration in the system.	2.4575761770899245
When I say E0 , I think it will be desirable to also have the magnitude of kd , the deactivation constant.	3.550228505084539
Particularly it will be more important when we are talking of continuous operation where the reactor operation time is large enough the deactivation constant will also play a key role.	3.2281901742932524
Then the temperature of operation because deactivation also will depend on the operational temperature.	2.701017777147282
I would like to mention here that most continuous enzyme reactors are usually operated little below their optimum temperatures just to increase or reduce the kd values and increase the operational half life.	3.5974774148244473
Then pH ; pH here is not only monitoring but more important is the control of pH.	4.530946842964642
How are you exercising control of pH.	4.3367096891211885
Then fraction of conversion in the reactor which can be defined as ( S0 - S ) / S0.	3.1878443835282466
That means the concentration difference ; substrate concentration between the inlet and the outlet stream , the ratio of the two.	2.96848413435131
Then the reactor productivity is another parameter which is important.	2.710595178708836
X.S0 / tau.	9.44309729172427
X.S0 is the total product formed and tau is the space time per unit time , the amount of product formed per unit time.	4.033494976125752
If we consider S0 as the concentration term so that it becomes per unit volume also.	3.7235973681771424
Then the reactor capacity ; although under given set of conditions you may get certain kind of productivity for a reactor capacity will be given by the Vm.	3.8327196181961534
k2.E0.V.e *.	119.48920482245931
Here even in case of tau also we can multiply by voidage if you want to consider a broader picture of a packed bed reactor because this V , reactor volume is not the packed bed volume it is the volume of the fluid in the reactor.	3.7127789780188336
So the total bed multiplied by the voidage will give a fluid volume in the reactor.	3.56204622943604
In the case of CSTR voidage can be considered almost equal to one whether the volume occupied by the carrier is very , very small compared to the total reactor volume.	3.4898240783283687
Then reaction capacity can be given by k2.E0 which is Vm multiplied by the reactor volume and the voidage and then finally the important parameter is enzyme kinetics itself because the reactor performance will depend upon the reaction kinetics which controls the reaction.	3.1205399038048465
Mind that we are not considering under idealized reactor conditions.	2.993076511197614
Anything like diffusional limitations , partitioning effects and non - ideal fluid flow behaviour which we will consider subsequently one by one to arrive at the final reactor performance.	3.5833734427157666
Pr is reactor productivity and Cr is the reactor capacity.	4.439238341196049
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and in this lecture number 22 , we are going to continue our first half our discussion on chain copolymerization.	3.1671562301663214
We will cover the remaining parts of the chain copolymerization discussion we are having.	2.637920028642586
And then take from there I will start a new topic or new synthetic procedure namely ring opening polymerization.	4.018434219523882
Now , if you look at the slides we had during last 2 lectures the in our discussion on chain copolymerization , we basically covered these topics different types of copolymers , importance of copolymerization , and copolymer composition.	3.033926202721967
Then microstructures , alternate random blocky structure , how the reactivity difference between the monomers actually give this type of copolymer microstructure.	3.1742186920789828
And we have talked about copolymerization composition drift with time and then we talked about how the monomer reactivity ’s and different types of chain initiation , you know types of chain initiation , actually determine these values of the reactivity ratios.	2.946301330043453
In today ' s lecture we will just cover this treat of care we will talk about Q e scheme and then briefly about ionic copolymerization how that is different from radical copolymerization.	3.6375326603116656
And just a brief idea about the type of application this copolymers goes.	3.098736475495182
Now , in the last lecture we talked about different factors contributing to the reactivities of this the monomers and in turn the reactivity ratio the value of the reactivity ratio of these monomers.	2.8742641390245987
We talked about the resonance stabilization of the substituted group , we talked about the electron charge density , electronic charge density , we talked about the steric effect and so on.	3.2456483544543597
Now , all these factors actually contribute to the reactivity of the monomer in such a way that it is very difficult to distinguish , the contribution from each of these factors in the reactivity of the monomers.	2.901654189486336
Hence it is very difficult to get a quantitative idea or is very difficult to predict the reactivity ratios of the monomers from a given structure.	3.409155996340456
Nonetheless one semi empirical method proposed by Price and Alphre is often used very commonly to sort of get the reactivity ratios of different monomers , and a ranking between different monomers in terms of their reactivities.	5.093513696039756
And that is a semi empirical approach and this is the Q e ' s Q e scheme we are talking about.	5.362089002225336
And this is we talking a continue our discussion on radical copolymerization so it is applicable for radical copolymerization.	2.582351610919632
And this scheme is based on the assumption that the rate constant , rate constant of reaction between a propagating radical P this is a propagating radical P with a monomer , monomer m.	3.17801940862258
Now this rate constant can write k P m this is rate constant for reaction between a propagating polymer radical P and a monomer m is given by these expression , where this 2 terms are the reactivity measure of the reactivity of the polymer like radical.	2.925843056448846
And this is the measure of reactivity of the monomer and this two term e p and e m they are the measure of the electronic charges , electrostatic charges on the polymer radical and the monomer respectively.	3.4324210315870047
So , if I write from this the expression for r 1 which is given by k 1e 1 by k 1 2 I should write.	4.758175990708959
Now , this both cases the polymer radical is the same so this will get cancelled.	3.0221174134262885
So , I can write q for m 1 q for m 2 for 1 , 1 , 1 e m 2 , you can get the expression from k 1 1 for k 1 1 k 2 and so the ratio you get these two , this because is the same radical 1 and 1.	5.487855438006374
So , this cancel out so we get these were this is a the measure of reactivity of monomer 1 and this is the measure of reactivity of monomer 2.	3.353752338033853
This is the charges electrostatic charges on the polymer radical and the monomer.	2.995020979302314
Now , another assumption is made in this approach is that e p 1 is same as e m 1 and we can and we write this as e 1.	4.539586955365882
Assumption is that the electrostatic charge on the polymer radical , which has at the end in monomer 1 structure and the electrostatic charge on monomer is same.	3.116827262898419
And which will I think as e 1 so similarly , we can write e p 2 e m 2 as e 2.	7.335521279043962
So , again the assumption is that the electrostatic charge on the polymer radical and the monomer are same , if the monomer residual end of the polymer radical is same as the monomer we are talking about.	2.8286840234179245
So , if I can write , similarly for r 2 Q now because Q is always talking about related to monomer.	4.565409912914181
