Three major classes of continuous reactors are listed here.	3.3954315562164377
You have continuous stirred tank reactor and the classical feature of a continuous stirred tank reactor is it is a type of a stirred reactor in which you give a continuous supply of substrates in the form of feed and the same volume at the same rate the product stream is taken out while retaining the immobilized enzyme preparation in the reactor stream.	3.3670052985720784
The major characteristic feature of the continuous stirred tank reactor often denoted as CSTR is that the contents of the reactor are perfectly mixed or the system is totally homogeneous.	3.774406752543094
That means the concentration of any particular species in the reaction system is uniform through out the content of the reactor and this concentration is same as that in the outlet stream.	2.8950966586368243
The concentration of any specie of a reaction system is homogeneous same at every point in the reactor and that is equal to the concentration at the product stream because it is a perfectly mixed system.	3.0834393012713233
These characteristics makes a very unique situation and whenever contents in the reactor are at the same composition as in the product stream it implies that the concentration of the substrates in the reactor is at a level which is present in the outlet stream.	3.51304059904369
For example if you want to carry out a conversion of let us say a 95 % leaving back 5 % of the substrate that means the concentration of the substrate in the reactor will be only 5 % of that of the feed inlet.	3.207972648091726
So the effective concentration of the substrate at which the reaction is taking place is much smaller than the substrate inlet stream concentration and therefore such reactions will be ideally suited for the enzyme catalyzed reactions which are strongly substrate inhibited because the effective substrate concentration in the reactor will be much lesser than the actual substrate concentration in the feed stream.	2.924816962725979
So the inhibitory effect will be totally masked.	3.496285033363805
On the other hand if the reaction is inhibited by the product then such reactors are not very suitable because the content in the reactor will also have a very high product concentration at any given time.	2.940620874326679
So therefore the reaction will always continue in a product inhibited design.	3.0149972924562047
So the reaction rate can be very slow.	2.3745756290075533
So therefore the reactors in the form of continuous stirred tank reactors are ideally suited for substrate inhibited reactions rather than product inhibited reactions.	3.351281623176548
So that is one feature.	2.8472374633153983
The second category is plug flow reactors.	3.5387629127044296
Plug flow reactors or in a much boarder sense you can say packed bed reactors are probably one of the most commonly used types of reactors in the immobilized enzyme applications mainly because of the nature of the catalyst.	3.187246202727469
Because it is used in the form of either particles or films it can be easily packed in the system and can provide a very high catalyst density , enzyme density in the reactor system.	3.3880990817525656
Higher the catalyst density the over all reaction rate can also be very high because the enzyme concentration per unit volume will be much higher compared to a CSTR.	3.115155264059253
But the basic characteristics of plug flow reactor is that the substrate inlet stream moves do they flat concentration profile or velocity profile along the length of a reactor.	3.6715557176237184
Consider an enzyme reactor.	2.3587477711903526
This is an enzyme reactor , a plug flow reactor and then consider the central axis , the velocity profile of the feed.	3.33020011276163
This is s ; this is the product stream.	3.2719653330548506
The concentration profile of the feed at any given cross section of the reactor is flat.	3.152934617217606
That means there are no actual dispersions and so the velocity profile of the feed stream throughout the length of the reactor is flat or in other words the feed inlet , the feed stream moves almost like a plug and therefore the name what we talk about as a plug flow reactor.	3.801972299819558
They are packed bed systems and achieving a perfect plug flow condition may not be feasible in large scale reactors while in the case of small scale reactors by manipulating or by increasing the length to diameter ratio one can achieve a much better plug flow behavior.	4.183148693231443
But in the case of large reactors there are lot of deviations from the plug flow behavior which we will consider.	3.005891608382362
They can be accounted in while we consider the reactor performance.	2.9954267854754346
The third category of the continuous reactors are fluidized bed reactors.	3.2583544527912944
They are somewhere between the continuous stirred tank reactors and the plug flow reactors and if you put the substrate feed at a speed high enough to lift the bed or fluidize the bed but not allow the catalyst particle to go out of the reactor , unlike in the case of a packed bed there is a static bed of the immobilized enzyme particles and the linear velocity of the feed is not large enough so that the bed can be disturbed.	3.5960014411635473
The characteristics of the bed can be theoretically numerically accounted by voidage what we call as a factor called epsilon which is the wide volume in the bed divided by the total packed bed.	4.408967556263474
This will be a function of the particle shape and size.	2.720396953193414
Particle shape and size will control the voidage in the packed bed but when you move ahead from the plug flow behavior and continue to increase feed velocity stream to a level that the bed is packed , bed is disturbed.	4.476892635495852
It gets fluidized ; the particles are fluidized in the reactor system almost like as shown here in the reactor but not to the extent that the catalyst particles are driven out of the reactor system.	3.1847034970615695
They are retained in the reactor system.	2.752368221619137
We call it fluidized bed ; fluidized bed immobilization reactor.	3.7828163728010704
Such reactors in terms of fluid dynamics probably provide a performance somewhere in between the CSTR and PFR but are ideally suited for the reactions which have a requirement of good heat and mass transfer because in many of the situations like in packed bed the heat and mass transfer may be very difficult and particularly in case of reactions which are exothermic in nature there might be lot of local heat hot spots which can inactivate the enzyme.	3.625265267858687
Fortunately in the case of enzyme catalyzed reactions , the reactions are not highly exothermic.	2.9749522086727045
They are usually isothermal and therefore the problem of heat transfer is not so severe.	3.6953122376447727
But even a smaller level of heat generated can be taken care very easily in case of fluidized bed reactors.	3.991986614827275
Alternatively if your substrate is highly viscous or let us say colloidal in nature , in those cases also a fluidized bed reactor can provide you a much better system for carrying out immobilized enzyme reactions in a continuous mode.	3.5606790757374713
These are the three major classes of continuous reactors but in practice a number of hybrids of these reactor systems have been proposed by people both in the case of CSTR as well in the case of plug flow reactors.	3.5063851972654985
In fact fluidized bed reactor itself is a hybrid between the two major classes.	3.9350588061502276
But even under CSTR a modification which has been proposed is in the form of CSTR coupled with the ultra filtration cell.	3.7145317498224477
Particularly in case where you want to carry out reactions using insoluble substrates or soluble enzymes and want to use a continuous reactor.	3.064089653354447
For a soluble enzyme you cannot use a plug flow reactor.	2.674424408783136
So CSTR coupled with an ultra filtration reactor can be easily used for carrying out a reaction with the soluble enzyme or with insoluble substrates.	3.4677408687878843
In the case of soluble enzyme the use of plug flow reactor will drive away the enzyme simultaneously and you cannot use it continuously.	3.077583667115895
In the case of a CSTR , you can use a soluble enzyme or along with a soluble or insoluble substrate by carrying out in a CSTR and coupling the CSTR with the ultra filtration module.	3.222796433948652
That is the reactor output instead of going directly to the product stream passes through ultra filtration unit in which the product stream is filtered out and can be taken out of the product stream while the retentate which contains mainly the enzyme is recycled back into the reactor.	3.801188809225099
So it is a form of recycle reactor just like we saw in the case of total recycle packed bed which operates the batch reactor or even in continuous reactor recycle reactors can be used where part of the output stream is recycled and part is taken out as the product.	3.671760902810382
In this case here we do the same thing ; a part of the output stream which is the filtrate from the ultra filtration unit is taken out to the product stream and the retentate of the ultra filtration unit is cycled back into the reactor and it can be operated in a continuous shift.	3.587595615659381
So overall performance wise in terms of the reactor performance it can be considered almost similar to that of a CSTR.	3.3885598488789883
There are two major modifications which has been proposed in the case of plug flow reactors.	2.997903257381097
While the conventional systems as we have seen use the packed bed and feed the substrate in either at the top of the column or at the bottom of the column either of the combination is feasible but they may also have some operational problems.	3.5661667016390637
Of the two major modifications of that which have been proposed and have been used in the enzyme catalyzed reaction , one is a hollow fiber reactor.	3.08447823855873
In the case of hollow fiber the system is something like in a shell and tube reactor ; shell and tube heat exchanger type of situation where you have very fine capillary type of fibers which are semi permeable in which the enzyme can be entrapped.	4.648785327068546
The enzyme feed is put in , in the hollow fibers and the main feed substrate is passed through the cell side and because of the semi permeability of the hollow fiber membranes the substrate and the enzyme can come in contact.	3.488764478767912
That means the substrate can go into the vicinity of the enzyme and product can go out and ultimately the product stream can be taken out but the enzyme cannot go out of the ultra filtration tubes and such a reaction system has an advantage that you can use such a system as a continuous plug flow reactors even using the soluble enzymes.	3.4193970224770416
While a packed bed system cannot be used in the soluble enzyme but a hollow fiber reactor can be used in soluble enzyme and particularly where contacting an enzyme and the substrate is a problem such reactors have been used and in terms of flow behavior , because of these hollow fibers being of the capillary size , very fine capillaries and a bundle is made so they almost provide a reactor performance in line with the plug flow barrier No.	3.7986784571329224
In the hollow fiber tubes , capillary tubes is the enzymes contained and in space provided between the tubes and the cell the substrate feed is fed into it.	4.284287874308385
You are referring to this one.	3.01785315485545
This is only a cross section of the system.	3.0617114441925803
In fact all the tubes at the top are joined in a section so that they come out in the same section.	4.157905806478996
This is only a cross section shown here in the expanded form.	3.741093372390347
The circles which you are seeing here they are blown up here in this form and they indicate one hollow fiber.	4.216450430991173
The whole reactor consists of a bundle of hollow fibers almost about eighty or hundred hollow fibers can be constituted in about one square inch of that order hollow fiber.	5.593286604962294
But there are systems reported in which they are on the tube walls.	4.03360208677145
The enzyme can be immobilized but alternatively in the general fashion it can also be in the form of soluble enzyme.	3.0454532219866226
When you say when you are immobilizing on the walls of the tube then they don ’t operate really on the hollow fiber reactor.	3.9806349676835158
Then it is almost like a packed bed reactor in which the tube side is used as the matrix and it is almost like a packed bed reactor.	3.3854743264654252
It doesn ’t matter whether you pack it in a horizontal fashion or a vertical fashion the tubes are used as the immobilized matrix whereas I am talking about that the enzyme which is used in the soluble mode.	3.8993872577451123
It is retained in the semi permeable hollow fiber tubes so that it is not able to go out almost similar to microencapsulation where the enzyme is contained in the forms of tubes.	4.22227261107664
The other noble modification of the plug flow system is a spiral membrane bound module.	4.306392033011264
It is a very specific configuration which has been reported and has been used industrially and this system has been used extensively for immobilized enzyme preparations which are in the form of thin films.	3.175110442745441
The typical application which reversed is where the enzyme is immobilized on the collagen matrix in the form of thin films and you get a very long roll.	3.229147969178864
It can even also be used along with , like your fiber entrapped enzymes , if the fibers are woven in the form of a cloth or thing like that so that you get a very large surface area in the form of a film , long film.	4.061430587456621
What is done is that this thin film of the enzyme containing enzyme is bound spirally on to central core.	3.877912181240156
You take a central core on which spirally the enzyme sheet is wrapped around the core and in between to provide strength there is a matrix or there is a kind of a porous sheet which can keep the two enzyme sheets separated.	4.006975947092135
It serves two purposes ; one is that it provides strength to the enzyme sheet.	3.939766442361398
The other is it also doesn ’t allow the enzymes system to get clogged and that can be packed into a column into a tube and such a system also can provide a very high enzyme loading because the surface area available on the thin film is very , very large and therefore it can provide a very high enzyme loading and also the system performs almost like a plug flow reactor.	3.6471236158397113
It operates almost like a packed bed system.	3.9469496477883794
Only thing is instead of packing the column with the particulate material what you are doing is the film is being wrapped along a core spaced by another sheet and then the whole core is inserted into a column.	4.2147471946320385
So you can feed the substrate either from the top or the bottom and take out another stream.	3.747035386507649
It is almost like a plug flow reactor.	2.5686342101939723
I must say that this is not the comprehensive list of the type of the reactors that has been reported.	3.4945755271207095
Very large variations of reactor designs have been reported.	3.60030308688564
Even for example in the case of a CSTR people have immobilized the enzyme on to the base of the …… and carryout the reaction.	2.915703387637499
So a variety of configurations had been used but some of them are purely of catalytic interest also.	4.164320274187342
But by and large from the fluid dynamics and reactor performance point of view they have to be classified on one of those standard operational modes.	3.631105284539802
To sum up the type of reactors that are available the combined continuous stirred flow reactors with the ultra filtration system is useful with the soluble enzyme or along with the immobilized enzyme particularly by an insoluble substrates are required to be handled or colloidal substrates are required to be handled.	3.493807595817885
Because in the handling of colloidal substrates , you often find difficulty with the flux flow reactors.	4.1913005720602765
So the combined CSTR coupled with the ultra filtration reactor can be easily used.	3.764786005919301
Such reactors had been very poor in terms of long term operations mainly because of the adsorption of the enzyme on to the membrane surface.	3.3561131001515085
So most of the membranes provide a good adsorption surface and the enzymes get adsorbed on to that and the reactor performance is ….	3.2745901769705905
during continuous use.	2.64828417206763
All the defects or all the limitations of an ultra filtration system will also be associated here.	3.824649769602295
The reaction system will have to face all the problems like concentration polarization of an ultra filtration system and unless those are taken care the reaction performance will be adversely affected.	3.492655757281189
One is that the system undergoes a very fast rate of deactivation mainly because you have to transfer the whole material along with the substrate into the ultrafiltration module and recycle back the retentate and so during that transfer there is a significant loss occurring.	3.728665014168776
In most of these one of the reasons of activation is also ….	3.1785035005125013
inactivation and in case of even CSTR many of the enzymes or the carrier particles that are ….	3.3760025319338633
sensitive or carriers which can go undergo lot of attrition during use the CSTR becomes a sort of a disadvantageous system because if the carrier particles get disintegrated during use it will involve the loss of enzyme.	3.989386466076358
In the case of CSTR , the most favorable point is that for reactions which are substrate inhibited , CSTR is a desirable feature.	2.862229558931138
The other desirable feature of the CSTR is that it can be used wherever pH control is required because it provides you an open configuration in which the pH monitoring and control both can be exercised which is very difficult in the case of a plug flow reactor.	3.61843529784025
In the case of a plug flow reactor you have a recycle system so that have an external loop in which the pH monitoring and control is exercised or otherwise in the ideal plug flow behavior the pH control is difficult.	3.8459504557062774
But the CSTR provides an ideal tool and in many cases of immobilized enzyme reactions pH control is a requisite.	3.697640853087358
Then in the case of CSTR even colloidal or insoluble substrates can be processed which is not feasible in the case of plug flow behavior and then easy replacement of catalyst.	3.348552532805306
While in the case of PFR or the plug flow reactor the regeneration of the carrier is simple because after the immobilized enzyme is exhausted one can stop for a while regenerate the carrier , reimmobilize the system and reuse.	3.3031591498286157
If suppose the carrier cannot be regenerated and it has to be replaced the replacement of carrier is much simpler in the case of CSTR.	3.2402566928726877
We have talked about higher yields for reaction undergoing substrate inhibition.	2.8558585971235866
Then in the case of plug flow reactors often it has been noted that the conversion efficiencies are much higher compared to CSTR and the major reason for that are two.	3.213818731174684
We will see the quantitative analysis of the reactor performance in both the cases.	3.0177012286130487
But one of the major reason is that most of the enzyme reactions are inhibited if not very excessively but mildly by product concentration.	3.1524159025066245
So the plug flow maximizes or minimizes the product concentration at any given point.	3.4436651340786484
The maximum product concentration is only at the outlet stream but across the reactor length the product concentration is much lesser than the outlet stream as the opposite happens in the case of a CSTR.	3.510079344525541
So the reactor performance is much better usually in the case of PFR.	2.9683579687740536
The second reason is that the enzyme loading per unit volume is much higher in the PFR compared to the CSTR.	3.4749152281605484
In the CSTR , the concentration of the enzyme which you can …. .. usually is not very high when compared to the PFR.	2.9582767284817053
The other category of enzyme reactor , fluidized bed reactor , as I mentioned earlier are much better suited for heat and mass transfer characteristics and freedom from plugging.	4.252733351729656
Very often if colloidal substrates are to be used a plug flow reactors faces problem in terms of plugging or choking of the column.	3.9060204827853506
Insoluble substrates can be used.	2.814629524887386
Pressure drop will end the problem in the plug flow reactor because if you want to eliminate some of the problems associated with the internally bound diffusion in the system , the particle size has to be reduced and the reduction of particle size will mean increase in pressure drop across the bed and increase in pressure drop across the bed ultimately puts an economic barrier in terms of higher energy consumption for feeding the substrates and therefore in the case of very fine particles you can handle the system in a fluidized bed reactor without much pressure drop problems.	0
One of the disadvantage is the power requirement for fluidizing the beds because you need to feed the substrate at the very high linear velocities which requires a much higher power consumption and the scale up of the fluidized bed reactors has also been very largely empirical.	3.5830713190163883
The scale up systems is more empirical compared to CSTR and PFR which are considered to be idealized reactor systems because in terms of fluid flow behavior they represent the two extremes.	3.9657754562170915
In one there is no actual dispersion ; in the other case there is complete back mixing.	3.5791263282798513
So therefore their modeling or their arriving of electrode performance is much certain , much more defined and therefore the scale up can be easily carried out whereas in the case of fluidized bed reactor a scale up is more empirical.	4.24634331252105
There will not be much pressure drop because just like in the case of a packed bed reactor the particles are all compact.	3.4128783079545517
So when you feed a substrate the pressure drop will be very large if the particle size is very fine.	3.3502341581448207
In the case of a fluidized bed reactor the voidage is very high.	3.0048626786535557
The voidage is almost approximating to that of CSTR ; not the same but it is approaching to that and therefore there is no pressure drop and the system has a very large voidage ; the voidage increases.	3.74098122281581
Before we go into the reactor performance of different types of reactor for the immobilized enzyme systems , we cannot normally consider all the parameters like non - ideal fluid dynamics , the mass transfer constraints and along with the biochemical reaction we cannot really combine at one stage.	3.235413743108064
We can take up those issues one by one and to begin with we can only consider an idealized enzyme reactor system.	3.8610952351632033
We would like to make certain assumptions before we go into the reactor performance and the assumptions are that first thing we are assuming that the reactor undergoes an isothermal operation.	3.372970257149133
That means.	1.527698910641452
H value of the reaction is not very high so that there is no temperature gradient in the reaction ; the first assumption.	2.5262597276719796
Second is uniform enzyme distribution.	3.1942628155651573
In practice there are reports that even in an immobilized enzyme preparation itself there are no uniform enzyme distribution practically.	3.3795171726006674
But for theoretical purposes , we assume that the enzyme is distributed uniformly in the reactor whether it is a plug flow reactor or is a batch reactor or a CSTR.	3.4571200911152062
The third condition is we are assuming either a plug flow behavior for packed bed or a completely back mix behavior for CSTR in terms of fluid dynamics.	3.993303310134277
We are not considering anywhere that means even fluidized bed is not considered as an idealized reactor system.	3.663911168700057
So we are considering the two extreme conditions either a plug flow behavior or a completely back mix system.	3.9009112675311055
Then we are also ignoring external film or internal pore diffusion limitations if any.	4.190071621244091
We are considering that there are no diffusional limitations.	2.845109818126332
That means the rate of reaction is much slower than the rate of diffusion.	2.5074655974736606
The rate of diffusion is fast enough.	2.890052637204643
Then the last assumption is that there is no significant partitioning of substrate between bulk and the carrier phase.	3.0558308262912868
If the system follows such we can evaluate or conduct a reactor performance on the basis of biochemical reaction , their reaction kinetics and to do so the major reactor design parameters which have to be considered are listed here.	3.355480719139861
The first one is “tau ” which is the reactor space time in terms of V / Q.	3.897778092020324
Here V is the reactor volume and Q is the flow rate in the case of a continuous reactor.	3.0552465074305184
“tau ” in the case of the batch reactor is the batch reaction time.	2.597569244309107
Then you have initial substrate concentration ; another parameter which we have to define in any problem of a immobilized enzyme or soluble enzyme reactor we first define the S0 , the batch time or the reactor space time in continuous reactors.	3.066394167429193
Then the total enzyme concentration in the system.	2.4627440228540363
When I say E0 , I think it will be desirable to also have the magnitude of kd , the deactivation constant.	3.5509507505694824
Particularly it will be more important when we are talking of continuous operation where the reactor operation time is large enough the deactivation constant will also play a key role.	3.2390636520420286
Then the temperature of operation because deactivation also will depend on the operational temperature.	2.7068142568862834
I would like to mention here that most continuous enzyme reactors are usually operated little below their optimum temperatures just to increase or reduce the kd values and increase the operational half life.	3.585083472330413
Then pH ; pH here is not only monitoring but more important is the control of pH.	4.50650623317471
How are you exercising control of pH.	4.329878258349165
Then fraction of conversion in the reactor which can be defined as ( S0 - S ) / S0.	3.1957687940697617
That means the concentration difference ; substrate concentration between the inlet and the outlet stream , the ratio of the two.	2.9679738579761605
Then the reactor productivity is another parameter which is important.	2.7192594910214662
X.S0 / tau.	4.778241975462936
X.S0 is the total product formed and tau is the space time per unit time , the amount of product formed per unit time.	3.85638381438502
If we consider S0 as the concentration term so that it becomes per unit volume also.	3.7293774774102895
Then the reactor capacity ; although under given set of conditions you may get certain kind of productivity for a reactor capacity will be given by the Vm.	3.8367267867966146
k2.E0.V.e *.	33.72822774382063
Here even in case of tau also we can multiply by voidage if you want to consider a broader picture of a packed bed reactor because this V , reactor volume is not the packed bed volume it is the volume of the fluid in the reactor.	3.7161963688234474
So the total bed multiplied by the voidage will give a fluid volume in the reactor.	3.5408879069493118
In the case of CSTR voidage can be considered almost equal to one whether the volume occupied by the carrier is very , very small compared to the total reactor volume.	3.375894907820532
Then reaction capacity can be given by k2.E0 which is Vm multiplied by the reactor volume and the voidage and then finally the important parameter is enzyme kinetics itself because the reactor performance will depend upon the reaction kinetics which controls the reaction.	3.1228991910192905
Mind that we are not considering under idealized reactor conditions.	3.004538832783451
Anything like diffusional limitations , partitioning effects and non - ideal fluid flow behaviour which we will consider subsequently one by one to arrive at the final reactor performance.	3.573246268391928
Pr is reactor productivity and Cr is the reactor capacity.	3.667835116043087
Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and in this lecture number 22 , we are going to continue our first half our discussion on chain copolymerization.	3.163465632436012
We will cover the remaining parts of the chain copolymerization discussion we are having.	2.6455587756918426
And then take from there I will start a new topic or new synthetic procedure namely ring opening polymerization.	4.012134901868939
Now , if you look at the slides we had during last 2 lectures the in our discussion on chain copolymerization , we basically covered these topics different types of copolymers , importance of copolymerization , and copolymer composition.	3.035517769766165
Then microstructures , alternate random blocky structure , how the reactivity difference between the monomers actually give this type of copolymer microstructure.	3.1743125207611387
And we have talked about copolymerization composition drift with time and then we talked about how the monomer reactivity ’s and different types of chain initiation , you know types of chain initiation , actually determine these values of the reactivity ratios.	2.935412575884037
In today ' s lecture we will just cover this treat of care we will talk about Q e scheme and then briefly about ionic copolymerization how that is different from radical copolymerization.	3.6065765570600155
And just a brief idea about the type of application this copolymers goes.	3.1131096294181018
Now , in the last lecture we talked about different factors contributing to the reactivities of this the monomers and in turn the reactivity ratio the value of the reactivity ratio of these monomers.	2.878272090974509
We talked about the resonance stabilization of the substituted group , we talked about the electron charge density , electronic charge density , we talked about the steric effect and so on.	3.2588340534723423
Now , all these factors actually contribute to the reactivity of the monomer in such a way that it is very difficult to distinguish , the contribution from each of these factors in the reactivity of the monomers.	2.915063671812454
Hence it is very difficult to get a quantitative idea or is very difficult to predict the reactivity ratios of the monomers from a given structure.	3.4244475945508466
Nonetheless one semi empirical method proposed by Price and Alphre is often used very commonly to sort of get the reactivity ratios of different monomers , and a ranking between different monomers in terms of their reactivities.	4.879972135809624
And that is a semi empirical approach and this is the Q e ' s Q e scheme we are talking about.	4.840771297963052
And this is we talking a continue our discussion on radical copolymerization so it is applicable for radical copolymerization.	2.5925139973631994
And this scheme is based on the assumption that the rate constant , rate constant of reaction between a propagating radical P this is a propagating radical P with a monomer , monomer m.	3.1748016693456487
Now this rate constant can write k P m this is rate constant for reaction between a propagating polymer radical P and a monomer m is given by these expression , where this 2 terms are the reactivity measure of the reactivity of the polymer like radical.	2.924834256434023
And this is the measure of reactivity of the monomer and this two term e p and e m they are the measure of the electronic charges , electrostatic charges on the polymer radical and the monomer respectively.	3.4295469059565296
So , if I write from this the expression for r 1 which is given by k 1e 1 by k 1 2 I should write.	3.956557546509115
Now , this both cases the polymer radical is the same so this will get cancelled.	3.0211803829383994
So , I can write q for m 1 q for m 2 for 1 , 1 , 1 e m 2 , you can get the expression from k 1 1 for k 1 1 k 2 and so the ratio you get these two , this because is the same radical 1 and 1.	4.9369108048288
So , this cancel out so we get these were this is a the measure of reactivity of monomer 1 and this is the measure of reactivity of monomer 2.	3.349689830575495
This is the charges electrostatic charges on the polymer radical and the monomer.	2.998907829544559
Now , another assumption is made in this approach is that e p 1 is same as e m 1 and we can and we write this as e 1.	4.440196967841849
Assumption is that the electrostatic charge on the polymer radical , which has at the end in monomer 1 structure and the electrostatic charge on monomer is same.	3.1269938683123244
And which will I think as e 1 so similarly , we can write e p 2 e m 2 as e 2.	7.134437128467421
So , again the assumption is that the electrostatic charge on the polymer radical and the monomer are same , if the monomer residual end of the polymer radical is same as the monomer we are talking about.	2.8370067530508014
So , if I can write , similarly for r 2 Q now because Q is always talking about related to monomer.	4.0310880245065634
The average perplexity is 3.6089566897164156
