Welcome back to this course on polymer chemistry and in today â€™s lecture , which is lecture number seventeen , I am going to cover or begin our discussion on ionic chain polymerization.	3.2518141721068186
Now , in this lecture I plan to cover discuss the general characteristics of ionic chain polymerization , and while discussing I will compare how this ionic chain polymerization compares with radical chain polymerization.	3.0010196797682047
And then we will go to cationic chain polymerization and talk about different types of initiation for cationic chain polymerization , and then go to propagation and termination reactions in cationic chain polymerization.	2.4964456716548695
And then I will talk about kinetics of cationic chain polymerization and then energetics of cationic chain polymerization.	2.517040039207425
And in next lecture , I plan to talk about the other type of ionic polymerization , which is anionic chain polymerization.	2.6246878230500545
Now , let us begin our discussion on ionic chain polymerization.	2.7078815670810985
Now , as the name suggest , in this case the initiation is from an anionic species , whether it is a cation or anion.	3.212057756266698
Say , if I consider M as a monomer and I is a , initiation , initiator , then it could be a cation or an anion , which will , according to which we name cationic polymerization or anionic polymerization.	3.0169648390652677
It could be acceptance of electron giving rise to a radical anion or removal of an electron , which gives to radical cation , which two of which might combine to give you a dianion or a dication which can further initiate the chain reactions from both the sides.	3.6579537284770227
So , this is example , this is a case of cationic polymerization.	2.1451950415126446
This is a case of cationic polymerization and this two are the case of anionic polymerization.	2.3340734435644297
Now , in this case , the ionic species are the initiator or rather the initiators are ionic species , so as the propagating species also ionic.	2.9712753811442485
Now , the some polymerization , for example , initiation by coordination or semi clock side , which also progress through an ionic species , propagating , propagates through ionic species route , but those we are not going to cover as an ionic chain polymerization.	3.3994034212332136
So , ionic chain polymerization we will consider only when both the initiation and the propagation reaction is by ionic species.	2.5714407333533598
Now , like radical chain polymerization , these ionic chain polymers , polymerization reactions are not very popular commercially.	2.5042092243994674
There are main , too main reasons why they are not so utilized commercially.	3.948943806434124
One is that stringent requirement of polymerization in case of this ionic polymerization.	2.562989577090477
We require very , stringest , stringent conditions , which are difficult to achieve in a large industrial scale and also , this ionic polymerization are very selective , which means , that not every monomer can be polymerized by ionic polymerization , unlike , unlike radical case where most of the , poly , monomers , double bond monomers can be polymerized by radical chain polymerization we can assume.	3.224826662599607
So , these are the main two reasons why this ionic chain polymerization , are not practiced that commercially in that scale.	3.2221843392571627
And so in that sense , it is not that important like radical chain polymerization.	2.6754853832150247
However , this polymerization is ionic chain polymerization , gives us opportunity to synthesize specialized polymers , like block copolymers or tellically polymers , which are basically type polymers , having functional groups at the end of the chain , which we can , we utilized for the , for another reactions.	3.0136275380630697
So , let us start the discussion on ionic polymerization and let us talk about first the general characteristics.	3.015142129880622
And while talking these general characteristics of ionic polymerization we will compare its differences or its likeliness with the chain , radical chain polymerization.	3.082917604632103
First is that as I just said , that it is , it is much more selective , much more selective.	3.3119808668162882
Now , why do we started our discussion on chain polymerization.	2.6614999177660947
We talked about , that this monomers like this ether , which have electron donating group like there oxygen , which can be lone pair , can be donated if it is a cationic centre here.	3.6044205055248852
Now , this type of monomers can be polymerized by cationic chain polymer , polymerization reaction because the resulting cationic propagating can be stabilized by the electron donating , mechanizing donation by the oxygen from here.	2.792929004951867
Now , for anionics , for anionic chain polymerization we need to have monomers , which have electron withdrawing group , electron withdrawing group , which could be , as we discussed earlier , something like this , acrylates or methacrylates , and , and so on , with this can be polymerized anionically because the resulting anion can be stabilized by this resonating with the carbonyl bond.	3.0386720955212696
So , in that sense , this anionic and cationic polymerization at very and only if the monomer has , monomer with , monomers with , with inductive effect and ability to stabilize the propagating species by resonance in the , both for cationic and anionic , then this monomers can be polymerized by both cationic and anionic.	3.2357843912740814
So , if I write on the , complete this sentence , in that you can able to do , stabilize both cationic and anionic propagating species.	3.4013817185036372
For example , you have styrene where both cationic and anionic can be stabilized by resonance with this aromatic proof or say , cation , resulting cation or anionic can be stabilized by resonance from this double bond.	3.387762134535989
As we see , we have seen now from this discussion , that not every monomer can be polymerized by anionically and there is a set of polymer , a set of monomers , which can be polymerized anionically.	2.9562459244162556
And you know , less number of monomers can be polymerized cationically , and there are even lesser number polymers , which can be polymerized by both anionic and cationic polymerization.	2.8116386675398513
While in case of radical we have seen , that all this , this monomers or this monomers or this can be all polymerized by radical chain polymerization.	2.5880428854304354
So , in that case , in that composition radical is a , radical chain polymerization is much least sensitive compared to the ionic polymerization.	2.749836580802397
Now , second characteristics , if you want to talk about , is the effect of polarity , effect of polarity of the solvent.	3.16717762648287
It is not only polarity , but the capability of the solvent molecules to solvate the ionic species giving the chain propagation.	2.8934249184877703
Now , as you have seen earlier , that a propagation reaction can be this.	2.461650530831867
It is either cationic species or anionic species.	3.0469379196933515
Now , this anionic species or cationic species , they are not present alone in the medium , they are always associated with or accompanied by a counter ion.	3.433925953166772
For the positive it is a anion , for negative it is a cation.	3.3425272186804333
So , this propagating chain are always of this ionic group , are always accompanied by a counter ion of oppositely charged , that is always happens.	3.452466183026182
Now , depending on the association behavior of these two species , the active center and the counter ion , the reactivity of the propagating species varies.	2.8663569337338406
What I mean , that if they are very tightly bound , they are very tight , then obviously , the accessibility of , or the reactivity of this ionic center are less.	3.393062095362332
So , the propagating species is less reactive.	2.4934770100131196
While if you compare with the situation where they are well separated , they are like free , free hands.	3.1900144202433336
Now , if they are free , then obviously , they are more accessible and the reactivity of this propagating species , ionic propagating species are much more reactive or much more reactive compared to situation when they are tight ion - pair.	2.908389868143452
So , it is always preferred , that you have a polar solvent , it is , this is always preferred.	2.783607779255438
We do ionic reaction in a polar solvent because if you have polar solvent , then this oppositely charge ions , ions will be well separated in the medium and if they are well separated , obviously , the reactivity of the active center in the propagating chain will be higher.	3.0190423674298983
So , you have a higher rate of reaction or an eventually higher molecular build up.	2.8166560956891433
Now , often if you use polar solvent , for example if you use hydroxylated solvents , hydroxylated solvents like say , H 2 O or alcohol , what happens.	3.3566521008070582
This , this reacts , this hydroxylated solvents react very , very fast , you know , very effectively they react with this ionic species and then stop the chain.	3.0044594058326655
So , these ionic centers are destroyed with reaction of this hydroxyl , hydroxy molecules , H 2 O or alcohol.	3.524697147810408
If you have other polar solvents , like say ketone , what happens.	3.0847181232301653
This ketone loop complex form complex with this ionic species and then once they form complex , the reactivity of this ionic species are lost.	3.254697418868998
So , you do not have an effective polymerization happening.	2.394514260237617
So , you require a polar solvent to have these charges separated and ions as free as possible.	3.55077495621472
Similarly , if you use very high polar solvents , like hydroxylated solvents or ketone , then the reaction actually gets stopped by reaction of these solvent molecules with the reactive species.	2.810059028749346
So , eventually or practically , a low to moderate polarity solvents like , say methylene chloride or say , methylene dichloride or THF , or ether or nitrobenzene.	4.753327469290959
So , these are the examples of some of the solvents , which have , medium , low to medium polarity and does not high react with those ionic species.	3.0500328713984945
They , they actually can be used for ionic species polymerization , but this is , these are not very generic in the sense , that the solvents , this solvents also can react with anionic species as well.	2.97680233923217
So , we have , we will discuss specifically for the requirement of solvent.	2.3906923501204695
We will talk about cationic and anionic polymerization individually.	2.459909900743437
Now , how this , if you want to write a , a generic structure of , say , to write , write a cationic propagating species , which have , which a cationic reactive centre and a counter ion , which is represented by A minus , so what are the possible states they can represent.	3.4325585003982404
One , they can be completely covalent bonding , covalent bonded , covalent bonded , one.	4.023232633037349
Two , they can be tight ion - pair ; these are very tight , no solvent molecule in between.	3.4392378854748977
So , tight ion - pair or sometimes it is called contact ion - pair or see , some people say intimate ion - pair.	4.98462004826453
Same thing is called with different names.	3.579049399256736
It can be present as solvated.	3.276914854315163
So , solvated has three solvated ion - pair or loose ion - pair or they can be totally free , free ion - pair.	4.370026710500523
So , these are the possible , depending upon the polarity of the medium this could the four possible association state between these two ionic species.	3.0181826434872874
Now , it , we have given examples of cation and anion here where the propagating species is B plus , is said the both cationic polymerization , the propagating species in cationic polymerization.	2.7436719358319515
But it can be true ; this post can be true for the other anionic polymerization as well.	3.429017673102063
Now , obviously , with the increase in the polarity of the medium , if you increase the polarity of the medium , this , this , the more polar means , the ions get solvated and then finally , get as free ion , ion - pair.	3.1249969259984076
So , as the reactivity of the ionic centre , obviously , the free is the ionic center it gets , it becomes more reactive.	3.204380706740594
So , which means and in some cases these , these are not present isolately , they actually remain in equilibrium and equilibrium shifts depending upon the polarity of the medium.	3.14844554709691
So , in this way you can understand , that solvents play , solvent means , I mean polarity of the solvent plays a very important role in terms of reactivity of these ionic reactions.	3.1245752593437066
And if you compare with radical chain polymerization , solvent polarity actually has no such role to play in case of radical chain polymerization.	2.833972806090446
You have to only check whether the solvent can solubilize the monomer or the reagent and it , solvent should not participate in the undesired chain transfer reactions.	3.056427669329791
So , this type of solvent dependent reactivity was absent in case of radical chain polymerization.	2.5488144822641265
So , third characteristic we can talk about and compare the nature of reaction.	3.054804754929162
Now , this , these are complex reactions as we will find out from further discussion , that these are complex reaction and they are very fast.	2.7580166290475177
They are fast ; they are about , say , 10 to the power 4 to 10 to the power of 6 times of the reaction rate of radical chain polymerization.	2.8421028621496656
So , they are very fast and this fast nature of this reaction is due to the fact , that the accumulation of this active centers.	3.078821464826298
And as we will immediately discuss , that in case of ionic reaction , this bimolecular , molecular , termination bimolecular termination by reaction between two propagating species is absent or absent because they are anionic charge.	2.8806691387452514
One cation cannot react with another cation , cationic propagating species and terminate the reactions in case of radical.	2.797691372056185
What you have seen , that radical , two radical propagating species can react with each other and can terminate either by combination or by in case of cationic , anionic polymerization or cation polymerization.	2.9129421385464465
Because they have seen this propagation species are similarly charged , they cannot react with each other and terminate the chains.	2.7995656387465813
As a result , there is a huge increase in the concentration of these active centers in the medium and as a result , the reaction is very fast.	2.8784112396862636
But in case of radicals we have seen , that the steady state concentration of the active radicals is very low and as a result , the propagation was comparatively low in a slower , in compression to these ionic polymerization.	2.928851158232414
And as these ionic centers are very reactive , they are very sensitive to , very sensitive to impurities , which includes moisture because they are very active , reactive.	3.495714995041761
These ionic centers are very reactive , they are very sensitive to this impurities where you know , that radical , though radical chain polymerization are sensitive to impurities , but they are not as radical chain polymerization , is not as sensitive as in case of ionic chain polymerization and sometimes large effect of , large effect of cocatalyst.	3.139211990951206
Cocatalyst are nothing but small inorganic compounds , like say H 2 O , can be observed in case of ionic polymerization have , which was not the case of radical polymerization.	3.095350613953135
And as the reaction is very fast and complex , this kinetic data , kinetic data are often , often not reproducible because this kinetic data is not always reproducible , especially in this case of kinetics , especially in case of cationic polymerization , cationic , the mechanism and the mechanism on kinetics of this ionic polymerization , especially cationic chain polymerization is still not completely understood , to understand the mechanism in kinetics of this ionic polymerization , especially the cationic one , because as I said , these reactions are very fast and not reproducible.	3.1267178390507864
And as I said earlier , this four is your , the termination reactions.	2.952669002060403
As I said , that bimolecular termination is not possible , bimolecular termination by the action of two propagating species is not possible and so if you can suppress the other , other reactions , which are chain transfer reaction , if you can suppress those , you can actually keep this chains , this ionic chains as living because you can , because the inherent or intrinsic termination reaction between the propagating species are not there , they are absent.	2.913288488165936
So , if you can stop the side reactions , which includes the chain transfer reaction , then you can actually make this chain alive or this polymerization could be living polymerization and that is especially true for anionic polymerization.	2.6836297427837796
You will find out in later discussion , that in case of cationic there are other ways , which are likely like chain transfer reactions , but in case of anionic it is comfortably easy to make polymerization , leaving chain polymerization.	3.0837572372004964
Whereas , in case of radical , we know , that this termination can be possible by bimolecular reaction of the two propagating new species.	2.8121794699126452
So , let us now talk in detail about the cationic polymerization.	2.859791629083358
So , let us talk about and again , like radical polymerization if any chain polymerization , this cationic chain polymerization we were discussing.	2.493641831314641
So , I should write cationic chain polymerization.	2.2562715399609994
So , it consists of three steps : initiation , propagation and termination.	2.9677675852339065
First , let us talk about different types of initiation reactions , different types of initiation reaction and first one is , which is more common is , by reaction of monomer with an electrophile , say R plus and this electophile could be H plus , which you get it from protonic acids.	3.2096939382295875
Now , if I write generic way , H plus plus A , generic structure of a monomer , it gives you CH 3 CH Y , cationic species , and A minus.	4.012887940234687
This is counter A minus , is the counter ion.	3.68944682814859
Now , HX would be strong enough if these acids should be stronger enough to produce significant concentration of the protonal species , so that it can initiate , react with the monomer.	3.358195486736845
And A minus , the counter ion , should not be heavy , strong nucleophile because if it is a very strong nucleophile , then it can react with the cationic group and make a covalent bond and stop the reaction there itself.	3.414430925600362
For example , if I consider a case of halogen acids like HX and take the generic structure of the monomer with the reaction , we put on electrophilic reaction , it will form the same initiating species , but because this halogen anion is , is so strong nucleophile , it will actually combine again and form a covalent bond.	3.438677119777317
So , your reaction stops there.	2.529357876811421
You cannot have the reaction progressing further.	2.7164145024991333
So , so other protonic acids like H 2 SO 4 or say , HClO 4 or phosphoric acid.	4.4979932017061435
They are used , they can be used because this counter ions are not so strong nucleophile like halide ions , but still this , this , because they are , they are also significantly nucleophilic , this cannot built very high molecular with polymers by cationic chain polymerization.	3.130245060554459
So , these are limited and the molecular weight , molecular weights are not very high for this proton by this reaction , cationic reaction by this protonation.	2.6122920591575975
So , most , most popular , most important , this electrophilic reaction is reaction of Lewis acids.	3.3622706743277466
So , that is B , with the Lewis acid I can write generic structures like MX n for Lewis acids.	4.07580884481364
Example could be BF 3 , AlCl 3 , SnCl 4 , SlCl 5 , ZnCl 2 , TiCl 4 , and so on , or they are derivatives , like RaCl 2 , R 2 AlCl and so on.	4.667658289912918
So , these are Lewis , Lewis acid can be used for supplying an electrophile for reaction with the monomer , but it is this Lewis acids are seldom used alone.	3.5723499723284595
For example , if you take a reaction of isobutylene plus anhydrous BF 3 , anhydrous BF 3 , then there is no reaction.	3.1137520771908727
But at the moment you add little bit of water along with this mix , so you have the same reaction with BF 3 plus H 2 O , then there is a rapid reaction.	3.6341134785154243
So , these examples showing as these Lewis acids , which we just showed in the last page , they are often used along with a second catalyst or cocatalyst , which can be water molecules or some other molecules.	3.320417986606696
We will just give examples in few minutes.	3.0846625792617246
So , if you consider this case the reaction happens like this.	2.3137618705345404
BF 3 plus H 2 O makes a complex or we can use other Lewis acids and we can use this alkyl halides as a cocatalyst and this case , the complex found is like this.	3.5072565642787628
So , this case , this is a protogen , which is basically proton donor protogen and this is cationogen , which is a cationic species donor or carbocationic , carbocation donor.	3.822765615977038
Now , this is called nowadays initiator because this is the species , which is supplying the H plus or R plus.	3.1914567646481498
This is coinitiator , coinitiator , BF 3 or AlCl 3 are , sometimes they are called this BF 3 or AlCl 3 , called catalyst and this initiator called cocatalyst.	4.0944777399059875
So , you should be careful about this nomenclature , other you called this as initiator and coinitiator or you called this as catalyst and this is the cocatalyst.	3.595395660348524
Now , I can write generic reaction for this type of reaction.	2.6430800077455947
Now , once you form this , again react with the monomer and form the initiating species , which let us write in next page.	3.074290797054041
Similarly , you can write this similar reaction for this aluminum chloride and alkyl halide reaction.	3.0523692204051565
This alkyl halide could be , say for example , R could be tertiary carbon or could be a triphenyl carbon group.	4.171553163378188
So , this is example of alkyl halide , which is used for this cocatalyst or initiator in this reaction.	2.821869423221229
So , I , I can write a generic equation or expression , say I , I for the initiator and YZ , this is for your coinitia , I for the coinitiator , this is for the initiator or this for catalyst and this is for the cocatalyst , giving rise to a cationic species and a counter ion.	3.648442993861198
This is I and which then react with a monomer forming the chain initiating spices.	3.4548945828315256
Now , we are writing ki for this reaction because it has been found out , that of these two reactions , this is the two reactions , consists of chain reaction , chain initiation reaction.	2.888263732272879
This , this is the step , which is rate determining step.	2.713157717255903
So , we will consider this reaction while calculating or while determining the , or looking at the kinetics of this chain polymerization.	2.869534693100274
Remember , if you compare with the radical chain polymerization , this was the first reaction compared to the step , the first step , where radical was getting generated from the initiator molecule and we considered that as a rate determining step for radical chain polymerization.	2.6523179044114693
But in this ionic chain polymerization we , this is the faster reaction step where this is the slower and rate determining step.	2.828642072688353
So , for ionic reaction monomer also participate in the chain initiation reaction where in case of radical monomer was not actually part of the chain initiating expression Now , the reaction rate also depend , depends on this YZ , which is basically a cocatalyst.	2.934008947207384
It will also influence the polymerization rate because the activity of the initiation complex depends how readily it can transfer a proton to the monomer and that in turn depends on the acidity of this cocatalyst.	3.071430256864258
For example , if I consider ionic , cationic polymerization of isobutylene by tin chloride catalyst , then the reactivity of this reaction or the rate of reaction follows Rp , follows in the order like this , nitroethane , nitroethane , phenol , water , which is basically the ranking of the acidity of this cocatalyst.	3.453496517205972
So , basically the type of cocatalyst also influence the polymerization because the acidity of this , this complex , the activity of this complex depends on how readily it can supply this cationic species , where I say proton or in this case it is a proton or a carbocation to the monomer , and for a proton or protogen or a proton supplier , it depends on the acidity of the cocatalyst.	3.17044458458337
So , it follows this trend and for the carbon cationic generator like RCl , like AlCl 3 plus , this reaction.	3.5838985643243033
Now , this reaction complex , the , the activity , the total polymerization rate dependence on this RCl is little complex and we will keep the discussion for this course.	2.8176159092232
So , you should just remember that the , the structure of the cocatalyst also determines the rate of polymerization and also affect the rate of polymerization , and we will now see that.	2.6836247123840473
Obviously , I , the catalyst or the coinitiator also affects the rate of polymerization.	2.671624277827589
Now , now Lewis , Lewis acid , we are talking about this reaction are the initiation , is by Lewis acids.	3.2443283812769503
So , Lewis acidity of these defined metals increases with atomic number.	4.074234861775555
We know that Lewis acidity follow this order.	3.4926457017617634
This Lewis acidity of this defined metals increases with the atomic numbers.	3.9115775473258765
So , for a single metal , say , if we consider titanium , then again the Lewis acidity increases with the oxidation number.	3.5299398664112482
So , TiCl 4 have more Lewis acidity compared to , Tl , TiCl 3 than this.	4.36380934354175
So , for , if you compare with defined , different metal is basically atomic number.	3.2147971075540194
It will determine the Lewis acidity and for same , same metal is the oxidation state increases , the Lewis acidity increases and also the Lewis acidity.	3.503845397617179
For a single metal follow this trend of the ligand.	4.126013955010922
If this ligand , they follow this , so obviously , if the ligands are fluorine or chloride , they have much more Lewis acidity compared to the ligands are , this is , this is from your basic knowledge from inorganic chemistry , basic knowledge and this is , from this expression , you know , this is strongest Lewis acid and this is , not always we use this though it is a very strong Lewis acid , for all the cationic reaction.	3.4983027210752953
We will not use this as a catalyst or a coinitiator because rather than other complication if the reaction , it is too fast , then the side reactions also come in the picture , the side reaction also increases.	3.1437154739153708
If the side reaction rate also increases , then again the problem of molecular build up come.	2.866947213270195
So , though this trend is there , now while choosing the catalyst or the coinitiator , it is , it is not this general trend is always followed , you have to keep the other factors in mind as well.	3.7768614252944936
So , we talked about the initiator reaction with by this reaction of the monomers with the electrophile.	2.444294515937519
Now , there are other initiation reactions , other initiation reactions , for example , halogen , halogen can be reacting with more acidic Lewis acid and gives out cation , halogen cation.	3.492329625108507
This can be initiation ; can be done by photo initiation of olium salts.	3.8721872525746557
It can be done by electro initiation where cationic species is formed by electrolysis of any species present in the medium or it can be done by ionic , ionization radiation , like in the case of radical the initiation can be done by ionization.	3.309120790538733
So , these are the other possible ways of initiating a cationic polymerization.	2.679578374083153
But as I mentioned in earlier , these are the generic examples , which we get in this page.	3.4705519989361315
These are the most common example of or the most important initiation reaction.	2.7739985997246657
So , we will talk about kinetic.	2.2486298797051596
So , energetic , we will consider this generic initiation step and also consider this initiation step , of , for the discussion because this is the most important of the initiation step we just discussed.	3.0408079671570136
So , let us now discuss the propagation step.	2.583888199367763
Propagation , we have already seen the different types of initiation possibility and as I said , we will consider the generic case , we , as I showed there.	3.0798039282779253
So , this , this was the initiation reactions.	2.3333445473669463
So , you have this initiator , coinitiator complex , which starts the chain initiation.	2.7900523718714303
I write this in the next page , it can react with the name and start the chain propagation reaction and I can write a generic expression of this in this way plus M kp n plus 1 M plus IZ minus.	3.3051617164733327
If Y is H , the photogens we can write H M n M plus IZ minus.	4.917694873919378
For examples , that Ba 3 water case , I can write this is a proton donor.	3.9179781599548167
So , I can writeâ€¦ This is the reaction of isobutylene catalysed by this reaction.	2.7481197857132216
I just recall from your earlier decision , I am writing the propagating reactions here.	3.527624950582634
This , on reacting on with isobutylene , will produce the.. ... So , these are the examples of the propagating steps and sometimes this propagation reaction could be complicated and because of this one two hydride shift , but that is not very common.	2.962679298002895
I will just give you an example when this propagating steps could be little complicated and by hydride shift or shift and that is applicable for say , propene or one alkene , one alkenes , take example.	3.849732400545663
Now , this can undergo a hydride shift and from this carbo cation.	3.0840476898770524
So , as a result more complicated products actually form when there is type of hydride shift or some cases methide shift , some cases shift one two methide shift.	4.102955121567385
If this happens , the reactions become very complicated and we call that sometimes isomerization polymerization as well.	2.8860232801092716
But this is not common ; this is especially applicable to some monomers.	3.1437788446052233
The example we gave , most common propagation steps are in this page , what we just discussed now and as you can realize , that the rate of propagation will depend on the solvents.	2.987625911170289
We discussed in length the effect of solvent polarity and if the polarity of the solvents is high , then this ion - pair will be more towards a solvated or free ion - pairs , then in the reactivity of this cationic species will be higher.	3.0530483547821206
So , the rate of polymerization will be higher.	1.9261763945417312
Now , let us have , let us see some data related to convince that understanding.	4.2451051912317785
Say , let us take example of styrene , polymerization of styrene by or chloric acid HClO 4 solvent is a mixture of CCl 4 and ethylene dichloride.	3.5432189850852676
This is a dielectric , resulting dilating constant and this is your kp liter mole inverse second inverse.	4.586985084381667
If you have pure CCl 4 , obviously , this is more non - polar , dielectric constant is 2.3 and the rate is low.	3.646300446165806
When you increase the polarity by adding ethylene dichloride , dichloethane , EU , say in 40 - 60 mixture , your dielectric constant goes up , your reaction goes up.	4.502810975488554
If you consider further , 20 , 80 , 7 and this is 3.2 , 3.2 , 0 , 100 , 9.72 and this is 7.	5.203344358309636
So , if this is the data to convince you , that if you increase the polarity , which is given by dielectric constant , the rate constant or the rate of the polymerization reaction increases.	2.9099980076511436
So , we just discussed the propagation steps , now let us talk about different possible termination steps in cationic chain polymerization and as one more time , that it cannot , termination does not happen by bimolecular reaction of the propagating species and generally , the termination happens by transfer reactions.	2.8081525861793484
For example , one beta proton transfer to either monomer or counter ion or say polymer itself , solvent or some impurities , which is present or a transfer agent , like the case of chain radical polymerization , we talk about the chain transfer is possible.	3.0282624078239624
And for example , if we consider the beta proton transfer to monomer , I can write k transfer monomer just like the radical polymerization.	2.80069736311283
If we consider the same examples of isobutylene polymerization by BF 3 and H 2 O , this can transfer beta proton to the monomer and can form this and plus the 2 2 beta proton , one is here and one is this hydrogen.	3.364537062608996
So , one , depending on which proton is leaving you can get actually two structures with double bond.	3.25187745642256
The average perplexity is 3.1803385473993355
